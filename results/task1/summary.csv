This prospective cohort study of patients with acute stroke and atrial fibrillation, evaluated (1) the risk of recurrent ischemic event and severe bleeding; (2) the risk factors for recurrence and bleeding; and (3) the risks of recurrence and bleeding associated with anticoagulant therapy and its starting time after the acute stroke. METHODS The primary outcome of this multicenter study was the composite of stroke, transient ischemic attack, symptomatic systemic embolism, symptomatic cerebral bleeding and major extracranial bleeding within 90 days from acute stroke. RESULTS Of the 1029 patients enrolled, 123 had 128 events (12.6%): 77 (7.6%) ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack or systemic embolism, 37 (3.6%) symptomatic cerebral bleeding, and 14 (1.4%) major extracranial bleeding. At 90 days, 50% of the patients were either deceased or disabled (modified Rankin score ≥3), and 10.9% were deceased. High CHA2DS2-VASc score, high National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, large ischemic lesion and type of anticoagulant were predictive factors for primary study outcome. At adjusted Cox regression analysis, initiating anticoagulants 4 to 14 days from stroke onset was associated with a significant reduction in primary study outcome, compared with initiating treatment before 4 or after 14 days: hazard ratio 0.53 (95% confidence interval 0.30-0.93). About 7% of the patients treated with oral anticoagulants alone had an outcome event compared with 16.8% and 12.3% of the patients treated with low molecular weight heparins alone or followed by oral anticoagulants, respectively (P=0.003). CONCLUSIONS Acute stroke in atrial fibrillation patients is associated with high rates of ischemic recurrence and major bleeding at 90 days. This study has observed that high CHA2DS2-VASc score, high National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, large ischemic lesions, and type of anticoagulant administered each independently led to a greater risk of recurrence and bleedings. Also, data showed that the best time for initiating anticoagulation treatment for secondary stroke prevention is 4 to 14 days from stroke onset. Moreover, patients treated with oral anticoagulants alone had better outcomes compared with patients treated with low molecular weight heparins alone or before oral anticoagulants.",7e4niv98

DESIGN A consensus committee of 68 international experts representing 30 international organizations was convened. Nominal groups were assembled at key international meetings (for those committee members attending the conference). A formal conflict of interest policy was developed at the onset of the process and enforced throughout. The entire guidelines process was conducted independent of any industry funding. A stand-alone meeting was held for all subgroup heads, co- and vice-chairs, and selected individuals. Teleconferences and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee served as an integral part of the development. METHODS The authors were advised to follow the principles of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system to guide assessment of quality of evidence from high (A) to very low (D) and to determine the strength of recommendations as strong (1) or weak (2). The potential drawbacks of making strong recommendations in the presence of low-quality evidence were emphasized. Some recommendations were ungraded (UG).

Recommendations specific to pediatric severe sepsis include: therapy with face mask oxygen, high flow nasal cannula oxygen, or nasopharyngeal continuous PEEP in the presence of respiratory distress and hypoxemia (2C), use of physical examination therapeutic endpoints such as capillary refill (2C); for septic shock associated with hypovolemia, the use of crystalloids or albumin to deliver a bolus of 20 mL/kg of crystalloids (or albumin equivalent) over 5 to 10 mins (2C); more common use of inotropes and vasodilators for low cardiac output septic shock associated with elevated systemic vascular resistance (2C); and use of hydrocortisone only in children with suspected or proven ""absolute""' adrenal insufficiency (2C). CONCLUSIONS Strong agreement existed among a large cohort of international experts regarding many level 1 recommendations for the best care of patients with severe sepsis. Although a significant number of aspects of care have relatively weak support, evidence-based recommendations regarding the acute management of sepsis and septic shock are the foundation of improved outcomes for this important group of critically ill patients.",1uwyrst6

This study analyzed the risk factors and management of hemorrhagic complications, such as hemoperitoneum, hemothorax, and hemobilia. METHODS We performed 4133 RFA treatments in 2154 patients with primary and metastatic liver tumors from February 1999 to December 2007. Of these, we enrolled patients with hemorrhagic complications and reviewed their medical records thoroughly. The risk factors for each hemorrhagic complication were analyzed using unconditional logistic regression. RESULTS Hemorrhagic complications occurred in 63 out of 4133 treatments (1.5%), including hemoperitoneum in 29 (0.7%), hemothorax in 14 (0.3%), and hemobilia in 20 (0.5%). Eleven, 8, and 4 of these patients, respectively, were categorized as major complications requiring blood transfusion or drainage. Two patients died after hemoperitoneum. Logistic regression analysis revealed large tumor size [odds ratio (OR) 1.06 per 1 mm increase in diameter] and low platelet count (OR 0.88 per 10,000/microL increase) were significant risk factors for hemoperitoneum. The location of tumor nodules was a significant risk factor for hemothorax (segment 7, OR 2.31) and hemobilia (segment 1, OR 3.30). Other factors, including the number of needle insertions or the duration of ablation, were not significant. CONCLUSIONS Although hemorrhagic complications were relatively rare with percutaneous RFA, specific treatments, such as blood transfusion and drainage, were required in some cases.

The aim of the study was to retrospectively assess the efficacy and safety of Precipitating Hydrophobic Injectable Liquid (PHIL), a new nonadhesive liquid embolic agent, in the treatment of patients with cranial dural arteriovenous fistulas. The primary end point was the rate of complete occlusion of dural arteriovenous fistulas. Secondary end points included the incidence of adverse events and clinical status at 3-month follow-up. MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a retrospective multicenter study. Twenty-six consecutive patients with dural arteriovenous fistulas (de novo or previously treated) treated by injection of PHIL only or with PHIL in combination with other embolization products (such as Onyx or detachable coils) were included in the study. Recruitment started in August 2014 and ended in September 2015. RESULTS Twenty-two (85%) patients were treated with PHIL only, with 3 patients treated with both PHIL and Onyx, and 1, with both PHIL and coils. Immediate complete angiographic occlusion was achieved in 20 (77%) patients. Of the 6 patients with residual fistulas, 3 were retreated with PHIL and 1 achieved angiographic cure. An adverse event was seen in 1 patient who developed worsening of preexisting ataxia due to acute thrombosis of the draining vein. CONCLUSIONS PHIL appears to be safe and effective for endovascular treatment of cranial dural arteriovenous fistulas. Short-term angiographic and clinical results are comparable with those of Onyx, with the added advantage of easier preparation and improved homogeneous cast visualization. The use of iodine as a radio-opacifier also produces considerably less artifacts on CT compared with tantalum-based embolic materials.",mqg4pp8e

This study assesses its efficacy in patients admitted to critical care following cardiovascular surgery and the influence of standard antithrombotic agents routinely used in this specific group. METHODS Consecutive cardiovascular surgery patients treated with post-dilution hemofiltration with RCA were included in this prospective observational study. The primary outcome of the study was CRRT circuit life-span adjusted for reasons other than clotting. The secondary outcome evaluated the influence of standard antithrombotic agents (acetylsalicylic acid [ASA], low molecular weight heparin [LMWH] or fondaparinux as thromboprophylaxis or treatment dose with or without ASA) on filter life. RESULTS Fifty-two patients underwent 193 sessions of CVVH, after exclusion of 15 sessions where unfractionated heparin was administered. The median filter life span was 58 hours. Filter life span was significantly longer in patients receiving therapeutic dose of LMWH or fondaparinux (79 h [2-110]), in comparison to patients treated with prophylactic dose of LMWH or fondaparinux (51 h [7-117], p < 0.001), and patients without antithrombotic prophylaxis (42 h [2-91], p < 0.0001). 12 bleeding episodes were observed; 8 occurred in patients receiving treatment dose anticoagulation, 3 in patients receiving prophylactic dose anticoagulation and 1 in a patient with no antithrombotic prophylaxis. CONCLUSIONS A post dilution hemofiltration with RCA provides prolonged filter life span when adjusted for reasons other than clotting. Patients receiving treatment dose anticoagulation had a significantly longer filter life span than those who were on prophylactic doses or ASA alone.",stmu1j0j

Patients were randomized to standard care or standard care + noradrenaline infusion. Low-dose noradrenaline improved intraoperative platelet aggregation and clot formation. Noradrenaline may be considered to improve intraoperative hemostasis during cardiac surgery. SUMMARY: Background New approaches to prevent bleeding complications during cardiac surgery are needed. Objective To investigate if noradrenaline (NA) enhances platelet aggregation in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Patients/Methods Twenty-four patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) were included in a prospective parallel-group randomized study. All patients but one were treated with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). In the treatment group (n = 12), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) was maintained at pre-induction levels by NA infusion. In the control group (n = 12), NA was administered only if MAP decreased below 60 mmHg. Platelet aggregation (impedance aggregometry with ADP, arachidonic acid [AA] and thrombin-receptor activating peptide [TRAP] as initiators) and clot formation (clotting time, clot formation time and maximum clot firmness by EXTEM, INTEM and FIBTEM tests with thromboelastometry) were assessed before and 50 min after anesthesia induction (before cardiopulmonary bypass was initiated). Results All patients in the treatment group received NA (median dose after 50 min 0.09 (range 0-0.26) μg kg-1 min-1 ). Four patients in the control group also received NA (0.03-0.12 μg kg-1 min-1 ). There were differences between the treatment group and the control group in ADP- and AA-induced aggregation changes (ADP, +16 [25th-75th percentiles, 5-26] vs. -7 [-19 to -1] U; AA, +12 [-4 to 16] vs. -9 [-13 to 1] U). INTEM maximum clot firmness increased in the treatment group but not in the control group.

This study aimed to investigate the impact of heparin use during endovascular therapy of anterior circulation tandem occlusions on the functional and safety outcomes. METHODS A retrospective analysis of the multicenter observational TITAN registry was performed. Patients with anterior circulation tandem occlusion and treated with endovascular therapy (EVT) were included, with or without extracranial carotid intervention. We divided patients into two groups based on periprocedural heparin use (heparin vs. non-heparin). The dose of intravenous unfractionated heparin ranged from 1500 to 2500 I.U. Primary study endpoint was 90-day Modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Secondary study endpoint included angiographic and safety endpoints such as hemorrhagic complications. A propensity-score-matched analysis was performed. RESULTS Among 369 patients, heparin was used in 68 patients (18.4%). In the propensity-score-matched cohort, favorable outcome (mRS 0-2) occurred in 51.3% in heparin group and 58.0% in non-heparin group (matched OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.32-1.78; P = 0.52). Similar result was found in propensity-score-adjusted cohort (adjusted OR, 0.72; 95%CI, 0.39-1.32; P = 0.28). Likewise, there was no difference in the rate of successful reperfusion (mTICI 2b-3) (propensity-score-adjusted OR, 1.03; 95%CI, 0.50-2.09; P = 0.93) neither in safety endpoints between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS Periprocedural heparin use during EVT of anterior circulation tandem occlusions was not associated with better functional, angiographic or safety outcomes. These findings are applicable for low doses of heparin, and further studies are warranted.",ez7h89ta

METHODS In this retrospective monocentric observational study, we included 95 patients treated for ilio-femoral PTVLs. We proposed a four-grade scale evaluating the severity of PTVLS caudal to the common femoral vein based on CT phlebography and per-operative phlebography. For most patients, venous patency was assessed with color duplex ultrasonography and the clinical efficacy of the intervention using the Villalta and CIVIQ scores. RESULTS Recanalization was successful in 100% of patients with a morbidity rate of 4%. After a mean follow-up of 21 months, the overall primary patency was 75%, the assisted primary patency 82%, and the secondary patency 93%. Secondary patency was 100% for grade 0-1, 90% for grade 2, and 63% for grade 3 (p < 0.002). There was no correlation between the extension of stenting caudally of the common femoral vein and venous patency. The mean improvements in the Villalta and CIVIQ-20 scores were, respectively, 4.6 (p < 0.0001) and 18 (p < 0.0001); scores were not correlated with the grade of PTVLs in the thigh. CONCLUSION Venous patency after endovascular treatment of ilio-femoral PTVLs was strongly linked to the severity of PTVLs caudal to the common femoral vein but not to the extent of stenting.",yo1wdyrl

The standard preventive treatment in these patients is usually acetylsalicylic acid. AIM The Randomized, double-blind, Evaluation in secondary Stroke Prevention comparing the EfficaCy and safety of the oral Thrombin inhibitor dabigatran etexilate vs. acetylsalicylic acid in patients with Embolic Stroke of Undetermined Source (RE-SPECT ESUS) is designed to determine whether the oral thrombin inhibitor dabigatran, taken within three-months after embolic stroke of undetermined source, is superior to acetylsalicylic acid for prevention of recurrent stroke and to characterize the safety of dabigatran in this setting. DESIGN Prospective, randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial in approximately 6000 patients and 550 centers with embolic stroke of undetermined source. Subjects are randomized to dabigatran or acetylsalicylic acid and treated for an expected minimum of six-months and up to approximately three-years. It is an event-driven trial aiming for 353 adjudicated primary outcome events. STUDY OUTCOMES The primary efficacy outcome is time to first recurrent stroke (ischemic, hemorrhagic, or unspecified). Key secondary outcomes are time to first ischemic stroke and time to first occurrence in the composite outcome of nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular death. The primary safety outcome is major hemorrhage, including symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. DISCUSSION Acetylsalicylic acid is the most common antithrombotic given to patients with embolic strokes of undetermined source to reduce recurrence risk.

Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and venography were performed over the iliofemoral segments before and after treatment. Cross-sectional vessel and lumen diameters were measured from the IVUS scans and the post-procedure anteroposterior and lateral venograms at 3 points (proximal, mid-section, and distal) along each iliofemoral vein by 2 independent observers blinded to the treatment method. Volumes of the recanalized segments were calculated and compared to volumes of the original venous segments to assess clot lysis with each PMT device. IVUS scans and venograms were also compared for their ability to identify residual lesions or clot in need of treatment. Repeatability between and among observers was analyzed using the Bland and Altman method. RESULTS All procedures were successfully completed; there were only 2 minor bleeding complications. The mean volume of the recanalized segment was 2255+/-66 mm(3) by IVUS, representing 80% lysis of the clot compared to what was perceived as >90% lysis with venography (p<0.05). IVUS was able to delineate significant residual thrombus, stenosis, or May-Thurner anatomy requiring ancillary interventions in 100% of patients versus 48% (16/33) on the venograms (p<0.01). Quantitative assessments of the diameters of the involved venous segments from the venograms and IVUS were consistent between and among observers. Comparing the similar patient subgroups, AngioJet resulted in greater clot lysis (88%) versus the Trellis device (72%; p<0.01), corresponding to recanalized venous segment volumes of 2486+/-74 and 2025+/-57 mm(3) and total venous segment volumes of 2826+/-84 and 2813+/-79 mm(3), respectively.

Our goal was to study the evolution of flow-diverter endothelialization and thrombus organization at different time points after flow-diverter treatment in giant fusiform aneurysms to better understand reasons for flow-diverter thrombosis and delayed aneurysm ruptures. MATERIALS AND METHODS Two giant anterior and 2 posterior circulation aneurysms, all of which had partially thrombosed before treatment, were studied. An unruptured, untreated posterior circulation aneurysm was used as a control. Each specimen was removed at 7 days or at 6, 9, or 13 months after flow-diverter treatment. The 3 patients who survived longer than 7 days were followed up by angiography and MR imaging. Formaldehyde-fixed paraffin-embedded sections were stained by using H&E, Van Gieson elastic, CD34, h-Caldesmon, and Picrosirius stains and studied by light microscopy. RESULTS According to angiography, aneurysms were found to be obliterated partially at 6 and 9 months and completely at 13 months. MR imaging revealed that mass effect remained unchanged in each case. Sections of the flow diverter within the normal parent artery were covered by an endothelialized fibrous layer as early as 6 months, but there was no tissue coverage or endothelialization seen even at 13 months inside the aneurysm itself. Each treated aneurysm had a thin wall with complete lack of smooth muscle cells. No signs of thrombus organization were found at any of the time points studied. CONCLUSIONS Endothelialization of the flow diverter in giant fusiform aneurysms may not occur and thrombus organization may not be initiated inside these aneurysms for as long as 1 year, which explains delayed flow-diverter thrombosis and the possibility of delayed ruptures.",o75j9nhm

The significance of delayed posttreatment residual flow occurring months after FD treatment is unknown. CASE DESCRIPTION A 76-year-old woman with a large intracranial aneurysm measuring 23.0 × 18.1 mm in the cavernous segment of the right internal carotid artery was treated with placement of a single FD (Pipeline Embolization Device, Covidien, Irvine, California, USA). Postprocedure digital subtraction angiography (DSA) demonstrated flow stagnation inside the aneurysm dome. The patient was discharged 9 days post procedure without new neurologic deficits. A 6-month follow-up DSA demonstrated delayed posttreatment residual flow into the aneurysm sac. Although she was scheduled for additional FD placement because of concern for aneurysmal rupture, the operation was not conducted due to an interim motor vehicle accident. Oral treatment with aspirin (100 mg/day) and clopidogrel (75 mg/day) was continued during her recovery. DSA performed 12 months post procedure showed that the aneurysm had completely thrombosed. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that delayed post-treatment residual flow into an aneurysm may form part of the normal clinical course post FD placement and may not preclude eventual thrombosis of the aneurysm. Larger studies are needed to determine whether more frequent follow-up DSAs after FD placement are necessary and whether all patients exhibiting delayed post-treatment residual flow into an aneurysm require additional FD placement or if watchful waiting is a more suitable course.",v2n9yedv

Clinical parameters, aneurysm characteristics, technical results and short-term outcomes were reviewed. RESULTS Eleven intracranial aneurysms were treated with the FRED in 11 patients. The technical device deployment success rate was 100%. Immediate reduction in intra-aneurysmal flow after deployment was noted in 10 cases. The aneurysm occlusion rate at 6 months was 75%. There was 1 complication of in-stent thrombosis immediately after deployment. There was no side branch occlusion, delayed aneurysm rupture, stroke, or intraparenchymal haemorrhage. There was no neurological deficit, morbidity, or mortality. CONCLUSION The FRED is a new FD. It has shown to be safe and effective in our series. The unique dual-layer design of the device renders it to have technical advantages over other FDs.

Treatment should be considered for symptomatic patients or for those at risk for complications, especially retroperitoneal bleeding which is correlated to tumor size, grade of the angiogenic component and to the presence of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). This study reports our single-center experience with the use of selective arterial embolization (SAE) in the management of symptomatic and asymptomatic renal AMLs. METHODS In this retrospective mono-centric study, all demographic and imaging data, medical records, angiographic features, outpatient charts and follow-up visits of patients who underwent prophylactic or emergency SAE for AMLs between January 2005 and July 2016 were reviewed. Tumor size and treatment outcomes were assessed at baseline and after the procedure during follow-up. Computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or ultrasonography was used to evaluate AML shrinkage. Renal function was measured pre- and post-procedure. RESULTS Twenty-three patients (18 females, 5 males; median age, 45 years; range, 19-85 years) who underwent SAE either to treat bleeding AML (n=6) or as a prophylactic treatment (n=17) were included. Overall, 34 AMLs were embolized. TSC status was confirmed for 6 patients. Immediate technical success rate was 96% and 4 patients benefitted from an additional procedure. Major complications occurred in 3 patients and minor post-embolization syndrome (PES) in 14 patients. The mean AML size reduction rate was 26.2% after a mean follow-up was 20.5 months (range, 0.5-56 months), and only non-TSC status was significantly associated with better shrinkage of tumor (P=0.022). Intralesional aneurysms were significantly more frequent in patients with hemorrhagic presentation (P=0.008). There was no change in mean creatinine level after SAE. CONCLUSIONS SAE is a safe and effective technique to manage renal AMLs as a preventive treatment as well as in emergency setting, with significant reduction in tumor size during follow-up. A multidisciplinary approach remains fundamental, especially for TSC patients. In addition to size, the presence of intralesional aneurysms should be considered in any prophylactic treatment decision.",43qbks58

A new type of bioactive coil, the polyglycolic/polylactic acid-covered platinum microfilaments Nexus coil (ev3/Covidien, Irvine, CA, USA), has been proposed. The objective is to evaluate the safety and short-term and mid-term efficacy of Nexus coils in the endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms. METHODS The ENDECOR (European Nexus Detachable Coil Registry) is the first prospective, consecutive, multicenter non-randomized registry. After providing informed consent, 390 patients (238 women and 152 men; mean age, 51.6 years) with 404 ruptured or unruptured aneurysms were enrolled at 34 centers. Treatment was performed with at least 75 % of coil length as Nexus coils. Clinical and technical complications were systematically reported. An independent core laboratory evaluated angiographic results by using the Raymond Grading Scale. RESULTS Complete occlusion was seen in 181 aneurysms (48 %); neck remnant in 86 aneurysms (22 %) and aneurysm remnant in 111 aneurysms (30 %). Technical and clinical complications related to the procedure occurred in 33 patients (8.5 %). At discharge, overall mortality and permanent-morbidity were 4.1 % (16/390) and 5.6 % (14/251), respectively. Angiographic mean follow-up of 13.3 months was obtained in 233 of 390 patients (64.4 %) harboring 247 aneurysms. Recanalization was observed in 44 aneurysms (17.7 %), and progressive thrombosis was observed in 53 aneurysms (21.6 %). CONCLUSIONS Endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms with Nexus coils was associated with low morbidity and mortality rates. Efficacy of Nexus coils was comparable to published series of intracranial aneurysms treated with bare platinum coils, but their efficacy to prevent aneurysm recanalization was not demonstrated.",krzrboud

Treatment discontinuation rates in vitamin K antagonist (VKA)-treated patients are high but may be lower with non-VKA oral anticoagulant agents. OBJECTIVES The goal of this study was to describe and explore predictors of dabigatran etexilate persistence in patients with newly diagnosed AF over 2 years of follow-up. METHODS Consecutive patients newly diagnosed with AF and ≥1 stroke risk factor were followed up for 2 years. Dabigatran nonpersistence was defined as discontinuation of dabigatran for >30 days. A multivariable Cox regression model included region as well as patient clinical and sociodemographic characteristics to explore predictors of nonpersistence. RESULTS Eligible patients (N = 2,932) took ≥1 dabigatran dose; their mean age was 70.3 ± 10.2 years, and 55.3% were male. The 2-year probability of dabigatran persistence was 69.2%. Approximately 7% switched to a factor Xa inhibitor and 6% to a VKA. Approximately one-third of dabigatran discontinuations were primarily due to serious or nonserious adverse events. Patients from North America had the highest discontinuation risk, and Latin America had the lowest. Minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic AF and permanent AF were associated with a lower risk for dabigatran nonpersistence. Previous proton pump inhibitor use was associated with a higher risk for dabigatran nonpersistence. CONCLUSIONS Probability of treatment persistence with dabigatran after 2 years was approximately 70%. Nearly one-half of the patients who stopped dabigatran switched to another oral anticoagulant agent. Patients from North America, and those with paroxysmal, persistent, or symptomatic AF, may be at a higher risk for discontinuing dabigatran.",9tb9564p

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy and safety of retrievable vena cava filters plus anticoagulation vs anticoagulation alone for preventing pulmonary embolism recurrence in patients presenting with acute pulmonary embolism and a high risk of recurrence. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized, open-label, blinded end point trial (PREPIC2) with 6-month follow-up conducted from August 2006 to January 2013. Hospitalized patients with acute, symptomatic pulmonary embolism associated with lower-limb vein thrombosis and at least 1 criterion for severity were assigned to retrievable inferior vena cava filter implantation plus anticoagulation (filter group; n = 200) or anticoagulation alone with no filter implantation (control group; n = 199). Initial hospitalization with ambulatory follow-up occurred in 17 French centers. INTERVENTIONS Full-dose anticoagulation for at least 6 months in all patients. Insertion of a retrievable inferior vena cava filter in patients randomized to the filter group. Filter retrieval was planned at 3 months from placement. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary efficacy outcome was symptomatic recurrent pulmonary embolism at 3 months. Secondary outcomes were recurrent pulmonary embolism at 6 months, symptomatic deep vein thrombosis, major bleeding, death at 3 and 6 months, and filter complications. RESULTS In the filter group, the filter was successfully inserted in 193 patients and was retrieved as planned in 153 of the 164 patients in whom retrieval was attempted. By 3 months, recurrent pulmonary embolism had occurred in 6 patients (3.0%; all fatal) in the filter group and in 3 patients (1.5%; 2 fatal) in the control group (relative risk with filter, 2.00 [95% CI, 0.51-7.89]; P = .50). Results were similar at 6 months. No difference was observed between the 2 groups regarding the other outcomes. Filter thrombosis occurred in 3 patients. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among hospitalized patients with severe acute pulmonary embolism, the use of a retrievable inferior vena cava filter plus anticoagulation compared with anticoagulation alone did not reduce the risk of symptomatic recurrent pulmonary embolism at 3 months. These findings do not support the use of this type of filter in patients who can be treated with anticoagulation. TRIAL REGISTRATION clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00457158.",otd3j630

Cardiovascular interventions,"Proton Pump Inhibitors, Platelet Reactivity, and Cardiovascular Outcomes After Drug-Eluting Stents in Clopidogrel-Treated Patients: The ADAPT-DES Study."," Certain proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) interfere with clopidogrel metabolism, potentially attenuating P2Y12 receptor inhibition. Previous observational and randomized trials report conflicting results regarding the clinical significance of this pharmacological interaction. We examined the interaction between concomitant administration of PPI and clopidogrel on platelet reactivity and clinical outcomes in the large-scale, prospective Assessment of Dual AntiPlatelet Therapy With Drug-Eluting Stents study. METHODS AND RESULTS On-treatment P2Y12 platelet reactivity testing was performed using the VerifyNow assay after clopidogrel loading and successful drug-eluting stent implantation at 11 sites in the United States and Germany. PPIs were prescribed at the discretion of treating physicians; patients were followed for 2 years. High platelet reactivity was defined as P2Y12 reactivity units >208. Of 8582 enrolled patients, 2697 (31.4%) were taking a PPI at the time of coronary intervention. After adjustment for differences in baseline characteristics, PPI use was independently associated with high platelet reactivity (odds ratio, 1.38: 95% confidence interval, 1.25-1.52, P=0.0001). A total of 2162 (25.2%) patients were prescribed a PPI at hospital discharge. In a propensity-adjusted multivariable analysis, discharge PPI use was independently associated with increased risk for postdischarge major adverse cardiac events (cardiac death, myocardial infarction, or ischemia-driven target lesion revascularization) at 2-year follow-up (hazard ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.42, P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS In patients treated with clopidogrel after successful drug-eluting stents implantation, the concomitant administration of PPI was associated with high platelet reactivity and a greater rate of adverse outcomes during long-term follow-up. Additional studies are warranted to determine the risk-benefit ratio of PPIs in patients with drug-eluting stents treated with clopidogrel.

MATERIALS AND METHODS 39 patients (17 women and 22 men) with a total of 125 liver metastases were treated with percutaneous or intraoperative CEUS-guided MW ablation. The primary tumor was colorectal cancer (n = 31), breast cancer (n = 6), carcinoid tumor (n = 1), and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) (n = 1). The median number of metastases ablated in the 45 treatment sessions was 2 (range 1 - 11). The median size (maximum diameter) of the 125 metastases was 1.5 cm (range, 0.6 - 4.0 cm). Nineteen (15 %) of the 125 metastases were bigger than 2 cm. Metastases smaller than 2 cm were treated with a single needle, metastases bigger than 2 cm were treated with 2 or 3 parallel needles. RESULTS The 45 MW ablation sessions were performed percutaneously (n = 30), during laparotomy (n = 3), or during laparotomy combined with liver resection (n = 12). The 39 patients were followed up for at least 4 months with a median duration of 11 months (range, 4 - 20 months). The technical success rate was 100 %. The clinical effectiveness was 100 % with complete coverage of the metastasis by the avascular coagulation zone evaluated on immediate post-ablation CEUS. Local tumor progression (local recurrence) was seen in 12 (9.6 %) of the 125 treated metastases, and affected 10 (26 %) of the 39 patients. One major complication was observed in the form of a liver abscess that easily resolved after percutaneous drainage. Four minor complications were observed: Three cases of pain located at the puncture site and one case of ascites. CEUS was valuable in all phases of ablation including pre-ablation staging and procedure planning, placement of MW needles in the tumor, immediate post-ablation control of coagulation size, and finally in the long term follow-up regime. CONCLUSION CEUS-guided MW ablation of liver metastases is an efficient and safe ablation technique with several advantages compared to other ablation modalities.",253t8e5p

Treatment has changed in recent decades from open surgery to management with flexible endoscopy, resulting in lower morbidity and mortality. The goal of this study was to present the largest series, with the longest follow-up, of patients with Zenker's diverticulum receiving outpatient treatment with flexible endoscopy using a diverticuloscope and Ligasure (Covidien, Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States), a device that allows tissue sealing and coagulation of vessels before cutting the septum between the diverticulum and esophagus. Patients and methods We performed 79 diverticulotomies in 69 patients (65.2 % male, mean age 73.4 years). The mean diverticulum size was 2.8 cm. In three cases with a diverticulum ≤ 1.5 cm, the diverticuloscope could not be placed. Results The technical success was 95.83 % and the clinical success 96.7 %: 84 % of the 56 patients followed for a mean of 34.6 months (24 - 64 months) had no dysphagia. The recurrence rate was 10.4 %, with a good response to a second diverticulotomy at 12 months (IQR: 11.5 - 17) in most cases. The most severe complications were two microperforations, resolved with conservative treatment, and one case of delayed bleeding endoscopically-controlled with a clip. Conclusions Diverticulotomy of the esophageal-diverticular septum with Ligasure is an outpatient endoscopic technique that is simple, effective in the long term and very safe for the treatment of patients with Zenker's diverticulum.

METHODS AND RESULTS Five randomized controlled trials encompassing 10,350 patients were included. Primary efficacy and safety endpoints were all-cause death and major bleeding, respectively. All-cause death at 30 days did not significantly differ with bivalirudin compared to heparin (odds ratio (OR) 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74-1.28; P=0.84). Major bleeding was significantly reduced by bivalirudin compared to heparin (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.40-0.85; P=0.005). Bivalirudin use was associated with non-significantly different rates of 30-day definite stent thrombosis (ST) (OR 1.71, 95% CI 0.84-3.49; P=0.14), albeit with higher rates of acute ST (OR 3.55, 95% CI 1.67-7.56; P=0.001) and non-significantly different rates of subacute ST (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.46-1.61; P=0.64). There were non-significant differences in the 30-day rates of reinfarction (OR 1.47, 95% CI 0.94-2.30; P=0.10) and cardiovascular death (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.56-1.02; P=0.07). There were no significant interactions between bailout versus routine GPI use in the heparin arm for any of the safety or efficacy outcomes (all Pinteraction>0.10). CONCLUSIONS Bivalirudin compared with heparin was associated with comparable 30-day rates of mortality with reduced major bleeding, at the price of an increased risk of acute ST, with non-significant differences in the overall 30-day rates of ST and reinfarction. Intended use of GPI in the heparin arm did not significantly modify the treatment effects of bivalirudin.

Deciding to stop or continue anticoagulant therapy indefinitely after completing 3 to 6 months of initial treatment requires balancing the long-term risk of recurrent VTE if anticoagulation is stopped against the long-term risk of major bleeding if anticoagulation is continued. However, knowledge of the long-term risk for major bleeding events during extended anticoagulation in this patient population is limited. We plan to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to quantify the risk for major bleeding events during extended oral anticoagulation in patients with first unprovoked VTE. METHODS Electronic databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials will be systematically searched with the assistance of an information specialist (from inception to March 1, 2019) to identify randomized controlled trials and prospective cohort studies reporting major bleeding during extended oral anticoagulation in patients with first unprovoked VTE, who have completed at least 3 months of initial anticoagulant therapy. Study selection, risk of bias assessment, and data extraction will be performed independently by at least two investigators. The number of major bleeding events and person-years of follow-up will be used to calculate the rate (events per 100 person-years) with its 95% confidence interval for each study cohort, during clinically relevant time periods of extended anticoagulant therapy. Results will be pooled using random effect meta-analysis. DISCUSSION The planned systematic review and meta-analysis will provide reliable estimates of the risk for major bleeding events during extended anticoagulation. This information will help inform patient prognosis and assist clinicians with balancing the risks and benefits of treatment to guide management of unprovoked VTE.

The Contour device is designed to target the neck of an aneurysm and cause flow disruption within the aneurysm hence promoting thrombosis and neo-endothelialization at the neck. This article presents initial experiences with the Contour. METHODS The prospectively maintained database was retrospectively reviewed to identify patients treated with the Contour device. Demographic data, aneurysm characteristics, clinical result, and clinical and radiological follow-up information were recorded. RESULTS The review identified 3 patients (2 female), with 3 unruptured aneurysms, of average age 67 ± 8.7 years (range 62-77 years). The aneurysms were all located in the anterior circulation including one pericallosal, one at the A1-2 junction and one on the ICA bifurcation. The mean average dome height was 7.6 ± 0.62 mm (range 7.1-8.3 mm), dome width 5.7 ± 2 mm (range 3.5-7.5 mm), and neck width 3.6 ± 0.95 mm (range 2.5-4.2 mm). At follow-up angiography two of the aneurysms were completely occluded and one device had displaced into the aneurysm sac due to inappropriate positioning of the device. Of the patients one had minor stroke during the postoperative period but returned to baseline neurology. All patients were mRS 0 at last follow-up. CONCLUSION The Contour is a promising new aneurysm occlusion device. Further studies with longer term follow-up are required to determine the efficacy of this novel device.",bz6ep8s2

However, the effectiveness and safety of rivaroxaban in the real-world setting, outside of the strict protocols used by randomized clinical trials, are unknown. METHODS This was a prospective, observational, noninterventional, phase IV study of 3914 consecutive patients who underwent total joint arthroplasty from June 2010 to December 2012. Patients were treated with rivaroxaban 10 mg by mouth daily starting postoperative day 1 and continued for 15 days. Participants were followed up in clinic at 6 weeks and contacted by telephone at 12 weeks. The primary outcome of interest was symptomatic venous thromboembolism; secondary outcomes included bleeding events, transfusion requirements, and death. RESULTS The incidence of symptomatic deep venous thrombosis at 3 months was 0.5% (n = 18). Only 1 deep venous thrombosis event occurred within 7 days of surgery. The incidence of symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE) at 3 months was 0.7% (n = 28). Thirteen PEs (46%) occurred within 7 days of surgery. The rate of major bleeding while on prophylaxis was 0.1%. Only 5% of patients received a blood transfusion. No deaths were attributed to thromboembolic events. CONCLUSION This prospective, observational, phase IV study demonstrates that rivaroxaban appears to protect patients against symptomatic PE and is not associated with major bleeding events when used in a real-world setting as described.",h3bkcby6

There are no data on the primary use of CDT with argatroban and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) in patients without heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combined administration of argatroban and tPA during CDT for massive DVT in patients without HIT. METHODS Thirty-three patients with massive symptomatic iliac and femoropopliteal DVT underwent CDT with tPA and argatroban within 28 ± 6 h of presentation. The dose of tPA was 0.75-1 mg/h through the infusion port and that of argatroban at 0.3-1 μg/kg/min through the side port of the sheath. The patients were evaluated for the efficacy and safety of CDT and recurrent symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) at a mean follow-up of 22 months. RESULTS There was no bleeding or iatrogenic pulmonary embolism with the CDT regimen we used. Grade III lysis (complete resolution of thrombus on venography) was achieved in 30 patients (91 %). In 3 patients with additional inferior vena cava filter thrombosis, further thrombectomy of the filter was required. No patient developed recurrent VTE.

METHODS The TORPEDO trial was a randomized study to demonstrate superiority of PEVI in the reduction of the VTE and PTS at 6 months; in that trial, 183 patients (103 men; mean age 61 ± 11 years) with symptomatic proximal DVT were randomized to receive PEVI + anticoagulation (n = 91) or anticoagulation alone (n = 92). PEVI consisted of one or more of a combination of thrombectomy, balloon venoplasty, stenting, and/or local low-dose thrombolytic therapy. RESULTS At 6 months, recurrent VTE developed in 2.3% of the PEVI + anticoagulation group vs. 14.8% in the anticoagulation only group (p = 0.003); PTS developed in 3.4% vs. 27.2% (p<0.001), respectively. At a mean follow-up of 30 ± 5 months (range 12-41), 88 patients in the PEVI + anticoagulation group and 81 patients in the anticoagulation only group reached target follow-up.

METHODS A post hoc analysis of the erythropoietin in traumatic brain injury (EPO-TBI) trial that included twice-weekly lower limb ultrasound screening. Venous thrombotic events were defined as ultrasound-proven proximal deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or clinically detected pulmonary embolism (PE). Results are reported as events, percentages or medians and interquartile range (IQR). Cox regression analysis was used to calculate adjusted hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for time to VTE and death. RESULTS Of 603 patients, 119 (19.7%) developed VTE, mostly comprising DVT (102 patients, 16.9%) with a smaller number of PE events (24 patients, 4.0%). Median time to DVT diagnosis was 6 days (IQR 2-11) and to PE diagnosis 6.5 days (IQR 2-16.5). Mechanical prophylaxis (MP) was used in 91% of patients on day 1, 97% of patients on day 3 and 98% of patients on day 7. Pharmacological prophylaxis was given in 5% of patients on day 1, 30% of patients on day 3 and 57% of patients on day 7. Factors associated with time to VTE were age (HR per year 1.02, 95% CI 1.01-1.03), patient weight (HR per kg 1.01, 95% CI 1-1.02) and TBI severity according to the International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials risk of poor outcome (HR per 10% increase 1.12, 95% CI 1.01-1.25). The development of VTE was not associated with mortality (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.51-1.65). CONCLUSIONS Despite mechanical and pharmacological prophylaxis, VTE occurs in one out of every five patients with TBI treated in the ICU. Higher age, greater weight and greater severity of TBI increase the risk. The development of VTE was not associated with excess mortality.",n49mozpm

In this analysis, we examine the effect of PCDT in patients with femoral-popliteal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (without involvement of more proximal veins). PATIENTS AND METHODS Within the ATTRACT trial, 300 patients had DVT involving the femoral vein without involvement of the common femoral or iliac veins and were randomized to receive PCDT with anticoagulation or anticoagulation alone (no PCDT). Patients were followed for 24 months. RESULTS From 6 to 24 months, between the PCDT versus no PCDT arms, there was: no difference in any PTS (Villalta scale ≥ 5: risk ratio [RR] = 0.97; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75-1.24); moderate-or-severe PTS (Villalta scale ≥ 10: RR = 0.93; 95% CI, 0.57-1.52); severity of PTS scores; or general or disease-specific quality of life (p > 0.5 for all comparisons). From baseline to both 10 and 30 days, there was no difference in improvement of leg pain or swelling between treatment arms. From baseline to 10 days, major bleeding occurred in three versus none (p = 0.06) and any bleeding occurred in eight versus two (p = 0.032) PCDT versus no PCDT patients. Over 24 months, recurrent venous thromboembolism occurred in 16 PCDT and 12 no PCDT patients (p = 0.24). CONCLUSION In patients with femoral-popliteal DVT, PCDT did not improve short- or long-term efficacy outcomes, but it increased bleeding. Therefore, PCDT should not be used as initial treatment of femoral-popliteal DVT. (NCT00790335).",8cisp4to

In surgical patients, intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) reduces the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), but no reliable evidence exists about its effectiveness in patients who have had a stroke. We assessed the effectiveness of IPC to reduce the risk of DVT in patients who have had a stroke. METHODS The CLOTS 3 trial is a multicentre parallel group randomised trial assessing IPC in immobile patients (ie, who cannot walk to the toilet without the help of another person) with acute stroke. We enrolled patients from day 0 to day 3 of admission and allocated them via a central randomisation system (ratio 1:1) to receive either IPC or no IPC. A technician who was masked to treatment allocation did a compression duplex ultrasound (CDU) of both legs at 7-10 days and, wherever practical, at 25-30 days after enrolment. Caregivers and patients were not masked to treatment assignment. Patients were followed up for 6 months to determine survival and later symptomatic venous thromboembolism. The primary outcome was a DVT in the proximal veins detected on a screening CDU or any symptomatic DVT in the proximal veins, confirmed on imaging, within 30 days of randomisation. Patients were analysed according to their treatment allocation. TRIAL REGISTRATION ISRCTN93529999. FINDINGS Between Dec 8, 2008, and Sept 6, 2012, 2876 patients were enrolled in 94 centres in the UK. The included patients were broadly representative of immobile stroke patients admitted to hospital and had a median age of 76 years (IQR 67-84). The primary outcome occurred in 122 (8·5%) of 1438 patients allocated IPC and 174 (12·1%) of 1438 patients allocated no IPC; an absolute reduction in risk of 3·6% (95% CI 1·4-5·8). Excluding the 323 patients who died before any primary outcome and 41 without any screening CDU, the adjusted OR for the comparison of 122 of 1267 patients vs 174 of 1245 patients was 0·65 (95% CI 0·51-0·84; p=0·001). Deaths in the treatment period occurred in 156 (11%) patients allocated IPC and 189 (13%) patients allocated no IPC died within the 30 days of treatment period (p=0·057); skin breaks on the legs were reported in 44 (3%) patients allocated IPC and in 20 (1%) patients allocated no IPC (p=0·002); falls with injury were reported in 33 (2%) patients in the IPC group and in 24 (2%) patients in the no-IPC group (p=0·221). INTERPRETATION IPC is an effective method of reducing the risk of DVT and possibly improving survival in a wide variety of patients who are immobile after stroke.

Anticoagulant treatments have demonstrated their efficacy in preventing VTE. However, when the bleeding risk is high, they are contraindicated, and mechanical devices are recommended. To date, mechanical prophylaxis has not been rigorously evaluated in any trials in ICU patients. METHODS In this multicenter, open-label, randomized trial with blinded evaluation of endpoints, we randomly assigned 407 patients with a high risk of bleeding to receive intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) associated with graduated compression stockings (GCS) or GCS alone for 6 days during their ICU stay. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of a VTE between days 1 and 6, including nonfatal symptomatic documented VTE, or death due to a pulmonary embolism, or asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis detected by ultrasonography systematically performed on day 6. RESULTS The primary outcome was assessed in 363 patients (89.2%). By day 6, the incidence of the primary outcome was 5.6% (10 of 179 patients) in the IPC + GCS group and 9.2% (17 of 184 patients) in the GCS group (relative risk 0.60; 95% confidence interval 0.28-1.28; p = 0.19). Tolerance of IPC was poor in only 12 patients (6.0%). No intergroup difference in mortality rate was observed. CONCLUSIONS With the limitation of a low statistical power, our results do not support the superiority of the combination of IPC + GCS compared to GCS alone to prevent VTE in ICU patients at high risk of bleeding.",cupke82n

Statistically significant differences in beliefs were found in all subscales other than in treatment control, general harm, and general overuse. Cluster analysis determined there were 4 distinct clusters of beliefs among patients. Multivariate binary logistic regression found VTE patients were least likely to have poor TTR (OR = 0.49; 95% CI 0.29, 0.77). Patients in the ""cautious of therapy and fearful of illness"" cluster were most likely to have low TTR (OR = 4.75; 95% CI 2.75, 8.77). Conclusion Illness perceptions, medication beliefs and treatment satisfaction were associated with INR control. VTE patients and those who were accepting of both illness and treatment were most likely to have optimal INR control.",zi9l7zyb

We sought to identify risk factors of post-hospital discharge VTE events following colorectal surgery. METHODS The NSQIP database was utilized to examine patients developed VTE after hospital discharge following colorectal surgery during 2005-2013. Multivariate analysis using logistic regression was performed to quantify risk factors of VTE after discharge. RESULTS We evaluated a total of 219,477 patients underwent colorectal resections. The overall incidence of VTE was 2.1 % (4556). 33.8 % (1541) of all VTE events occurred after hospital discharge. The length of postoperative hospitalization had a strong association with post-discharge VTE, with the highest risk in patients who were hospitalized for more than 1 week after operation (AOR 9.08, P < 0.01). Other factors associated with post-discharge VTE included chronic steroid use (AOR 1.81, P < 0.01), stage 4 colorectal cancer (AOR 1.40, P = 0.03), obesity (AOR 1.37, P < 0.01), age >70 (AOR 1.21, P = 0.04), and open surgery (AOR 1.36, P < 0.01). Patients who were hospitalized for more than 1 week after an open colorectal resections had a 12 times higher risk of post-discharge VTE event compared to patients hospitalized less than 4 days after a laparoscopic resection (AOR 12.34, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS VTE is uncommon following colorectal resections; however, a significant proportion occurs after patients are discharged from the hospital (33.8 %). The length of postoperative hospitalization appears to have a strong association with post-discharge VTE. High-risk patients may benefit from continued VTE prophylaxis after discharge.",5089wqdx

The decision to stop anticoagulant therapy (AT) after the initial 3-6 months or to continue AT indefinitely, is primarily governed by the long-term risk of recurrence when treatment is discontinued. This risk however, is not well established, hindering decision making. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will conduct a systematic review and a meta-analysis of studies involving patients diagnosed with a first, symptomatic unprovoked VTE or VTE provoked by minor transient risk factors, who have completed at least 3 months of initial AT; and who were followed-up for standardised time intervals of 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20 years (±3 months) after stopping AT. We will search (from inception to January 2017) MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane library for randomised controlled trials and prospective observational studies. Two reviewers will conduct all screening and data collection independently. The primary outcome of the rate of recurrent VTE at the standardised time intervals will be calculated for each study from the total number of recurrent events and the corresponding number of patient-years of follow-up. We will use a random-effects model to pool study results and report a weighted estimate of the absolute rate of recurrent VTE (events per 100 patient-years) over standardised time intervals of 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20 years after discontinuing anticoagulants. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethical approval is not applicable for this study. Findings from this study will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journal publication as well as relevant national and international conference presentations.

Specific patient populations, such as those with cancer and the critically ill, show elevated risk for VTE, bleeding or both, and significant gaps in VTE prophylaxis and treatment exist in these groups. Objective To present novel insights and consolidated evidence collected from experts, clinical practice guidelines and original studies on the unmet needs in thromboprophylaxis, and on the treatment of VTE in two high-risk patient groups: patients with cancer and the critically ill. Methodology To identify specific unmet needs in the management of VTE, a methodology was designed and implemented that assessed gaps in prophylaxis and treatment of VTE through interviews with 44 experts in the field of thrombosis and haemostasis, and through a review of current guidelines and seminal studies to substantiate the insights provided by the experts. The research findings were then analysed, discussed and consolidated by a multidisciplinary group of experts. Results The gap analysis methodology identified shortcomings in the VTE risk assessment tools, patient stratification approaches for prophylaxis, and the suboptimal use of anticoagulants for primary prophylaxis and treatment. Conclusions Specifically, patients with cancer need better VTE risk assessment tools to tailor primary thromboprophylaxis to tumour types and disease stages, and the potential for drug-drug interactions needs to be considered. In critically ill patients, unfractionated heparin is not advised as a first-line treatment option, and the strength of evidence is increasing for direct oral anticoagulants as a treatment option over low-molecular-weight heparins.",glq726i5

The CLOTS 3 trial aims to determine whether, compared with best medical care, best medical care plus intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) in immobile stroke patients reduces the risk of proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT). METHODS/DESIGN The CLOTS 3 trial is a multicenter, parallel group trial with centralized randomization (minimization) to ensure allocation concealment. The protocol has been published (Trials 2012, 13:26) and is available in full at: http://www.clotstrial.com. Between December 2008 and September 2012, 105 centers in the UK recruited 2,876 immobile stroke patients within the first 3 days of their hospital admission. Patients were allocated to best medical care or best medical care plus IPC. Ultrasonographers performed a compression Doppler ultrasound scan to detect DVT in each treatment group at 7 to 10 days and 25 to 30 days. The primary outcome cluster includes symptomatic or asymptomatic DVT in the popliteal or femoral veins detected on either scan. Patients will be followed up by postal or telephone questionnaire at 6 months from randomization to detect later symptomatic DVT and pulmonary embolism (PE), and to measure functional outcome (Oxford Handicap Scale) and quality of life (EQ-5D-3L). The ultrasonographers performing the scans are blinded to treatment allocation, whereas the patients and caregivers are not. The trial has more than 90% power to detect a 4% absolute difference (12% versus 8%) in risk of the primary outcome and includes a health economic analysis.Follow-up will be completed in April 2013 and the results reported in May 2013.

Objective To understand why the burden is so high, qualitative and quantitative research was carried out to gain insights from experts, guidelines and published studies on the unmet clinical needs and therapeutic strategies in VTE prevention and treatment in three populations identified as being at increased risk of VTE and in whom VTE prevention and treatment were regarded as suboptimal: pregnant women, the elderly and obese patients. Methodology A gap analysis methodology was created to highlight unmet needs in VTE management and to discover the patient populations considered most at risk. A questionnaire was devised to guide qualitative interviews with 44 thrombosis and haemostasis experts, and a review of the literature on VTE in the specific patient groups from 2015 to 2017 was completed. This was followed by a Think Tank meeting where the results from the research were discussed. Results This review highlights the insights gained and examines in detail the unmet needs with regard to VTE risk-assessment tools, biomarkers, patient stratification methods, and anticoagulant and dosing regimens in pregnant women, the elderly and obese patients. Conclusions Specifically, in pregnant women at high risk of VTE, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is the therapy of choice, but it remains unclear how to use anticoagulants when VTE risk is intermediate. In elderly patients, evaluation of the benefit of VTE prophylaxis against the bleeding risk is particularly important, and a head-to-head comparison of efficacy and safety of LMWH versus direct oral anticoagulants is needed. Finally, in obese patients, lack of guidance on anticoagulant dose adjustment to body weight has emerged as a major obstacle in effective prophylaxis and treatment of VTE.",ohk3o23s

This study was undertaken with the aim of determining and improving signs and symptoms of venous disease (measured by venous clinical severity score) and complications (by routine surveillance ultrasound and long-term post-operative follow up) for each treatment strategy. METHODS We performed a retrospective evaluation of prospectively collected data from 979 limbs undergoing procedures for significant varicose veins and venous insufficiency from March 2008 until June 2014 performed at a single tertiary referral hospital. Patient demographics, Clinical Etiology Anatomy and Pathophysiology classification, venous clinical severity scores pre- and post-procedure, treatment chosen, and peri-operative complications were collected; descriptive statistics were calculated and unadjusted surgical outcomes for patients stratified by the procedure performed. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the relationship between procedure type and thrombotic complications after adjusting for patient characteristics, severity of disease, pre-operative anticoagulation, and post-operative compression. RESULT Venous clinical severity scores improved more with radiofrequency ablation + transilluminated powered phlebectomy as compared to radiofrequency ablation alone (3.8 ± 3.4 vs. 3.2 ± 3.1, p = 0.018). Regarding deep venous thrombosis, there was no significant difference between radiofrequency ablation + transilluminated powered phlebectomy vs. radiofrequency ablation alone. There was no statistical difference in asymptomatic endovenous heat-induced thrombosis or infection, although there were slightly more hematomas and cases of asymptomatic superficial thrombophlebitis with combined therapy. On multivariable analysis, only procedure type predicted thrombotic complications. CONCLUSION Ablation of axial reflux plus transilluminated powered phlebectomy produces improved outcomes as measured by venous clinical severity score, with slight increases in minor post-operative complications and should be strongly considered as initial therapy when patients present with significant symptomatic varicose veins and superficial venous insufficiency. Implementation of a standardized thromboprophylaxis protocol with individual risk assessment results in few significant thrombotic complications amongst high-risk patients, thus potentially obviating the need for routine post-operative duplex.",tpe3d0y1

Pharmacomechanical catheter-directed thrombolysis (hereafter ""pharmacomechanical thrombolysis"") rapidly removes thrombus and is hypothesized to reduce the risk of the post-thrombotic syndrome. METHODS We randomly assigned 692 patients with acute proximal deep-vein thrombosis to receive either anticoagulation alone (control group) or anticoagulation plus pharmacomechanical thrombolysis (catheter-mediated or device-mediated intrathrombus delivery of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator and thrombus aspiration or maceration, with or without stenting). The primary outcome was development of the post-thrombotic syndrome between 6 and 24 months of follow-up. RESULTS Between 6 and 24 months, there was no significant between-group difference in the percentage of patients with the post-thrombotic syndrome (47% in the pharmacomechanical-thrombolysis group and 48% in the control group; risk ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.82 to 1.11; P=0.56). Pharmacomechanical thrombolysis led to more major bleeding events within 10 days (1.7% vs. 0.3% of patients, P=0.049), but no significant difference in recurrent venous thromboembolism was seen over the 24-month follow-up period (12% in the pharmacomechanical-thrombolysis group and 8% in the control group, P=0.09). Moderate-to-severe post-thrombotic syndrome occurred in 18% of patients in the pharmacomechanical-thrombolysis group versus 24% of those in the control group (risk ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.98; P=0.04). Severity scores for the post-thrombotic syndrome were lower in the pharmacomechanical-thrombolysis group than in the control group at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months of follow-up (P<0.01 for the comparison of the Villalta scores at each time point), but the improvement in quality of life from baseline to 24 months did not differ significantly between the treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS Among patients with acute proximal deep-vein thrombosis, the addition of pharmacomechanical catheter-directed thrombolysis to anticoagulation did not result in a lower risk of the post-thrombotic syndrome but did result in a higher risk of major bleeding.

Deciding to stop or continue anticoagulant therapy indefinitely after completing 3 to 6 months of initial treatment requires balancing the long-term risk of recurrent VTE if anticoagulation is stopped against the long-term risk of major bleeding if anticoagulation is continued. However, knowledge of the long-term risk for major bleeding events during extended anticoagulation in this patient population is limited. We plan to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to quantify the risk for major bleeding events during extended oral anticoagulation in patients with first unprovoked VTE. METHODS Electronic databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials will be systematically searched with the assistance of an information specialist (from inception to March 1, 2019) to identify randomized controlled trials and prospective cohort studies reporting major bleeding during extended oral anticoagulation in patients with first unprovoked VTE, who have completed at least 3 months of initial anticoagulant therapy. Study selection, risk of bias assessment, and data extraction will be performed independently by at least two investigators. The number of major bleeding events and person-years of follow-up will be used to calculate the rate (events per 100 person-years) with its 95% confidence interval for each study cohort, during clinically relevant time periods of extended anticoagulant therapy. Results will be pooled using random effect meta-analysis. DISCUSSION The planned systematic review and meta-analysis will provide reliable estimates of the risk for major bleeding events during extended anticoagulation. This information will help inform patient prognosis and assist clinicians with balancing the risks and benefits of treatment to guide management of unprovoked VTE.

METHODS In this retrospective monocentric observational study, we included 95 patients treated for ilio-femoral PTVLs. We proposed a four-grade scale evaluating the severity of PTVLS caudal to the common femoral vein based on CT phlebography and per-operative phlebography. For most patients, venous patency was assessed with color duplex ultrasonography and the clinical efficacy of the intervention using the Villalta and CIVIQ scores. RESULTS Recanalization was successful in 100% of patients with a morbidity rate of 4%. After a mean follow-up of 21 months, the overall primary patency was 75%, the assisted primary patency 82%, and the secondary patency 93%. Secondary patency was 100% for grade 0-1, 90% for grade 2, and 63% for grade 3 (p < 0.002). There was no correlation between the extension of stenting caudally of the common femoral vein and venous patency. The mean improvements in the Villalta and CIVIQ-20 scores were, respectively, 4.6 (p < 0.0001) and 18 (p < 0.0001); scores were not correlated with the grade of PTVLs in the thigh. CONCLUSION Venous patency after endovascular treatment of ilio-femoral PTVLs was strongly linked to the severity of PTVLs caudal to the common femoral vein but not to the extent of stenting.",yo1wdyrl

METHODS We performed a prospective, multicenter, observational study of 30-day outcomes in consecutive patients undergoing bariatric surgical procedures at 10 clinical sites in the United States from 2005 through 2007. A composite end point of 30-day major adverse outcomes (including death; venous thromboembolism; percutaneous, endoscopic, or operative reintervention; and failure to be discharged from the hospital) was evaluated among patients undergoing first-time bariatric surgery. RESULTS There were 4776 patients who had a first-time bariatric procedure (mean age, 44.5 years; 21.1% men; 10.9% nonwhite; median body-mass index [the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters], 46.5). More than half had at least two coexisting conditions. A Roux-en-Y gastric bypass was performed in 3412 patients (with 87.2% of the procedures performed laparoscopically), and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding was performed in 1198 patients; 166 patients underwent other procedures and were not included in the analysis. The 30-day rate of death among patients who underwent a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding was 0.3%; a total of 4.3% of patients had at least one major adverse outcome. A history of deep-vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolus, a diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea, and impaired functional status were each independently associated with an increased risk of the composite end point. Extreme values of body-mass index were significantly associated with an increased risk of the composite end point, whereas age, sex, race, ethnic group, and other coexisting conditions were not. CONCLUSIONS The overall risk of death and other adverse outcomes after bariatric surgery was low and varied considerably according to patient characteristics. In helping patients make appropriate choices, short-term safety should be considered in conjunction with both the long-term effects of bariatric surgery and the risks associated with being extremely obese.

Venous angioplasty and stent placement has been progressively used to restore and maintain venous patency in PTS patients. This study reports our single-center experience with the use of endovascular treatment for chronic post-thrombotic symptomatic ilio-femoral venous obstructive lesions. METHODS A prospective mono-centric observational cohort study of PTS patients with chronic symptomatic ilio-femoral venous obstructive lesions referred for endovascular treatment was conducted from March 2012 to April 2016. Procedure consisted in recanalization, pre-dilation and self-expandable stenting of stenotic or occluded iliac and/or femoral veins. Severity of PTS, quality-of-life and treatment outcomes were assessed using Villalta scale and Chronic Venous Insufficiency Questionnaire (CIVIQ-20) at baseline and 3 months after the procedure. Imaging follow-up was based on duplex ultrasound (US) and computed tomography (CT). RESULTS Twenty-one patients (11 females, 10 males; median age, 41 years; range, 32-60) were included. Recanalization and stenting was successfully accomplished in all prime procedures, 4 patients benefitted from an additional procedure. Immediate technical success rate was 96% considering 25 procedures, performed without any complications. Median follow-up was 18 months (range, 6-30 months) with a 90.5% stent patency rate. Villalta score significantly decreased from baseline compared with 3 months after the procedure [14 (range, 11-22) and 5 (range, 1-10), respectively, P<0.0001], showing a significant decrease in the severity of PTS. CIVIQ-20 score significantly decreased from baseline compared with 3 months after stenting [48.5 (range, 39-73) and 26.5 (range, 21-45), respectively, P<0.0001] thus showing a significant improvement of quality-of-life. Post-procedural CIVIQ-20 score was significantly associated with Villalta score (95% CI, 1.53-2.95; P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS Our results confirm the high clinical success rate and safety of endovascular PTS treatment and highlight the significant impact of stenting on the quality of life of patients with chronic symptomatic ilio-femoral venous obstructive lesions.",8pbo247t

This is an update of the review first published in 2008. OBJECTIVES The aim of this review was to assess the efficacy of combined intermittent pneumatic leg compression (IPC) and pharmacological prophylaxis versus single modalities in preventing venous thromboembolism. SEARCH METHODS For this update the Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist (CIS) searched the Specialised Register (May 2016). In addition the CIS searched the Cochrane Register of Studies (CENTRAL (2016, Issue 4)). Clinical trials databases were searched for details of ongoing or unpublished studies. SELECTION CRITERIA Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or controlled clinical trials (CCTs) of combined IPC and pharmacological interventions used to prevent VTE. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS We independently selected trials and extracted data. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. We performed fixed-effect model meta-analyses with odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used a random-effects model when there was heterogeneity. MAIN RESULTS We included a total of 22 trials (9137 participants) of which 15 were randomized trials (7762 participants). The overall risk of bias was mostly unclear or high due to selection and performance bias. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence and this was downgraded from high to moderate or very low due to the risk of bias, imprecision or indirectness.The rate of PE in the studies comparing IPC alone with combined IPC and pharmacological prophylaxis was low, underpowering the analyses. The incidence of symptomatic PE was 0.79% with IPC, but ranged between 0.1 to 1% with combined IPC and pharmacological prophylaxis (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.34; 12 studies, 3017 participants, moderate quality evidence). The incidence of DVT was 4.10% in the IPC group and 2.19% in the combined group showing a reduced incidence of DVT in favour of the combined group (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.82; 11 studies, 2934 participants, moderate quality evidence). The addition of an anticoagulant to IPC, however, increased the risk of any bleeding compared to IPC alone; 0.66% (7/1053) in the IPC group and 4.0% (44/1102) in the combined group (OR 5.04, 95% CI 2.36 to 10.77; 7 studies, 2155 participants, moderate quality evidence). Major bleeding followed a similar pattern; 0.1% (1/1053) in the IPC group to 1.5% (17/1102) in the combined group (OR 6.81, 95% CI 1.99 to 23.28; 7 studies, 2155 participants, moderate quality evidence).We detected no difference between the type of surgery subgroups such as orthopedic and non-orthopedic participants for DVT incidence (P = 0.16). Tests for differences between type of surgery subgroups were not possible for PE incidence.Compared with pharmacological prophylaxis alone, the use of combined IPC and pharmacological prophylaxis modalities reduced the incidence of symptomatic PE from 2.92% to 1.20% (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.64; 10 studies, 3544 participants, moderate quality evidence). The incidence of DVT was 6.2% in the pharmacological prophylaxis group and 2.9% in the combined group showing no difference between the combined and pharmacological prophylaxis groups (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.03; 11 studies, 2866 participants, moderate quality evidence). Increased bleeding side effects were not observed for IPC when it was added to anticoagulation (bleeding: OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.30 to 2.14, very low quality evidence; major bleeding: OR 1.21, 95% CI 0.35 to 4.18, very low quality evidence, 3 studies, 244 participants).No difference was detected between the type of surgery subgroups for PE incidence (P = 0.68) or for DVT incidence (P = 0.10). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Moderate quality evidence suggests that combining IPC and pharmacological prophylaxis, compared with IPC or pharmacological prophylaxis alone, decreases the incidence of DVT when compared to compression, and incidence of PE when compared to anticoagulation. Moderate quality evidence suggests that there is no difference between combined and single modalities in the incidence of PE when compared with compression alone and DVT when compared with anticoagulation alone. The quality of evidence for PE or DVT was downgraded to moderate due to imprecision or risk of bias in study methodology, highlighting the need for further research. Moderate quality evidence suggests the addition of pharmacological prophylaxis to IPC, increased the risk of bleeding compared to IPC alone, a side effect not observed for IPC when added to pharmacological prophylaxis (very low quality evidence), as expected for a physical method of thromboprophylaxis. The quality of evidence for bleeding was downgraded to moderate due to indirectness or very low due to risk of bias in study methodology, indirectness and imprecision highlighting the need for further research. Nevertheless, the results of the current review agree with current guideline recommendations, which support the use of combined modalities in hospitalised patients (limited to those with trauma or undergoing surgery) at risk of developing VTE. More studies on the role of combined modalities in VTE prevention are needed.",qy7lkz92

Objective To determine the acceptability of aspirin alone vs anticoagulant prophylaxis for reducing the risk of postoperative VTE in patients undergoing TKA. Design, Setting, and Participants Noninferiority study of a retrospective cohort of TKA cases submitted to the Michigan Arthroplasty Registry Collaborative Quality Initiative at 29 member hospitals, ranging from small community hospitals to large academic and nonacademic medical centers in Michigan. The study included 41 537 patients who underwent primary TKA between April 1, 2013, and October 31, 2015. Clinical events were monitored for 90 days after surgery. Data were analyzed between September and October 2016. Exposures The method of pharmacologic prophylaxis: neither aspirin nor anticoagulants for 668 patients (1.6%), aspirin only for 12 831 patients (30.9%), anticoagulant only (eg, low-molecular-weight heparin, warfarin, and Xa inhibitors) for 22 620 patients (54.5%), and both aspirin/anticoagulant for 5418 patients (13.0%). Most patients were also using intermittent pneumatic compression stockings. Main Outcome and Measures The primary composite outcome was the first occurrence of VTE or death. The noninferiority margin was specified as 0.3. The secondary outcome was bleeding events. Results Of the 41 537 patients, 14 966 were men (36%), and the mean age was 65.8 years. A VTE event occurred in 573 of 41 537 patients (1.38%); 32 of 668 (4.79%) who received no pharmacologic prophylaxis, 149 of 12 831 (1.16%) treated with aspirin alone, 321 of 22 620 (1.42%) with anticoagulation alone, and 71 of 5418 (1.31%) prescribed both aspirin and anticoagulation. Aspirin only was noninferior for the composite VTE outcome compared with those receiving other chemoprophylaxis (adjusted odds ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.68-1.07, P for inferiority = .007). Bleeding occurred in 457 of 41 537 patients (1.10%), 10 of 668 (1.50%) without prophylaxis, 116 of 12 831 (0.90%) in the aspirin group, 258 of 22 620 (1.14%) with anticoagulation, and 73 of 5418 (1.35%) of those receiving both. Aspirin alone was also noninferior for bleeding complications (adjusted odds ratio, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.63-1.00, P for inferiority <.001). Conclusions and Relevance In this study of patients undergoing TKA, aspirin was not inferior to other anticoagulants in the postoperative rate of VTE or death. Aspirin alone may provide similar protection from postoperative VTE compared with other anticoagulation treatments.",wn63lvld

In the setting of intraprocedural or periprocedural embolism, thrombolytics present a potentially useful therapeutic strategy. A series of patients in whom eptifibatide (a platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitor) was used in the treatment of iatrogenic thromboembolic events occurring during elective neuroendovascular procedures is described. METHODS Consecutive cases between May 2009 and July 2011 in which eptifibatide was administered were identified and individually reviewed for inclusion in this study (n=12). All study patients received a uniform, weight based bolus dose of 180 μg/kg of eptifibatide administered either intra-arterially through the guide catheter or intravenously. Eptifibatide infusion (2 μg/kg/min) for 24 h after bolus dose administration was continued at the discretion of the surgeon. Procedural details are described and illustrative cases presented. RESULTS Three major categories of thromboembolic events were isolated in the course of review of study cases: acute focal neurological decline and no radiographic findings of flow limitation (eight patients), radiographic findings with or without symptoms (two patients) and persistent particulate debris during flow reversal as part of a carotid revascularization procedure (two patients). Following eptifibatide administration, no patient experienced hemorrhagic complications, and neurologic improvement to baseline level was noted in 10 of 12 patients. CONCLUSION Eptifibatide may be an effective therapeutic strategy in the event of thromboembolism during elective neuroendovascular procedures.",6i9g68k5

Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and venography were performed over the iliofemoral segments before and after treatment. Cross-sectional vessel and lumen diameters were measured from the IVUS scans and the post-procedure anteroposterior and lateral venograms at 3 points (proximal, mid-section, and distal) along each iliofemoral vein by 2 independent observers blinded to the treatment method. Volumes of the recanalized segments were calculated and compared to volumes of the original venous segments to assess clot lysis with each PMT device. IVUS scans and venograms were also compared for their ability to identify residual lesions or clot in need of treatment. Repeatability between and among observers was analyzed using the Bland and Altman method. RESULTS All procedures were successfully completed; there were only 2 minor bleeding complications. The mean volume of the recanalized segment was 2255+/-66 mm(3) by IVUS, representing 80% lysis of the clot compared to what was perceived as >90% lysis with venography (p<0.05). IVUS was able to delineate significant residual thrombus, stenosis, or May-Thurner anatomy requiring ancillary interventions in 100% of patients versus 48% (16/33) on the venograms (p<0.01). Quantitative assessments of the diameters of the involved venous segments from the venograms and IVUS were consistent between and among observers. Comparing the similar patient subgroups, AngioJet resulted in greater clot lysis (88%) versus the Trellis device (72%; p<0.01), corresponding to recanalized venous segment volumes of 2486+/-74 and 2025+/-57 mm(3) and total venous segment volumes of 2826+/-84 and 2813+/-79 mm(3), respectively. CONCLUSION IVUS is superior to venography for detection of residual thrombus and underlying venous pathology after pharmacomechanical thrombectomy.

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy and safety of retrievable vena cava filters plus anticoagulation vs anticoagulation alone for preventing pulmonary embolism recurrence in patients presenting with acute pulmonary embolism and a high risk of recurrence. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized, open-label, blinded end point trial (PREPIC2) with 6-month follow-up conducted from August 2006 to January 2013. Hospitalized patients with acute, symptomatic pulmonary embolism associated with lower-limb vein thrombosis and at least 1 criterion for severity were assigned to retrievable inferior vena cava filter implantation plus anticoagulation (filter group; n = 200) or anticoagulation alone with no filter implantation (control group; n = 199). Initial hospitalization with ambulatory follow-up occurred in 17 French centers. INTERVENTIONS Full-dose anticoagulation for at least 6 months in all patients. Insertion of a retrievable inferior vena cava filter in patients randomized to the filter group. Filter retrieval was planned at 3 months from placement. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary efficacy outcome was symptomatic recurrent pulmonary embolism at 3 months. Secondary outcomes were recurrent pulmonary embolism at 6 months, symptomatic deep vein thrombosis, major bleeding, death at 3 and 6 months, and filter complications. RESULTS In the filter group, the filter was successfully inserted in 193 patients and was retrieved as planned in 153 of the 164 patients in whom retrieval was attempted. By 3 months, recurrent pulmonary embolism had occurred in 6 patients (3.0%; all fatal) in the filter group and in 3 patients (1.5%; 2 fatal) in the control group (relative risk with filter, 2.00 [95% CI, 0.51-7.89]; P = .50). Results were similar at 6 months. No difference was observed between the 2 groups regarding the other outcomes. Filter thrombosis occurred in 3 patients. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among hospitalized patients with severe acute pulmonary embolism, the use of a retrievable inferior vena cava filter plus anticoagulation compared with anticoagulation alone did not reduce the risk of symptomatic recurrent pulmonary embolism at 3 months. These findings do not support the use of this type of filter in patients who can be treated with anticoagulation. TRIAL REGISTRATION clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00457158.",otd3j630

We report our institution's experience treating AT-IVC using endovascular methods. METHODS A 10-year retrospective review of patients presenting with symptomatic IVC thrombosis between the years 2005 and 2014 was performed. Demographic data, treatment modalities, and outcomes were reviewed. RESULTS Twenty-five patients (44% men) underwent treatment for acute (<2 weeks) symptomatic IVC thrombosis. Presenting symptoms included pain and limb swelling in 23 (92%), motor dysfunction in 16 (64%), sensory loss in 14 (56%), and pulmonary embolism (PE) in 2 (8%) patients. Phlegmasia cerulea dolens was present in 5 patients, a history of malignancy was identified in 7 patients, and 21 patients had an IVC filter at presentation (Trapease 12, G2X 3, Option 2, Eclipse 2, Meridian 2). Four patients had a documented hypercoagulable state, 21 patients underwent venous angioplasty, and 7 (28%) patients underwent venous stenting of the IVC or iliofemoral veins. Significant (>50% luminal gain) angiographic resolution of venous thrombus was achieved in all 25 patients. Twenty-one (84%) patients reported moderate-to-complete symptomatic improvement immediately after completion of the procedures. Two patients had a clinically symptomatic PE and 1 patient underwent an above-knee amputation secondary to venous gangrene. Other complications included 6 minor bleeding complications (2 local hematoma, 4 hematuria) all of which resolved spontaneously. There were 2 major bleeding complications (1 disseminated intravascular coagulation, 1 retroperitoneal hematoma). CONCLUSIONS Endovascular treatment of AT-IVC, regardless of etiology, is safe and effective with excellent short-term clinical results. An aggressive endovascular approach to treatment of AT-IVC is warranted even in the presence of a thrombosed vena cava filter.",1ayspy8e

Early restoration of venous patency and preservation of valvular function by endovascular surgery has been advocated. The aim of this study was to review the efficacy and safety of percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy (PMT) against catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) in the treatment of acute iliofemoral DVT. METHODS Three hundred sixty-nine articles were identified through screening of the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases from January 2006 to December 2016. RESULTS Fifteen retrospective studies and one prospective registry, totalling 1170 patients, were recruited for qualitative synthesis. The venous patency rate ranged from 75% to 100% with mean follow-up of 12.3 months. The rates of PTS and recurrent DVT were less than 17% and 15%, respectively. The overall mortality rate was 0.26%. Compared with CDT, PMT was shown to reduce PTS at 1 year (Villalta score: 2.1 ± 3.0 in the PMT group and 5.1 ± 4.1 in the CDT group, P=0.03) and bleeding complications (packed cells transfused: 0.2 ± 0.3 units in the pharmacomechanical thrombectomy group and 1.2 ± 0.7 units in the CDT group, P<0.05). CONCLUSION Percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy is a safe and effective treatment for acute iliofemoral DVT in terms of restoration of venous patency, prevention of DVT recurrence, and PTS. Compared with CDT alone, PMT offers a lower risk of PTS and bleeding complications.",we82ko10

Deep venous system involvement and septic dural sinus thrombosis have a higher mortality rate. In acute occlusion, collateral flow may not be established, which may result in significant edema and mass effect. Endovascular interventions may be considered as a treatment option in appropriate high-risk patients with DVST. MATERIALS AND METHODS Eight patients with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-confirmed dural sinus thrombosis, who did not respond to the conventional standard medical treatment, were subsequently treated with mechanical thrombectomy using the Penumbra System®. In all cases, medical treatment including anticoagulants were continued following the procedure for a minimum period of 1 year. RESULTS Recanalization of the dural sinus thrombosis was achieved in all 8 cases. There were no immediate or late endovascular-related complications. One death occurred due to an unrelated medical event. At 6 months, there was notable improvement in the modified Rankin Score (mRS), with 5/8 (62%) patients achieving mRS of 2 or less. The follow-up ranged between 3 months and 26 months (mean: 14.5 months), and there were no new neurological events during the follow-up period. CONCLUSION Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis is a rare but life-threatening condition that demands timely diagnosis and therapy. In cases of rapidly declining neurological status despite standard therapy with systemic anticoagulation and anti-edema measures, mechanical thrombectomy could be a lifesaving and effective option. In this study, good outcomes were observed in the majority of patients at long-term follow up.",m13txu0y

We performed a retrospective review of prospectively collected follow-up data to evaluate the results of catheter-directed thrombolysis at our institution. Method Patients admitted for venous thrombolysis were included in the study and their files screened for information regarding results and technical aspects of treatment and patient status on follow-up. A catheter was inserted under imaging guidance into the thrombosed vein. Through the catheter tissue plasminogen activator was administered. Daily catheter-based venographies were performed to monitor progression in thrombus resolution. After thrombolysis flow-limiting stenosis was stented. Patients started wearing compression stockings and were started on oral anticoagulant therapy. Follow-up visits with ultrasound, magnetic resonance venography and clinical assessment were scheduled at six weeks and three, six, 12 and 24 months. Results A total of 48 patients underwent catheter-directed thrombolysis, including 36 female patients. Median age was 28 years. Complete lysis of the thrombus was achieved in 43 cases and partial lysis in two cases and 26 stents were placed. No deaths or life-threatening bleeding events occurred. Thirty-two of the patients who achieved full lysis and were followed up remained patent at follow-up. At 12 months seven patients had symptoms of post-thrombotic syndrome. Conclusion Catheter-directed thrombolysis represents a safe and effective alternative to systemic anticoagulative treatment of deep venous thrombosis with rapid resolution of the thrombus and few complications. Long-term patency shows good validity and this study suggests that catheter-directed thrombolysis is effective in preventing post-thrombotic syndrome.",zb12ggc9

This report summarizes conclusions of an international multidisciplinary consensus group assembled to address evaluation and treatment of patients with thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS), a group of conditions characterized by extrinsic compression of the neurovascular structures serving the upper extremity. The following recommendations were developed in relation to the 3 defined types of TOS (neurogenic, venous, and arterial) and 3 phases of pandemic response (preparatory, urgent with limited resources, and emergency with complete diversion of resources): (1) In-person evaluation and treatment for neurogenic TOS (interventional or surgical) is generally postponed during all pandemic phases, with telephone/telemedicine visits and at-home physical therapy exercises recommended when feasible. (2) Venous TOS presenting with acute upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (Paget-Schroetter syndrome) is managed primarily with anticoagulation, with percutaneous interventions for venous TOS (thrombolysis) considered in early phases (I and II) and surgical treatment delayed until pandemic conditions resolve. Catheter-based interventions may also be considered for selected patients with central subclavian vein obstruction and threatened hemodialysis access in all pandemic phases, with definitive surgical treatment postponed. (3) Evaluation and surgical treatment for arterial TOS should be reserved for limb-threatening situations, such as acute upper extremity ischemia or acute digital embolization, in all phases of pandemic response. In late pandemic phases surgery should be restricted to thrombolysis or brachial artery thromboembolectomy, with more definitive treatment delayed until pandemic conditions resolve.",eprjumc8

Observational studies to assess clinical outcome and related complications have been published. Clear evidence is required to better understand the safety profile of the WEB device. The authors here present a multicenter series that provides a detailed safety analysis focused on patient selection, procedural events, and technical issues of treated patients throughout the United Kingdom (UK). METHODS A nationwide password-protected database was set up to collect anonymous information across the UK (14 centers). Complications and clinical outcome were analyzed for the initial 109 patients (112 procedures). An independent root cause analysis classified the complications into groups (procedural, disease, device, ancillary device, and other). The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) was used as a marker of clinical outcome. RESULTS Each of the 109 patients had 1 aneurysm suitable for WEB treatment (109 aneurysms). Three patients had 2 procedures, making a total of 112 procedures performed. Eight procedures were abandoned because of access issues; 2 patients went on to have a successful procedure. All 109 patients had a preprocedure and discharge mRS scores recorded. One hundred patients had a recorded mRS score from a > 3-month follow-up. Deployment of the WEB device was successful in 103 (94.5%) of 109 patients and 104 (92.9%) of 112 procedures. One patient had 2 successful WEB procedures on separate occasions. Patients without a successfully implanted WEB device were included in the analysis. Selection analysis showed that the average patient age was 56.5 years among 34 men and 75 women. The percentage of incidental aneurysms was 58.7%, acute 16.5%, symptomatic 18.3%, and recurrent 6.4%. Further results analysis showed that 40 (36.7%) of 109 patients had recorded adverse events, including those unrelated to the WEB device. Events that could be related to the WEB device numbered 17 (15.6%) among the 109 patients. Two patients with device-related complications were symptomatic. Overall, 11 patients (10.1%) had persistent clinical sequelae. Thromboembolism was the most prevalent event, affecting 15.6% of the patients (17 of 109), and 6.4% of the patients (7 of 109) with a thromboembolism were symptomatic. Overall mortality before discharge was 0% and at the > 3-month follow-up was 5% (5 of 100 patients). Morbidity was defined as an mRS score increase to > 2. Overall morbidity at discharge was 1.8% (2 of 109) and at the > 3-month follow-up was 6% (6 of 100). No device-related morbidity or mortality was associated with this group. CONCLUSIONS The UK data show that the WEB device is safe for clinical use. Thromboembolic complication adds a risk that should be minimized with appropriate anticoagulation and correct sizing of the device. There is scope for further evaluation and standardization of an anticoagulation regimen for the WEB device.",wrp0xnvg

Alteplase is a recombinant tissue plasminogen activator that has been used to improve the function of catheters used for RRT in humans. OBJECTIVES To retrospectively review alteplase instillation in dysfunctional catheters used for RRT in dogs and cats. ANIMALS Seventeen dogs and 8 cats receiving RRT for kidney failure. METHODS Medical records of patients in which alteplase was used for RRT catheter dysfunction from 2004 to 2012 were retrospectively reviewed to characterize reasons for use, improvement in function, increase in blood flow, and duration of improvement. RESULTS Alteplase was instilled 43 times in 29 catheters, most commonly because of suspicion that the catheter would not provide sufficient flow on the next treatment (n = 21). The second most common reason was inability to start a dialysis treatment (n = 12). Catheter function improved after alteplase instillation in 34 of 43 treatments (79%). Median blood flow rate increased by 13% (18 mL/min) in the dialysis session after alteplase instillation.

Venous and lymphatic disorders,A two-cohort feasibility study on polyglycolic acid yarn implantation for abolition of saphenous vein reflux.,"OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and safety of a polyglycolic acid (PGA) yarn implant for nonthermal ablation of saphenous vein reflux. METHODS In two consecutive cohort studies (TAHOE I and TAHOE II), the feasibility of abolition of great saphenous vein (GSV) reflux by implantation of a PGA yarn was tested under ultrasound guidance in 51 and 30 patients, respectively. The use of tumescent local anesthesia was not required. Graduated compression stockings and thrombosis prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin were used for 2 weeks after intervention in the first study only. RESULTS Of 81 enrolled patients, 77 (95%) were available at 6-month follow-up. Complete occlusion of the treated GSV was confirmed by duplex ultrasound in all patients except one patient at day 1. In TAHOE II, closure was preserved in a higher percentage of patients at 6 weeks, with 96.4% vs 82.0% in TAHOE I. The 6-month Kaplan-Meier estimated occlusion rates for TAHOE I and TAHOE II were 68% (95% confidence interval [CI], 54%-79%) and 69% (95% CI, 49%-82%), respectively, with an estimated combined occlusion rate of 69% (95% CI, 57%-76%). Kaplan-Meier analysis yielded a combined reflux-free rate of 85% (95% CI, 75%-91%) at 3 months of follow-up and a rate of 81% (95% CI, 71%-88%) at 6 months of follow-up. Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS) improved from a combined mean of 4.6 ± 3.1 at baseline to 2.1 ± 2.2 and 1.6 ± 1.9 at 3 and 6 months, respectively (P < .0001 for 3- and 6-month results). In TAHOE II, four patients with venous ulcers healed at an average of 1.3 months after treatment. CONCLUSIONS First-in-human use of an endovenous PGA yarn implant for occlusion of refluxing GSVs proved to be feasible, with no serious adverse events. However, recanalization was observed during a period of 6 months in 31% of patients.",aiqqmtw5

Symptomatology and treatment approach, however, are largely influenced by venous drainage. OBJECTIVE To propose an updated classification system using venous drainage. METHODS CCFs with posterior/inferior drainage only, posterior/inferior and anterior drainage, anterior drainage only, and retrograde drainage into cortical veins with/without other drainage channels were designated as types 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. CCFs involving a direct connection between the internal carotid artery and cavernous sinus were designated as type 5. This system was retrospectively applied to 29 CCF patients. RESULTS Our proposed classification was significantly associated with symptomatology (P < .001). Type 2 was significantly associated with coexisting ocular/orbital and cavernous symptoms only (P < .001), type 3 with ocular/orbital symptoms only (P < .01), and type 4 demonstrated cortical symptoms with/without ocular/orbital and cavernous symptoms (P < .01), respectively. There was a significant association of our classification system with the endovascular treatment approach (P < .001). Types 1 and 2 were significantly associated with endovascular treatment through the inferior petrosal sinus (P < .01). Type 3 was significantly associated with endovascular treatment through the ophthalmic vein (P < .01) and type 5 with transarterial approach (P < .01), respectively. Types 2 (27.6%) and 3 (34.5%) were most prevalent in this series, whereas type 1 was rare (6.9%), suggesting that some degree of thrombosis is present, with implications for spontaneous resolution. Type 2 CCFs demonstrated a trend toward partial resolution after endovascular treatment (P = .07). CONCLUSION Our proposed classification system is easily applicable in clinical practice and demonstrates correlation with symptomatology, treatment approach, and outcome.",u8vnkr1n

Studies have shown that thrombus resolution with catheter-directed thrombolysis in patients with iliofemoral DVT reduces postthrombotic morbidity, although patients unsuccessfully treated with catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) do not enjoy the same long-term benefit. The purpose of this study is to objectively assess whether the amount of clot reduction at the time of acute therapy correlates with long-term postthrombotic morbidity. METHODS Forty-two patients who underwent catheter-directed and/or pharmacomechanical lysis of iliofemoral DVT were quantitatively evaluated. Patients had their degree of clot lysis quantified and were divided into two main groups for comparison. Group I (n = 33) had >50% clot lysis (mean, 84%) and group II (n = 9) had < or =50% lysis (mean, 42%). At a mean follow-up interval of 14 months, the degree of chronic venous disease was assessed by evaluators blinded to the degree of clot lysis. Evaluation of postthrombotic morbidity was performed using the Villalta scale, and the clinical class of CEAP, and quality-of-life (QOL) was assessed using the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). RESULTS Mean CEAP scores were 0.85 and 3.13 (P = .005), and Villalta scores were 2.38 and 6.25 (P = .009) in group I and group II, respectively. Patient QOL in group I was higher than group II in all parameters. Physical functioning (P = .035), role physical (P = .012), general health (P = .014), vitality (P < .001), and social functioning (P = .012) were all significantly better in group I. Bodily pain (P = .117), role emotional (P = .624), and mental health (P = .096) strongly favored group I patients but did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION Patients with extensive DVT treated with catheter-based interventions to eliminate thrombus suffer relatively little postthrombotic morbidity. The degree of clot lysis directly correlates with long-term outcome. Improved QOL, the Villalta scale, and clinical class of CEAP are linearly correlated with the amount of clot resolution.",cm0mvbd5

Our experience with the two cases reported here has led us to propose guidelines for the treatment of initial PTE in a pediatric hematology unit. Two children with leukemia developed PTE, the first during the relapse for acute lymphoblastic leukemia and the second at the onset of acute promyelocytic leukemia. In both cases, the diagnosis of PTE was based on clinical assessment of sudden acute respiratory failure with positive pulmonary perfusional scintigraphy in spite of a negative chest X-ray. The subintensive supervision consisted of instrumental monitoring with the assistance of an intensive care anesthetist. The clinical monitoring was based on the serial registration of respiratory rate, cardiac rate, SaO(2) and body temperature. The thrombolytic therapy, together with heparin prophylaxis, was successfully administered in the hematology ward without the need for intensive care support (i.e. mechanical ventilation). The success of the treatment was documented by the criterion of a return to the normal cardiorespiratory parameters a few hours after the start of the thrombolytic treatment. Furthermore, a chest CT scan in case 1 and an arteriography in case 2 confirmed the PTE-related hypoperfusion. On the basis of this experience, the authors point out that in the course of acute respiratory failure in leukemic children, the combination of a negative chest X-ray and a positive pulmonary perfusional scintigraphy (compared whenever possible with ventilatory scintigraphy) in the presence of a negative CT scan could be a reliable diagnostic tool for PTE. This pathology should be treated promptly and with specific therapy to avoid progression to a severe, massive PTE.",0rk2o7s4

There are few data concerning the effectiveness of intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) in treating patients with stroke. OBJECTIVES To establish whether or not the application of IPC to the legs of immobile stroke patients reduced their risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). DESIGN Clots in Legs Or sTockings after Stroke (CLOTS) 3 was a multicentre, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial which allocated patients via a central randomisation system to IPC or no IPC. A technician blinded to treatment allocation performed compression duplex ultrasound (CDU) of both legs at 7-10 days and 25-30 days after enrolment. We followed up patients for 6 months to determine survival and later symptomatic VTE. Patients were analysed according to their treatment allocation. SETTING We enrolled 2876 patients in 94 UK hospitals between 8 December 2008 and 6 September 2012. PARTICIPANTS INCLUSION CRITERIA patients admitted to hospital within 3 days of acute stroke and who were immobile on the day of admission (day 0) to day 3. EXCLUSION CRITERIA age < 16 years; subarachnoid haemorrhage; and contra-indications to IPC including dermatitis, leg ulcers, severe oedema, severe peripheral vascular disease and congestive cardiac failure. INTERVENTIONS Participants were allocated to routine care or routine care plus IPC for 30 days, or until earlier discharge or walking independently. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was DVT in popliteal or femoral veins, detected on a screening CDU, or any symptomatic DVT in the proximal veins, confirmed by imaging, within 30 days of randomisation. The secondary outcomes included death, any DVTs, symptomatic DVTs, pulmonary emboli, skin breaks on the legs, falls with injury or fractures and duration of IPC use occurring within 30 days of randomisation and survival, symptomatic VTE, disability (as measured by the Oxford Handicap Scale), quality of life (as measured by the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions 3 Level questionnaire) and length of initial hospital stay measured 6 months after randomisation. RESULTS We allocated 1438 patients to IPC and 1438 to no IPC. The primary outcome occurred in 122 (8.5%) of 1438 patients allocated to IPC and 174 (12.1%) of 1438 patients allocated to no IPC, giving an absolute reduction in risk of 3.6% [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.4% to 5.8%] and a relative risk reduction of 0.69 (95% CI 0.55 to 0.86). After excluding 323 patients who died prior to any primary outcome and 41 who had no screening CDU, the primary outcome occurred in 122 of 1267 IPC participants compared with 174 of 1245 no-IPC participants, giving an adjusted odds ratio of 0.65 (95% CI 0.51 to 0.84; p = 0.001). Secondary outcomes in IPC compared with no-IPC participants were death in the treatment period in 156 (10.8%) versus 189 (13.1%) (p = 0.058); skin breaks in 44 (3.1%) versus 20 (1.4%) (p = 0.002); and falls with injury in 33 (2.3%) versus 24 (1.7%) (p = 0.221). Among patients treated with IPC, there was a statistically significant improvement in survival to 6 months (hazard ratio 0.86, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.99; p = 0.042), but no improvement in disability. The direct cost of preventing a DVT was £1282 per event (95% CI £785 to £3077). CONCLUSIONS IPC is an effective and inexpensive method of reducing the risk of DVT and improving survival in immobile stroke patients. FUTURE RESEARCH Further research should test whether or not IPC improves survival in other groups of high-risk hospitalised medical patients. In addition, research into methods to improve adherence to IPC might increase the benefits of IPC in stroke patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN93529999.

Imaging and pathologic analysis have defined CaW as an intimal variant of fibromuscular dysplasia, which appears as a shelflike lesion on the posterior aspect of the carotid bulb, more specifically at the origin of internal carotid artery. Reported findings of carotid webs in young patients with recurrent ischemic strokes without an otherwise determined cause have raised questions about the mechanism, natural history, and need for intervention. This review addresses the current understanding of CaW and highlights findings that prompt further investigation into this unique vascular entity as a modifiable stroke risk factor. Observations Imaging analysis demonstrates hemodynamic disturbance in the presence of CaWs. The protuberant shelflike structure creates a pocket therein that may subsequently lead to local thrombosis and cerebral embolism. Computed tomographic angiography is an accurate and often used noninvasive diagnostic modality. Although treatment paradigms have not been systematically evaluated, antiplatelet monotherapy may not be sufficient to reduce recurrent ischemic events in the small series of patients with stroke and symptomatic CaWs. Conclusions and Relevance The limited clinical data on CaWs, although complicated by selection bias, suggest an increased prevalence of these vascular entities in cerebral ischemic events among patients younger than 60 years. Imaging suggests CaW to be a possible nidus for cerebral thromboembolism. Physicians should consider CaW as a cause of stroke in younger patients with anterior circulation ischemic strokes of an otherwise undetermined cause. Treatment options in CaWs with ischemic strokes have not been extensively investigated. Multicenter observational studies evaluating the natural history of CaW are warranted.",gw8jx47f

We conducted a retrospective review of patients with upper- and lower-extremity DVT managed with the Trellis thrombectomy system at our center. METHODS All patients with symptomatic DVT who presented to our center between April 2010 and April 2011 who underwent PMT by the Trellis device were included in this retrospective review. RESULTS Twenty-eight patients (mean age, 46.4 ± 21.2 years) presented with symptoms with a mean duration of 1.3 ± 1.8 months. Eighty-six percent had 100% occlusion on admission, while 14.3% had 70%-90% stenosis. The mean lytic dose used was tPA 20.7 ± 12 mg. The mean Trellis treatment time was 25.1 ± 11.5 minutes. Grade 3 lysis was achieved in 23 of 28 patients (85.8%), while grade 2 lysis was achieved in 14.2%. Mean total hospital stay was 2.6 ± 2.7 days. Postprocedure symptom resolution was 100%, and there was no reocclusion in 78.6% of patients at 1 year. At 12 months, the patency rate (primary or secondary) was 80% as determined by Doppler ultrasound. CONCLUSIONS In patients with DVT involving the ilio-femoral and the upper-extremity vessels, the use of the Trellis device was associated with a high technical success rate as well as a satisfactory 12-month patency rate. Moreover, this strategy was associated with reduced lytic dose, shorter treatment time and hospital stay, and no bleeding complications.",z2q815by

METHODS All patients who underwent RFA of the GSV from 1 May 2013 to 30 September 2013 in eight of our vein centers were included. Duplex ultrasound scans (DUSs) were performed prior to treatment on all patients and 2-3 days, and 1 month after procedure. Demographic data, GSV diameters, and other relevant data were recorded. Clinical, Etiologic, Anatomic, Pathologic (CEAP) classification and Venous Clinical Severity Scores (VCSSs) were determined prior to ablation and one month later. Patients who developed endovenous heat induced thrombosis (EHIT) were followed till resolution. RESULTS A total of 205 patients had one cycle treatment (group A) and 204 had two cycle treatment (group B). The two groups were comparable in their demography, CEAP classification, and VCSS scores. The rate of failure of ablation and incidence of EHIT were also not significantly different. The incidence of complications was low, <5% in both groups and all were minor. CONCLUSION Two cycle treatment of the proximal GSV for vein ablation does not improve the success rate of vein closure in the short term, compared to one cycle treatment. It also does not increase the risks of DVT, EHIT, major bleeding, and other complications. However, we do not know at what diameter two cycles may be superior to one cycle.",urgheo10

INDICATION anatomic or pathophysiologic indication includes venous diameter within 2-20 mm, reflux time ≥0.5 seconds and distance from the skin ≥5 mm or subfascial location. Access: it is recommended to access at or above the knee joint for great saphenous vein and above the mid-calf for small saphenous vein. Catheter placement: the catheter tip should be placed 2.0 cm inferior to the saphenofemoral or saphenopopliteal junction. Endovenous heat-induced thrombosis ≥class III should be treated with low-molecular weight heparin. Tumescent solution: the composition of solution can be variable (e.g., 2% lidocaine 20 mL+500 mL normal saline+bicarbonate 2.5 mL with/without epinephrine). Infiltration can be done from each direction. Ablation: two cycles' ablation for the first proximal segment of saphenous vein and the segment with the incompetent perforators is recommended. The other segments should be ablated one time. During RF energy delivery, it is recommended to apply external compression. Concomitant procedure: It is recommended to do simultaneously ambulatory phlebectomy. For sclerotherapy, it is recommended to defer at least 2 weeks. Post-procedural management: post-procedural ambulation is encouraged to reduce the thrombotic complications. Compression stocking should be applied for at least 7 days. Minor daily activity is not limited, but strenuous activities should be avoided for 2 weeks. It is suggested to take showers after 24 hours and tub baths, swimming, or soaking in water after 2 weeks.",6shnmxyf

Endovascular therapy has emerged as an adjunctive therapy in select cases but has been associated with increased hemorrhagic complications. We present our experience with a large single-center cohort of DVST cases treated with current-generation thrombectomy devices. MATERIALS AND METHODS In this retrospective cohort study, a chart review was performed to compare presentations and outcomes of patients treated with anticoagulation alone with those treated with additional interventional therapy, using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at discharge and at 90 days' follow-up. RESULTS A total of 66 patients were included; 37 were treated with anticoagulation alone, and 29 underwent additional interventional therapy. Patients presenting with ICH or infarction had a significantly greater likelihood of disability at the time of discharge (odds ratio [OR] of 64.5 and 45.8, respectively; P < .0001) and at 90 days (OR of 28.4 and 22.8, respectively; P < .0001). Patients presenting with ICH or infarction were more likely to be selected for endovascular therapy (P < .05). Endovascular therapy was typically performed within 24 hours of admission; 9 patients (31%) had post-treatment hemorrhage, with 2 being (6.9%) symptomatic. There were fewer patients with slight disability (mRS score ≤1) in the endovascular group compared with the anticoagulation group at discharge (P = .05), but outcomes were not significantly different at 90 days (P = .19). CONCLUSIONS Despite a higher rate of ICH or infarction at presentation in the endovascular group and an increased risk of postprocedural ICH, both treatment groups had similarly good functional outcomes at 90 days.",d8jv9jag

METHODS A prospective, multicentre series was conducted at 11 interventional centres in Europe to evaluate embolisation of bAVMs with the new liquid embolic agent. Technical conditions, complications, clinical outcome and anatomical results were independently analysed. RESULTS From December 2005 to December 2008, 117 patients (72 male; 45 female, aged 18-75 years) were included. Clinical presentation was mostly haemorrhage (34.2 %) and seizures (28.2 %). Most AVMs were located in the brain hemispheres (85.5 %). AVMs were <3 cm in 52.1 % of patients and ≥ 3 cm in 47.9 %. Morbidity was observed in 6/117 patients (5.1 %), related to haemorrhagic events in 2 cases and non-haemorrhagic complications in 4 cases. Five patients (4.3 %) died in relation to the treatment (bleeding in 4 patients and extensive venous thrombosis in 1). Complete occlusion of the AVM by embolisation alone was obtained in 23.5 % of patients. Complementary treatment was performed in 82.3 % of patients with partial AVM occlusion, mostly radiosurgery. CONCLUSIONS In this prospective, multicentre, European, observational series, the new liquid embolic agent proved to be suitable for BAVM embolisation, with acceptable morbidity and mortality and good efficacy. KEY POINTS • Numerous interventional techniques have been used to embolise brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). • This prospective multicentre study demonstrates the suitability of a liquid embolic agent. • The safety of treatment using Onyx is acceptable. • Such embolisation leads to complete AVM occlusion in 23.5 % of patients.",981lsckw

METHODS In a 1-year period, 461 MS patients (261 women; mean age 45.4 years, range 21-79) with CCSVI underwent endovascular treatment of 1012 venous lesions during 495 procedures [34 (6.9%) reinterventions]. While balloon angioplasty was preferred, 98 stents were implanted in 76 patients for lesion recoil, restenosis, or suboptimal dilation. The procedures were analyzed for incidences of major adverse events (death, major bleeding, or clinical deterioration of MS), access site complications, procedure-related complications, and procedural safety-related variables (fluoroscopy and contrast times). The complication rates were compared to published data for similar endovascular methods. RESULTS There were no deaths, major bleeding events, or clinical deterioration of MS. Access site complications included limited groin hematoma (5, 1.0%); there were no arteriovenous fistulas or puncture site infections. Systemic complications included only rare cardiac arrhythmias (6, 1.2%). Procedure-related complications included vein rupture (2, 0.4%), vein dissection (15, 3.0%), acute in-stent/in-segment thrombosis (8, 1.6%), and acute recoil (1, 0.2%); there was no stent migration or fracture or distal embolization. Mean fluoroscopy time was 22.7 minutes, and mean contrast volume was 136.3 mL. CONCLUSION Endovascular therapy appears to be a safe and reliable method for treating CCSVI. Innovations such as purpose-specific materials and devices are needed, as are case-controlled and randomized data to establish efficacy in ameliorating MS symptoms.",cu0njduq

The objective of this study was to analyze treatment outcomes of this treatment modality. METHODS A retrospective evaluation of prospectively collected data from all patients undergoing TIPP procedure for symptomatic varicose veins during a recent 12-year period was performed. Pertinent patient demographics, disease classification, perioperative complications, quality of life, and treatment outcomes were collected and analyzed. RESULTS A total of 1167 limbs in 1034 patients (mean age, 52.4 years) were treated during the study period. The mean procedure time was 18.4 ± 8.9 minutes (range, 6.0-82.0 minutes). The mean number of incisions for TIPP procedure was 6.3 ± 3.6. All TIPP procedures were technically successful, and no patient required conversion to hook stab phlebectomy. Fifteen (1.5%) patients developed residual or recurrent varicosities, which were treated with sclerotherapy during the follow-up period. Postoperative complications included hematoma at 2 weeks (5.8%), ecchymosis at 2 weeks (32.9%), saphenous neuropathy (0.3%), cellulitis (1.0%), and skin pigmentation (1.9%). There was no postoperative deep vein thrombosis or mortality. CONCLUSIONS Transilluminated powered phlebectomy is an effective method for varicose vein removal and is associated with high clinical success and excellent cosmetic results. Meticulous technical steps are critical in achieving successful outcomes while minimizing complications.

American journal of neuroradiology,The Preventive Effect of Endovascular Treatment for Recurrent Hemorrhage in Patients with Spinal Cord Arteriovenous Malformations.," AND PURPOSE Spinal cord AVMs represent rare and insufficiently studied pathologic entities. Embolization is thought to play an important role in the management of spinal cord AVMs. Factors for recurrent hemorrhage and the impact of endovascular treatment on prevention of recurrent hemorrhage remain to be confirmed. We aimed to assess recurrent hemorrhagic incidence of spinal cord AVMs and its prevention by endovascular treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS We reviewed 80 patients with spinal cord AVMs by spinal cord angiography who had hemorrhage before the first endovascular treatment at New York University Medical Center, Beth Israel Medical Center, or Roosevelt Hospital in New York. We compared the baseline and radiologic characteristics of patients with and without recurrent hemorrhage by the log-rank test and the Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS We observed recurrent hemorrhage in 35 (44%) patients (1/41 patients with endovascular treatment and 34/39 patients without endovascular treatment). The median length of total follow-up was 659 days (interquartile range, 129-2640 days), and the median length from first-to-recurrent hemorrhage was 369 days (interquartile range, 30-1596 days). The log-rank test revealed that endovascular treatment and venous thrombosis reduced recurrent hemorrhage, and associated aneurysm was related to recurrent hemorrhage. Even in multivariate analysis, the endovascular treatment reduced (hazard ratio, 0.027; P < .0001) and associated aneurysm increased (hazard ratio, 3.4; P = .044) the risk of recurrent hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS Endovascular embolization is the first choice of treatment for spinal cord AVMs and is effective in preventing recurrent hemorrhage.",epn65mk7

Current guidelines for CVT management support the initial use of unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin followed by longer-term oral vitamin K antagonist (VKA). There has been increasing, albeit limited, evidence for the use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) as an alternative to VKA. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that compared the safety and efficacy of DOACs to VKA in treating CVT. A comprehensive literature search was carried out in Medline, Embase and Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register using a suitable keyword/MeSH term search strategy. All studies published in English comparing outcomes of patients with CVT treated with DOAC or VKA were included. In total, 6 studies (5 observational studies and 1 randomized clinical trial) comprising 412 patients (age range 16-83 years) were analyzed. DOAC was used in 151 patients, while 261 received VKA. The follow-up period was 3-11 months. The efficacy of DOACs was comparable with VKA in terms of partial or full thrombus recanalization (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.89-1.16) and excellent functional recovery with modified Rankin scale < 2 (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.93-1.13). Patients treated with DOAC developed lower major bleeding events when compared to VKA, although this did not reach statistical significance (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.12-1.59). We provide preliminary evidence to support DOAC as effective and safe alternatives to VKA in CVT treatment. We await the results of upcoming randomized trials to further support our results and validate the use of DOAC.",1q2snv31

METHODS A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library on the following therapies for incompetence of SSVs: surgery, endovenous laser ablation (EVLA), radiofrequency ablation (RFA), ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy (UGFS), steam ablation, and mechanochemical endovenous ablation (MOCA). The search found 49 articles (5 randomized controlled trials, 44 cohort studies) reporting on the different treatment modalities: surgery (n=9), EVLA (n=28), RFA (n=9), UGFS (n=6), and MOCA (n=1). A random-effects model was used to estimate the primary outcome of anatomical success, which was defined as closure of the treated vein on follow-up duplex ultrasound imaging. The estimate is reported with the 95% confidence interval (CI). Secondary outcomes were technical success and major complications [paresthesia and deep vein thrombosis (DVT)], given as the weighted means. RESULTS The pooled anatomical success rate was 58.0% (95% CI 40.9% to 75.0%) for surgery in 798 SSVs, 98.5% (95% CI 97.7% to 99.2%) for EVLA in 2950 SSVs, 97.1% (95% CI 94.3% to 99.9%) for RFA in 386 SSVs, and 63.6% (95% CI 47.1% to 80.1%) for UGFS in 494 SSVs. One study reported results of MOCA, with an anatomical success rate of 94%. Neurologic complications were most frequently reported after surgery (mean 19.6%) and thermal ablation (EVLA: mean 4.8%; RFA: mean 9.7%). Deep venous thrombosis was a rare complication (0% to 1.2%). CONCLUSION Endovenous thermal ablation (EVLA/RFA) should be preferred to surgery and foam sclerotherapy in the treatment of SSV incompetence. Although data on nonthermal techniques in SSV are still sparse, the potential benefits, especially the reduced risk of nerve injury, might be of considerable clinical importance.",zv3601lz

Herein we describe technical aspects of stenting of the IVC in patients with recalcitrant chronic occlusive disease and evaluate its outcomes. METHODS We reviewed all the patients treated in an endovascular fashion for venous disease at our institution from 2005 to 2014 to identify and to include those with IVC stent placement in this study. Clinical characteristics, treatment details, and outcomes data were collected from medical records. Primary end points were technical success, symptom resolution, freedom from reintervention, and patency rate at follow-up. RESULTS Twenty-eight patients (15 men) with a mean age of 48 ± 2.7 years underwent IVC stent placement for 16 occlusions (4 congenital) and 12 high-grade stenoses. Hypercoagulable state was noted in 14 patients, 7 of whom had malignant disease. A previously placed IVC filter was present in 13 patients. Median time from onset of symptoms to presentation was 81 months (3-480 months). Lytic therapy with tissue plasminogen activator (Alteplase) was performed in 12 patients for a median of 2 days (range, 1-3 days). Self-expanding stents (Wallstent; Boston Scientific, Natick, Mass) were used most commonly in the IVC (n = 22) with or without adjunctive use of balloon-expandable stents (Palmaz stent; Cordis, New Brunswick, NJ). Technical success was 100%. At median follow-up of 10 months (range, 0-56 months), thrombotic complications requiring reintervention occurred in four patients at 1, 4, 8, and 37 months. One patient died at 2 weeks secondary to underlying malignant disease. Freedom from reintervention, patency rate, and symptom-free survival rate at 2 years were 84%, 90%, and 80%. CONCLUSIONS Endovascular stenting for chronic occlusive disease of the IVC is safe and effective in the midterm follow-up, with minimal morbidity. Reintervention rate is low, with excellent functional outcomes.",ydt8uefz

Although below-knee stockings are used more often than thigh-length stockings, no reliable evidence indicates that they are as effective as thigh-length stockings. OBJECTIVE To compare the effectiveness of thigh-length stockings with that of below-knee stockings for preventing proximal DVT in immobile, hospitalized patients with stroke. DESIGN Parallel-group trial with centralized randomization (minimization within centers) to ensure allocation concealment. The ultrasonographers who looked for DVT were blinded, but the patients and caregivers were not. (Controlled-trials.com registration number: ISRCTN28163533) SETTING 112 hospitals in 9 countries. PATIENTS 3114 immobile patients hospitalized with acute stroke between January 2002 and May 2009. INTERVENTION 1552 patients received thigh-length stockings and 1562 patients received below-knee stockings to wear while they were in the hospital. MEASUREMENTS Ultrasonographers performed compression duplex ultrasonography in 1406 patients (96% of survivors) in each treatment group between 7 and 10 days after enrollment. They performed a second scan in 643 patients in the thigh-length stockings group and 639 in the below-knee stockings group at about 25 to 30 days. The primary outcome was symptomatic or asymptomatic DVT in the popliteal or femoral veins, detected on either scan. RESULTS Patients were retained in their assigned group for all analyses. The primary outcome occurred in 98 patients (6.3%) who received thigh-length stockings and 138 (8.8%) who received below-knee stockings (absolute difference, 2.5 percentage points [95% CI, 0.7 to 4.4 percentage points]; P = 0.008), an odds reduction of 31% (CI, 9% to 47%). Seventy-five percent of patients in both groups wore the stockings for 30 days or until they were discharged, died, or regained mobility. Skin breaks occurred in 61 patients who received thigh-length stockings (3.9%) and 45 (2.9%) who received below-knee stockings. LIMITATION Blinding was incomplete, 2 scans were not obtained for all enrolled patients, and the trial was stopped before the target accrual was reached. CONCLUSION Proximal DVT occurs more often in patients with stroke who wear below-knee stockings than in those who wear thigh-length stockings.

The study sample included subjects aged ≥ 18 years with a new diagnosis of varicose veins who had received at least one invasive treatment (eg, surgery, endovenous thermal ablation [radiofrequency or laser], or sclerotherapy [liquid or foam]). The adverse events of interest included a coded diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism within 30 days of a claim for invasive treatment. Patients treated between January 1, 2008, and June 30, 2012, were observed for up to 2 years after diagnosis. RESULTS There were 985,632 unique subjects diagnosed with varicose veins; of them, a total of 131,887 subjects met all of the study criteria: 63,033 (47.8%) having multiple therapies; 22,980 (17.4%) having laser ablation; 21,637 (16.4%) having radiofrequency ablation; 12,708 (9.6%) having sclerotherapy; and 11,529 (8.7%) having surgery. The mean age of the sample was 52.8 years, ranging from 51.5 years (surgery cohort) to 54.5 years (radiofrequency ablation cohort); 77% of the sample was female, ranging from 71% (radiofrequency ablation cohort) to 92% (sclerotherapy cohort). The mean time to treatment after diagnosis was 105 days, ranging from 75 days (sclerotherapy cohort) to 116 days (radiofrequency ablation cohort). The diagnosed prevalence (percentage of subjects within each treatment cohort) of DVT was as follows: radiofrequency ablation, 4.4%; multiple therapies--same day, 3.4%; laser ablation, 3.1%; multiple therapies--deferred, 2.6%; surgery, 2.4%; and sclerotherapy, 0.8%. For pulmonary embolism, the diagnosed prevalence was as follows: radiofrequency ablation, surgery, and laser ablation, 0.3% each; and multiple therapies--same day, multiple therapies--deferred, and sclerotherapy, 0.2% each. CONCLUSIONS Thrombotic complications associated with invasive varicose vein treatments in the real-world setting may be higher than what has been reported in clinical trials, particularly in regard to DVT after endovenous thermal ablation therapy. A better understanding of these patterns of adverse events may have an impact on new strategies to safely and effectively manage patients with varicose veins.",5vsae1he

We sought to analyze predictors of UE DVT resolution and hypothesized that anticoagulation will be associated with quicker UE DVT clot resolution and that CA UE DVT's whose catheters are removed will resolve more often than non-CA UE DVT's. METHODS All patients on the surgical intensive care unit service were prospectively followed from January 2008 to May 2010. A standardized DVT prevention protocol was used and screening bilateral UE and lower extremity duplex examinations were obtained within 48 hours of admission and then weekly. Computed tomography angiography for pulmonary embolism was obtained if clinically indicated. Patients with UE DVT were treated according to attending discretion. Data regarding patient demographics and UE DVT characteristics were recorded: DVT location, catheter association, occlusive status, treatment, and resolution. The primary outcome measure was UE DVT resolution before hospital discharge. Interval decrease in size on the subsequent duplex after UE DVT detection was also noted. UE DVTs without a follow-up duplex were excluded from the final analysis. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify independent predictors of UE DVT resolution. RESULTS There were 201 UE DVT's in 129 patients; 123 DVTs had a follow-up duplex and were included. Fifty-four percent of UEDVTs improved on the next duplex, 60% resolved before discharge, and 2% embolized. The internal jugular was the most common site (52%) and 72% were nonocclusive. Sixty-four percent were CAUEDVT's and line removal was associated with more frequent improvement on the next duplex (55% vs. 17%, p = 0.047, mid-P exact). Sixty-eight percent of UEDVTs were treated with some form of anticoagulation, but this was not associated with improved UE DVT resolution (61% vs. 60%). Independent predictors of clot resolution were location in the arm (odds ratio = 4.1 compared with the internal jugular, p = 0.031) and time from clot detection until final duplex (odds ratio =1.052 per day, p = 0.032). CONCLUSION A majority of UE DVT's are CA, more than half resolve before discharge, and 2% embolize. Anticoagulation does not appear to affect outcomes, but line removal does result in a quicker decrease in clot size.",2w3v8ds6

antiphospholipid antibodies. The prevalence is estimated at 40 to 50 cases per 100,000 people. The most common sites of thrombosis are cerebral arteries and deep veins of the lower limbs. People with a definite APS diagnosis have an increased lifetime risk of recurrent thrombotic events. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of antiplatelet or anticoagulant agents, or both, for the secondary prevention of recurrent thrombosis, particularly ischemic stroke, in people with antiphospholipid syndrome. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (February 2017), CENTRAL (last search February 2017), MEDLINE (from 1948 to February 2017), Embase (from 1980 to February 2017), and several ongoing trials registers. We also checked the reference lists of included studies, systematic reviews, and practice guidelines, and we contacted experts in the field. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated any anticoagulant or antiplatelet agent, or both, in the secondary prevention of thrombosis in people diagnosed with APS according to the criteria valid when the study took place. We did not include studies specifically addressing women with obstetrical APS. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Pairs of review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias for the included studies. We resolved any discrepancies through discussion or by consulting a third review author and, in addition, one review author checked all the extracted data. MAIN RESULTS We included five studies involving 419 randomized participants with APS. Only one study was at low risk of bias in all domains. One study was at low risk of bias in all domains for objective outcomes but not for quality of life (measured using the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire). We judged the other three studies to be at unclear or high risk of bias in three or more domains.The duration of intervention ranged from 180 days to a mean of 3.9 years. One study compared rivaroxaban (a novel oral anticoagulant: NOAC) with standard warfarin treatment and reported no thrombotic or major bleeding events, but it was not powered to detect such differences (low-quality evidence). Investigators reported similar rates of clinically relevant non-major bleeding (risk ratio (RR) 1.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.25 to 8.33; moderate-quality evidence) and minor bleeding (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.51 to 2.83) for participants receiving rivaroxaban and the standard vitamin K antagonists (VKA). This study also reported some small benefit with rivaroxaban over the standard VKA treatment in terms of quality of life health state measured at 180 days with the EQ-5D-5L 100 mm visual analogue scale (mean difference (MD) 7 mm, 95% CI 2.01 to 11.99; low-quality evidence) but not measured as health utility (MD 0.04, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.10 [on a scale from 0 to 1]).Two studies compared high dose VKA (warfarin) with moderate/standard intensity VKA and found no differences in the rates of any thrombotic events (RR 2.22, 95% CI 0.79 to 6.23) or major bleeding (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.24 to 2.25) between the groups (low-quality evidence). Minor bleeding analyzed using the RR and any bleeding using the hazard ratio (HR) were more frequent in participants receiving high-intensity warfarin treatment compared to the standard-intensity therapy (RR 2.55, 95% CI 1.07 to 6.07; and HR 2.03, 95% CI 1.12 to 3.68; low-quality evidence).In one study, it was not possible to estimate the RR for stroke with a combination of VKA plus antiplatelet agent compared to a single antiplatelet agent, while for major bleeding, a single event occurred in the single antiplatelet agent group. In one study, comparing combined VKA plus antiplatelet agent with dual antiplatelet therapy, the RR of the risk of stroke over three years of observation was 5.00 (95% CI 0.26 to 98.0). In a single small study, the RR for stroke during one year of observation with a dual antiplatelet therapy compared to single antiplatelet drug was 0.14 (95% CI 0.01 to 2.60). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS There is not enough evidence for or against NOACs or for high-intensity VKA compared to the standard VKA therapy in the secondary prevention of thrombosis in people with APS. There is some evidence of harm for high-intensity VKA regarding minor and any bleeding. The evidence was also not sufficient to show benefit or harm for VKA plus antiplatelet agent or dual antiplatelet therapy compared to a single antiplatelet drug. Future studies should be adequately powered, with proper adherence to treatment, in order to evaluate the effects of anticoagulants, antiplatelets, or both, for secondary thrombosis prevention in APS. We have identified five ongoing trials mainly using NOACs in APS, so increasing experimental efforts are likely to yield additional evidence of clinical relevance in the near future.",e97q89qd

The goal of this update is to discuss current practices concerning antithrombosis prophylaxis and the management of recently developed anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents. The duration of prophylaxis is 1 month for oncological surgery. The recommended doses in bariatric surgery are twice daily injections of low-molecular weight heparin without exceeding a total dose of 10,000 IU/day. Dual antiplatelet therapy is necessary for 6 weeks after placement of bare-metal stents, from 6-12 months for drug-eluting stents, and 12 months after an acute coronary artery syndrome. Abrupt discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy exposes the patient to an increased risk of thrombosis. Data are insufficient to make specific recommendations for antiplatelet therapy in gastrointestinal surgery. For major digestive surgery, prescription of daily aspirin should be discussed case by case. If discontinuation of treatment is absolutely necessary, this should be as short as possible (aspirin: 3 days, ticagrelor and clopidogrel: 5 days, prasugrel: 7 days). The modalities for elective management of new oral anticoagulants are similar to those for classical vitamin K antagonists (VKA) therapy, except that any overlapping with heparin administration must be avoided. In the emergency setting, an algorithm can be proposed depending on the drug, the available coagulation tests and the interval before performing surgery.",9yvtq5ib

DESIGN A consensus committee of 68 international experts representing 30 international organizations was convened. Nominal groups were assembled at key international meetings (for those committee members attending the conference). A formal conflict of interest policy was developed at the onset of the process and enforced throughout. The entire guidelines process was conducted independent of any industry funding. A stand-alone meeting was held for all subgroup heads, co- and vice-chairs, and selected individuals. Teleconferences and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee served as an integral part of the development. METHODS The authors were advised to follow the principles of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system to guide assessment of quality of evidence from high (A) to very low (D) and to determine the strength of recommendations as strong (1) or weak (2). The potential drawbacks of making strong recommendations in the presence of low-quality evidence were emphasized. Some recommendations were ungraded (UG). Recommendations were classified into three groups: 1) those directly targeting severe sepsis; 2) those targeting general care of the critically ill patient and considered high priority in severe sepsis; and 3) pediatric considerations. RESULTS Key recommendations and suggestions, listed by category, include: early quantitative resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 hrs after recognition (1C); blood cultures before antibiotic therapy (1C); imaging studies performed promptly to confirm a potential source of infection (UG); administration of broad-spectrum antimicrobials therapy within 1 hr of recognition of septic shock (1B) and severe sepsis without septic shock (1C) as the goal of therapy; reassessment of antimicrobial therapy daily for de-escalation, when appropriate (1B); infection source control with attention to the balance of risks and benefits of the chosen method within 12 hrs of diagnosis (1C); initial fluid resuscitation with crystalloid (1B) and consideration of the addition of albumin in patients who continue to require substantial amounts of crystalloid to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure (2C) and the avoidance of hetastarch formulations (1C); initial fluid challenge in patients with sepsis-induced tissue hypoperfusion and suspicion of hypovolemia to achieve a minimum of 30 mL/kg of crystalloids (more rapid administration and greater amounts of fluid may be needed in some patients) (1C); fluid challenge technique continued as long as hemodynamic improvement, as based on either dynamic or static variables (UG); norepinephrine as the first-choice vasopressor to maintain mean arterial pressure ≥ 65 mm Hg (1B); epinephrine when an additional agent is needed to maintain adequate blood pressure (2B); vasopressin (0.03 U/min) can be added to norepinephrine to either raise mean arterial pressure to target or to decrease norepinephrine dose but should not be used as the initial vasopressor (UG); dopamine is not recommended except in highly selected circumstances (2C); dobutamine infusion administered or added to vasopressor in the presence of a) myocardial dysfunction as suggested by elevated cardiac filling pressures and low cardiac output, or b) ongoing signs of hypoperfusion despite achieving adequate intravascular volume and adequate mean arterial pressure (1C); avoiding use of intravenous hydrocortisone in adult septic shock patients if adequate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy are able to restore hemodynamic stability (2C); hemoglobin target of 7-9 g/dL in the absence of tissue hypoperfusion, ischemic coronary artery disease, or acute hemorrhage (1B); low tidal volume (1A) and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure (1B) for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); application of at least a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in ARDS (1B); higher rather than lower level of PEEP for patients with sepsis-induced moderate or severe ARDS (2C); recruitment maneuvers in sepsis patients with severe refractory hypoxemia due to ARDS (2C); prone positioning in sepsis-induced ARDS patients with a PaO2/FIO2 ratio of ≤ 100 mm Hg in facilities that have experience with such practices (2C); head-of-bed elevation in mechanically ventilated patients unless contraindicated (1B); a conservative fluid strategy for patients with established ARDS who do not have evidence of tissue hypoperfusion (1C); protocols for weaning and sedation (1A); minimizing use of either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation targeting specific titration endpoints (1B); avoidance of neuromuscular blockers if possible in the septic patient without ARDS (1C); a short course of neuromuscular blocker (no longer than 48 hrs) for patients with early ARDS and a Pao2/Fio2 < 150 mm Hg (2C); a protocolized approach to blood glucose management commencing insulin dosing when two consecutive blood glucose levels are > 180 mg/dL, targeting an upper blood glucose ≤ 180 mg/dL (1A); equivalency of continuous veno-venous hemofiltration or intermittent hemodialysis (2B); prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (1B); use of stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with bleeding risk factors (1B); oral or enteral (if necessary) feedings, as tolerated, rather than either complete fasting or provision of only intravenous glucose within the first 48 hrs after a diagnosis of severe sepsis/septic shock (2C); and addressing goals of care, including treatment plans and end-of-life planning (as appropriate) (1B), as early as feasible, but within 72 hrs of intensive care unit admission (2C). Recommendations specific to pediatric severe sepsis include: therapy with face mask oxygen, high flow nasal cannula oxygen, or nasopharyngeal continuous PEEP in the presence of respiratory distress and hypoxemia (2C), use of physical examination therapeutic endpoints such as capillary refill (2C); for septic shock associated with hypovolemia, the use of crystalloids or albumin to deliver a bolus of 20 mL/kg of crystalloids (or albumin equivalent) over 5 to 10 mins (2C); more common use of inotropes and vasodilators for low cardiac output septic shock associated with elevated systemic vascular resistance (2C); and use of hydrocortisone only in children with suspected or proven ""absolute""' adrenal insufficiency (2C). CONCLUSIONS Strong agreement existed among a large cohort of international experts regarding many level 1 recommendations for the best care of patients with severe sepsis. Although a significant number of aspects of care have relatively weak support, evidence-based recommendations regarding the acute management of sepsis and septic shock are the foundation of improved outcomes for this important group of critically ill patients.",1uwyrst6

This study assesses its efficacy in patients admitted to critical care following cardiovascular surgery and the influence of standard antithrombotic agents routinely used in this specific group. METHODS Consecutive cardiovascular surgery patients treated with post-dilution hemofiltration with RCA were included in this prospective observational study. The primary outcome of the study was CRRT circuit life-span adjusted for reasons other than clotting. The secondary outcome evaluated the influence of standard antithrombotic agents (acetylsalicylic acid [ASA], low molecular weight heparin [LMWH] or fondaparinux as thromboprophylaxis or treatment dose with or without ASA) on filter life. RESULTS Fifty-two patients underwent 193 sessions of CVVH, after exclusion of 15 sessions where unfractionated heparin was administered. The median filter life span was 58 hours. Filter life span was significantly longer in patients receiving therapeutic dose of LMWH or fondaparinux (79 h [2-110]), in comparison to patients treated with prophylactic dose of LMWH or fondaparinux (51 h [7-117], p < 0.001), and patients without antithrombotic prophylaxis (42 h [2-91], p < 0.0001). 12 bleeding episodes were observed; 8 occurred in patients receiving treatment dose anticoagulation, 3 in patients receiving prophylactic dose anticoagulation and 1 in a patient with no antithrombotic prophylaxis. CONCLUSIONS A post dilution hemofiltration with RCA provides prolonged filter life span when adjusted for reasons other than clotting. Patients receiving treatment dose anticoagulation had a significantly longer filter life span than those who were on prophylactic doses or ASA alone.",stmu1j0j

METHODS We searched PubMed until May 31, 2012, for randomized clinical trials using the following search items: atrial fibrillation, anticoagulation, warfarin, and previous stroke or transient ischemic attack. Studies had to be phase III trials in atrial fibrillation patients comparing warfarin with a non-VKA currently on the market or with the intention to be brought to the market in North America or Europe. Analysis was performed on intention-to-treat basis. A fixed-effects model was used as more appropriate than a random-effects model when combining a small number of studies. RESULTS Among 47 potentially eligible articles, 3 were included in the meta-analysis. In 14 527 patients, non-VKAs were associated with a significant reduction of stroke/systemic embolism (odds ratios, 0.85 [95% CI, 074-0.99]; relative risk reduction, 14%; absolute risk reduction, 0.7%; number needed to treat, 134 over 1.8-2.0 years) compared with warfarin. Non-VKAs were also associated with a significant reduction of major bleeding compared with warfarin (odds ratios, 0.86 [95% CI, 075-0.99]; relative risk reduction, 13%; absolute risk reduction, 0.8%; number needed to treat, 125), mainly driven by the significant reduction of hemorrhagic stroke (odds ratios, 0.44 [95% CI, 032-0.62]; relative risk reduction, 57.9%; absolute risk reduction, 0.7%; number needed to treat, 139). CONCLUSIONS In the context of the significant limitations of combining the results of disparate trials of different agents, non-VKAs seem to be associated with a significant reduction in rates of stroke or systemic embolism, hemorrhagic stroke, and major bleeding when compared with warfarin in patients with previous stroke or transient ischemic attack.",avpn7343

Patients were randomized to standard care or standard care + noradrenaline infusion. Low-dose noradrenaline improved intraoperative platelet aggregation and clot formation. Noradrenaline may be considered to improve intraoperative hemostasis during cardiac surgery. SUMMARY: Background New approaches to prevent bleeding complications during cardiac surgery are needed. Objective To investigate if noradrenaline (NA) enhances platelet aggregation in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Patients/Methods Twenty-four patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) were included in a prospective parallel-group randomized study. All patients but one were treated with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). In the treatment group (n = 12), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) was maintained at pre-induction levels by NA infusion. In the control group (n = 12), NA was administered only if MAP decreased below 60 mmHg. Platelet aggregation (impedance aggregometry with ADP, arachidonic acid [AA] and thrombin-receptor activating peptide [TRAP] as initiators) and clot formation (clotting time, clot formation time and maximum clot firmness by EXTEM, INTEM and FIBTEM tests with thromboelastometry) were assessed before and 50 min after anesthesia induction (before cardiopulmonary bypass was initiated). Results All patients in the treatment group received NA (median dose after 50 min 0.09 (range 0-0.26) μg kg-1 min-1 ). Four patients in the control group also received NA (0.03-0.12 μg kg-1 min-1 ). There were differences between the treatment group and the control group in ADP- and AA-induced aggregation changes (ADP, +16 [25th-75th percentiles, 5-26] vs. -7 [-19 to -1] U; AA, +12 [-4 to 16] vs. -9 [-13 to 1] U). INTEM maximum clot firmness increased in the treatment group but not in the control group. Conclusion Infusion of clinically relevant doses of NA enhanced platelet aggregation and clot firmness in ASA-treated CABG patients. NA infusion is hence a potential new method to acutely improve platelet reactivity in patients on antiplatelet therapy undergoing surgery.",3ozef29x

American journal of neuroradiology,Embolization of Intracranial Dural Arteriovenous Fistulas Using PHIL Liquid Embolic Agent in 26 Patients: A Multicenter Study.," AND PURPOSE The introduction of liquid embolic agents has revolutionized endovascular approach to cranial vascular malformations. The aim of the study was to retrospectively assess the efficacy and safety of Precipitating Hydrophobic Injectable Liquid (PHIL), a new nonadhesive liquid embolic agent, in the treatment of patients with cranial dural arteriovenous fistulas. The primary end point was the rate of complete occlusion of dural arteriovenous fistulas. Secondary end points included the incidence of adverse events and clinical status at 3-month follow-up. MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a retrospective multicenter study. Twenty-six consecutive patients with dural arteriovenous fistulas (de novo or previously treated) treated by injection of PHIL only or with PHIL in combination with other embolization products (such as Onyx or detachable coils) were included in the study. Recruitment started in August 2014 and ended in September 2015. RESULTS Twenty-two (85%) patients were treated with PHIL only, with 3 patients treated with both PHIL and Onyx, and 1, with both PHIL and coils. Immediate complete angiographic occlusion was achieved in 20 (77%) patients. Of the 6 patients with residual fistulas, 3 were retreated with PHIL and 1 achieved angiographic cure. An adverse event was seen in 1 patient who developed worsening of preexisting ataxia due to acute thrombosis of the draining vein. CONCLUSIONS PHIL appears to be safe and effective for endovascular treatment of cranial dural arteriovenous fistulas. Short-term angiographic and clinical results are comparable with those of Onyx, with the added advantage of easier preparation and improved homogeneous cast visualization. The use of iodine as a radio-opacifier also produces considerably less artifacts on CT compared with tantalum-based embolic materials.",mqg4pp8e

METHODS On May 28th, 2015, the first patient of imported MERS to China was admitted to Department of Critical Care Medicine of Huizhou Municipal Central Hospital. The clinical features and treatments of this patient were analyzed. RESULTS (1) A 43 years old male of South Korean nationality was admitted with the complaint of back ache for 7 days and fever 2 days with the following characteristics: back ache 7 days ago, without fever or cough or expectoration. He had been suspected to suffer from infection of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( MERS-CoV ) by the Disease Control Department of South Korea, but no specific treatment was given. He had fever for 2 days with maximum body temperature of 39.7 centigrade. He had no chills, cough, expectoration, short of breath, abdominal pain, diarrhea, frequent micturition, or urgency or pain of urination, and no sore throat. The patient had a history of exposure to MERS-CoV patient. He was considered to be a patient of the second batch of South Korean epidemic. (2) Auxiliary examination: 3 copies of throat swab specimens for virus nucleic acid detection were performed by the Disease Prevention Control Center of China ( China CDC ), and they were positive on May 29th, 2015, and also for serum, sputum and stool. Based on the results of whole genome sequence analysis, the virus strains were implicated to be derived from Riyahh and Jeddah regions of Saudi Arabia. On admission, the patient's blood test showed that the white blood cell count was low ( 3.22×10(9)/L ), the proportion of the neutrophils was high ( 0.73 ), and that of the platelet was low ( 81×10(9)/L ). On admission, the patient's chest X-ray showed that a small amount of infiltration in the lung. (3) TREATMENT: a high-flow nasal cannula ( HFNC ) with oxygen concentration of 0.50-0.80 was given, with a flow rate was set at 60 L/min if tolerated. It was changed to a low flow oxygen inhalation nasal cannula on the 20th day, and oxygen treatment was stopped on the 24th day. Ribavirin 2.0 g was given as the first dose, and was switched to 600 mg every 8 h ( q8h ), and it was reduced to 600 mg q12h after 10 days, and extenuated since the 13th day. Ceftriaxone was added on the 4th day with 2.0 g a day , and it was changed to meropenem 2.0 g, q8h on the 7th day for 2 weeks. Gamma globulin was given for 7 days ( 20 g, qd ). Thymosin-α1 was given on the 8th day for 2 weeks. Interferon was given once a week, but only one dose was used. At the same time symptomatic treatment such as methimazole and liver protection therapy were given. (4) Patient began to cough at admission, and it disappeared on the 18th day. There was no sputum at first, then a small amount of sputum with a little blood appeared after the admission. Then there was cough without sputum. Mild shortness of breath and diarrhea after exertion were noticed. He had no chest pain, difficulty in breathing or other symptoms. There was dullness on percussion in both sides of chest, and it disappeared gradually. Fine moist rales were detectable in scapular area and interscapular area on the 5th day, and they disappeared after 3 days. Breath sounds on both sides was weak, and it became more obvious in the right lung after 5 days, and returned to normal after 18 days. He had a sustaining fever for 1 week with the maximum temperature of 39.5 centigrade, then the body temperature returned to normal. The viral nucleic acid test as performed by the Center for Disease Control of Guangdong ( CDC, Guangdong ) showed that the pharyngeal swab cultured turned negative on the 3rd day, that of serum specimens turned negative on the 8th day, that of stool specimen after 2 weeks, and it was persistently positive for sputum culture until 5 days before discharge. The oxygenation index gradually increased, and it was over 300 mmHg ( 1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa ) after 15 days. Pleural effusion was rapidly increased during the first week as shown by chest X-ray films, and it began to be absorbed gradually in the second week, but it was not completely absorbed until discharge. CONCLUSIONS The disease course of the reported patient was short, with an acute onset, with fever as the chief complaint, but there were no respiratory symptoms, though there were high fever, cough, shortness of breath, diarrhea and other clinical symptoms after admission. Virus in sputum disappeared after treatment, but pleural effusion was not completely absorbed. Negative test for virus in sputum was late, indicating that clearance of virus was slow from the lungs. It is the first case of MERS in China, therefore, the clinical manifestations and the treatment strategy need to be further explored.",db45mydq

METHODS Patients with stroke on treatment with a NOAC were prospectively enrolled in this multicentre observational study between February 2012 and 2015. Brain imaging at admission and follow-up imaging until day 7 were reviewed for HT. Functional outcome was assessed by the modified Rankin scale (mRS) before the index event, at discharge, and at 3-months. RESULTS 231 patients without recanalisation therapy (no-RT), and 32 patients with RT were eligible for analysis. Any HT was present at admission in 9/231 no-RT patients (3.9%, 95% CI 2.0 to 7.3) and in none of the patients with RT. In patients with follow-up imaging (no-RT, n=129, and RT, n=32), HT was present in 14.0% (no-RT; 95% CI, 8.9 to 21.1), and 40.6% (RT, 95% CI, 25.5 to 57.8), respectively. After adjustment for stroke severity, this difference between the no-RT and RT groups became non-significant. Symptomatic ICH was observed in 1 patient per group. HT was not associated with unfavourable outcome (mRS 3-6) at 3-months in multivariable analysis. Resumption of OAC after stroke was delayed in patients with HT compared to those without (15 d [IQR, 5-26] vs. 1 d [0-4], P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS The frequency and severity of HT after stroke on NOAC appears similar to previous reports for vitamin K antagonists and no anticoagulation. Whether asymptomatic HT should delay resumption of preventive anticoagulation requires further investigation.",yolk4hx7

This study analyzed the risk factors and management of hemorrhagic complications, such as hemoperitoneum, hemothorax, and hemobilia. METHODS We performed 4133 RFA treatments in 2154 patients with primary and metastatic liver tumors from February 1999 to December 2007. Of these, we enrolled patients with hemorrhagic complications and reviewed their medical records thoroughly. The risk factors for each hemorrhagic complication were analyzed using unconditional logistic regression. RESULTS Hemorrhagic complications occurred in 63 out of 4133 treatments (1.5%), including hemoperitoneum in 29 (0.7%), hemothorax in 14 (0.3%), and hemobilia in 20 (0.5%). Eleven, 8, and 4 of these patients, respectively, were categorized as major complications requiring blood transfusion or drainage. Two patients died after hemoperitoneum. Logistic regression analysis revealed large tumor size [odds ratio (OR) 1.06 per 1 mm increase in diameter] and low platelet count (OR 0.88 per 10,000/microL increase) were significant risk factors for hemoperitoneum. The location of tumor nodules was a significant risk factor for hemothorax (segment 7, OR 2.31) and hemobilia (segment 1, OR 3.30). Other factors, including the number of needle insertions or the duration of ablation, were not significant. CONCLUSIONS Although hemorrhagic complications were relatively rare with percutaneous RFA, specific treatments, such as blood transfusion and drainage, were required in some cases. Care must be taken, especially in high-risk patients.",o692zuj6

This study aimed to investigate the impact of heparin use during endovascular therapy of anterior circulation tandem occlusions on the functional and safety outcomes. METHODS A retrospective analysis of the multicenter observational TITAN registry was performed. Patients with anterior circulation tandem occlusion and treated with endovascular therapy (EVT) were included, with or without extracranial carotid intervention. We divided patients into two groups based on periprocedural heparin use (heparin vs. non-heparin). The dose of intravenous unfractionated heparin ranged from 1500 to 2500 I.U. Primary study endpoint was 90-day Modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Secondary study endpoint included angiographic and safety endpoints such as hemorrhagic complications. A propensity-score-matched analysis was performed. RESULTS Among 369 patients, heparin was used in 68 patients (18.4%). In the propensity-score-matched cohort, favorable outcome (mRS 0-2) occurred in 51.3% in heparin group and 58.0% in non-heparin group (matched OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.32-1.78; P = 0.52). Similar result was found in propensity-score-adjusted cohort (adjusted OR, 0.72; 95%CI, 0.39-1.32; P = 0.28). Likewise, there was no difference in the rate of successful reperfusion (mTICI 2b-3) (propensity-score-adjusted OR, 1.03; 95%CI, 0.50-2.09; P = 0.93) neither in safety endpoints between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS Periprocedural heparin use during EVT of anterior circulation tandem occlusions was not associated with better functional, angiographic or safety outcomes. These findings are applicable for low doses of heparin, and further studies are warranted.",ez7h89ta

PPIs were prescribed at the discretion of treating physicians; patients were followed for 2 years. High platelet reactivity was defined as P2Y12 reactivity units >208. Of 8582 enrolled patients, 2697 (31.4%) were taking a PPI at the time of coronary intervention. After adjustment for differences in baseline characteristics, PPI use was independently associated with high platelet reactivity (odds ratio, 1.38: 95% confidence interval, 1.25-1.52, P=0.0001). A total of 2162 (25.2%) patients were prescribed a PPI at hospital discharge. In a propensity-adjusted multivariable analysis, discharge PPI use was independently associated with increased risk for postdischarge major adverse cardiac events (cardiac death, myocardial infarction, or ischemia-driven target lesion revascularization) at 2-year follow-up (hazard ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.42, P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS In patients treated with clopidogrel after successful drug-eluting stents implantation, the concomitant administration of PPI was associated with high platelet reactivity and a greater rate of adverse outcomes during long-term follow-up. Additional studies are warranted to determine the risk-benefit ratio of PPIs in patients with drug-eluting stents treated with clopidogrel.

MATERIALS AND METHODS 39 patients (17 women and 22 men) with a total of 125 liver metastases were treated with percutaneous or intraoperative CEUS-guided MW ablation. The primary tumor was colorectal cancer (n = 31), breast cancer (n = 6), carcinoid tumor (n = 1), and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) (n = 1). The median number of metastases ablated in the 45 treatment sessions was 2 (range 1 - 11). The median size (maximum diameter) of the 125 metastases was 1.5 cm (range, 0.6 - 4.0 cm). Nineteen (15 %) of the 125 metastases were bigger than 2 cm. Metastases smaller than 2 cm were treated with a single needle, metastases bigger than 2 cm were treated with 2 or 3 parallel needles. RESULTS The 45 MW ablation sessions were performed percutaneously (n = 30), during laparotomy (n = 3), or during laparotomy combined with liver resection (n = 12). The 39 patients were followed up for at least 4 months with a median duration of 11 months (range, 4 - 20 months). The technical success rate was 100 %. The clinical effectiveness was 100 % with complete coverage of the metastasis by the avascular coagulation zone evaluated on immediate post-ablation CEUS. Local tumor progression (local recurrence) was seen in 12 (9.6 %) of the 125 treated metastases, and affected 10 (26 %) of the 39 patients. One major complication was observed in the form of a liver abscess that easily resolved after percutaneous drainage. Four minor complications were observed: Three cases of pain located at the puncture site and one case of ascites. CEUS was valuable in all phases of ablation including pre-ablation staging and procedure planning, placement of MW needles in the tumor, immediate post-ablation control of coagulation size, and finally in the long term follow-up regime. CONCLUSION CEUS-guided MW ablation of liver metastases is an efficient and safe ablation technique with several advantages compared to other ablation modalities.",253t8e5p

The current standard in these patients is acetylsalicylic acid, despite high prevalence of yet undetected paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Aim The ATTICUS randomized trial is designed to determine whether the factor Xa inhibitor apixaban administered within 7 days after embolic stroke of undetermined source, is superior to acetylsalicylic acid for prevention of new ischemic lesions documented by brain magnetic resonance imaging within 12 months after index stroke. Design Prospective, randomized, blinded, parallel-group, open-label, German multicenter phase III trial in approximately 500 patients with embolic stroke of undetermined source. A key inclusion criterion is the presence or the planned implantation of an insertable cardiac monitor. Patients are 1:1 randomized to apixaban or acetylsalicylic acid and treated for a 12-month period. It is an event-driven trial aiming for core-lab adjudicated primary outcome events. Study outcomes The primary outcome is the occurrence of at least one new ischemic lesion identified by axial T2-weighted FLAIR magnetic resonance imaging and/or axial DWI magnetic resonance imaging at 12 months when compared with the baseline magnetic resonance imaging. Key secondary outcomes are the combination of recurrent ischemic strokes, hemorrhagic strokes, systemic embolism; combination of MACE including recurrent stroke, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular death and combination of major and clinically relevant non-major bleeding defined according to ISTH, and change of cognitive function and quality of life (EQ-5D, Stroke Impact Scale). Discussion Embolic stroke of undetermined source is caused by embolic disease and associated with a high risk of recurrent ischemic strokes and clinically silent cerebral ischemic lesions. ATTICUS will investigate the impact of atrial fibrillation detected by insertable cardiac monitor and the effects of early anticoagulation with apixaban compared with antiplatelet therapy with acetylsalicylic acid on the incidence of new ischemic lesion after embolic stroke of undetermined source.",6taai8h0

We sought to compare women and men undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for STEMI in a large, prospective, contemporary context. METHODS The Harmonizing Outcomes with Revascularization and Stents in Acute Myocardial Infarction (HORIZONS-AMI) trial randomized 3,602 patients (23.4% women and 76.6% men) with STEMI presenting within 12 hr of onset of symptoms to bivalirudin or heparin plus glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors and to PCI with drug-eluting or bare metal stents. RESULTS Compared with men, women presented later after symptom onset and were more often treated with medical management alone (6.9% vs. 4.7%; P = 0.01). Women had significantly higher rates of 3-year major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and major bleeding. After adjusting for baseline differences, female sex remained an independent predictor of major bleeding (hazard ratio [HR] 1.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.41-2.33; P < 0.0001) but not of MACE (HR 1.09; 95% CI 0.91-1.32; P = 0.35). CONCLUSIONS This study found that women with STEMI are at increased risk of bleeding as compared to men. While female sex may not directly contribute to increased risk of MACE, it is, however, associated with the presence of comorbidities that increase the risk of ischemic events long-term. Further dedicated studies are needed to confirm these findings and to assess strategies to optimize both the initial emergent treatment and long-term management in this high-risk subset. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",iwy2w2m3

Our goal was to study the evolution of flow-diverter endothelialization and thrombus organization at different time points after flow-diverter treatment in giant fusiform aneurysms to better understand reasons for flow-diverter thrombosis and delayed aneurysm ruptures. MATERIALS AND METHODS Two giant anterior and 2 posterior circulation aneurysms, all of which had partially thrombosed before treatment, were studied. An unruptured, untreated posterior circulation aneurysm was used as a control. Each specimen was removed at 7 days or at 6, 9, or 13 months after flow-diverter treatment. The 3 patients who survived longer than 7 days were followed up by angiography and MR imaging. Formaldehyde-fixed paraffin-embedded sections were stained by using H&E, Van Gieson elastic, CD34, h-Caldesmon, and Picrosirius stains and studied by light microscopy. RESULTS According to angiography, aneurysms were found to be obliterated partially at 6 and 9 months and completely at 13 months. MR imaging revealed that mass effect remained unchanged in each case. Sections of the flow diverter within the normal parent artery were covered by an endothelialized fibrous layer as early as 6 months, but there was no tissue coverage or endothelialization seen even at 13 months inside the aneurysm itself. Each treated aneurysm had a thin wall with complete lack of smooth muscle cells. No signs of thrombus organization were found at any of the time points studied. CONCLUSIONS Endothelialization of the flow diverter in giant fusiform aneurysms may not occur and thrombus organization may not be initiated inside these aneurysms for as long as 1 year, which explains delayed flow-diverter thrombosis and the possibility of delayed ruptures.",o75j9nhm

The significance of delayed posttreatment residual flow occurring months after FD treatment is unknown. CASE DESCRIPTION A 76-year-old woman with a large intracranial aneurysm measuring 23.0 × 18.1 mm in the cavernous segment of the right internal carotid artery was treated with placement of a single FD (Pipeline Embolization Device, Covidien, Irvine, California, USA). Postprocedure digital subtraction angiography (DSA) demonstrated flow stagnation inside the aneurysm dome. The patient was discharged 9 days post procedure without new neurologic deficits. A 6-month follow-up DSA demonstrated delayed posttreatment residual flow into the aneurysm sac. Although she was scheduled for additional FD placement because of concern for aneurysmal rupture, the operation was not conducted due to an interim motor vehicle accident. Oral treatment with aspirin (100 mg/day) and clopidogrel (75 mg/day) was continued during her recovery. DSA performed 12 months post procedure showed that the aneurysm had completely thrombosed. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that delayed post-treatment residual flow into an aneurysm may form part of the normal clinical course post FD placement and may not preclude eventual thrombosis of the aneurysm. Larger studies are needed to determine whether more frequent follow-up DSAs after FD placement are necessary and whether all patients exhibiting delayed post-treatment residual flow into an aneurysm require additional FD placement or if watchful waiting is a more suitable course.",v2n9yedv

Treatment discontinuation rates in vitamin K antagonist (VKA)-treated patients are high but may be lower with non-VKA oral anticoagulant agents. OBJECTIVES The goal of this study was to describe and explore predictors of dabigatran etexilate persistence in patients with newly diagnosed AF over 2 years of follow-up. METHODS Consecutive patients newly diagnosed with AF and ≥1 stroke risk factor were followed up for 2 years. Dabigatran nonpersistence was defined as discontinuation of dabigatran for >30 days. A multivariable Cox regression model included region as well as patient clinical and sociodemographic characteristics to explore predictors of nonpersistence. RESULTS Eligible patients (N = 2,932) took ≥1 dabigatran dose; their mean age was 70.3 ± 10.2 years, and 55.3% were male. The 2-year probability of dabigatran persistence was 69.2%. Approximately 7% switched to a factor Xa inhibitor and 6% to a VKA. Approximately one-third of dabigatran discontinuations were primarily due to serious or nonserious adverse events. Patients from North America had the highest discontinuation risk, and Latin America had the lowest. Minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic AF and permanent AF were associated with a lower risk for dabigatran nonpersistence. Previous proton pump inhibitor use was associated with a higher risk for dabigatran nonpersistence. CONCLUSIONS Probability of treatment persistence with dabigatran after 2 years was approximately 70%. Nearly one-half of the patients who stopped dabigatran switched to another oral anticoagulant agent. Patients from North America, and those with paroxysmal, persistent, or symptomatic AF, may be at a higher risk for discontinuing dabigatran.",9tb9564p

Paclitaxel-eluting balloon (PEB) angioplasty, stenting, and directional atherectomy (DA) have provided new options for the treatment of superficial femoral artery disease; however, the comparative efficacy of these interventional strategies remains uncertain. METHODS One hundred and fifty-five patients with symptomatic peripheral artery disease due to de novo superficial femoral artery stenotic or occlusive lesions were randomized to treatment with plain balloon angioplasty (BA) followed by PEB angioplasty and stenting (n=48), BA and stenting (n=52), or DA with distal protection and bailout stenting (n=55). The primary end point of the study was percentage diameter stenosis after 6 months measured by angiography. Other end points included target lesion revascularization, thrombosis, ipsilateral amputation, binary restenosis, and all-cause mortality at 6 and 24 months. RESULTS Baseline and lesion characteristics were comparable in all groups with a mean lesion length of 65.9±46.8 mm and 56% total occlusions. At 6 months angiography, the percent diameter stenosis was significantly lower in patients treated by PEB angioplasty and stenting (34±31%) as compared with BA angioplasty and stenting (56±29%, P=0.009) or DA (55±29%, P=0.007). Similarly, binary restenosis was significantly lower after treatment with PEB and stenting as compared with BA and stenting or DA. Clinical follow-up at 24 months revealed a lower risk for target lesion revascularization after PEB angioplasty and stenting as compared with BA and stenting or DA. We found no difference in terms of target lesion thrombosis and mortality among groups, and no patient underwent amputation. CONCLUSIONS Treatment of de novo superficial femoral artery lesions with PEB angioplasty and stenting is superior to BA angioplasty and stenting or DA in terms of angiographic diameter stenosis at 6 months and target lesion revascularization at 24 months.

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the mid-term angiographic follow-up of wide-necked aneurysms treated with the Solitaire AB stent. METHODS SOLARE (SOLitaire Aneurysm Remodeling) is a consecutive, prospective study conducted in 7 European centers. A core laboratory evaluated the postoperative and mid-term (6 month ± 15 days) angiographic results by using the Raymond classification Scale. Recanalization was defined as worsening, and progressive thrombosis was defined as improvement in the Raymond scale score. RESULTS The mean width of the aneurysm sac was 7.5 mm, and the mean diameter of the aneurysm neck was 4.7 mm. Angiographic mid-term follow-up was obtained in 55 of 65 aneurysms (85.9%). Complete occlusion was achieved in 33 aneurysms (60%); a neck remnant was seen in 16 aneurysms (29.1%) and an aneurysm remnant in 6 aneurysms (10.9%). Of 55 aneurysms, recanalization was observed in 8 aneurysms (14.5%), and progressive thrombosis was observed in 17 aneurysms (30.9%). No bleeding or rebleeding was observed during the follow-up period. CONCLUSION Stent-assisted coiling of wide-necked intracranial aneurysms was found to be safe and effective with the Solitaire AB stent at 6-month follow-up. Angiographic results improve with time due to progressive thrombosis of the aneurysm.",jzntz4el

American journal of neuroradiology,Risk Factors for Hemorrhagic Complications following Pipeline Embolization Device Treatment of Intracranial Aneurysms: Results from the International Retrospective Study of the Pipeline Embolization Device.," AND PURPOSE Spontaneous intraparenchymal hemorrhage is a dreaded complication of unknown etiology following flow-diversion treatment. Using the International Retrospective Study of the Pipeline Embolization Device registry, we studied demographic, aneurysm, and procedural characteristics associated with intraparenchymal hemorrhage following Pipeline Embolization Device treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS We identified patients in the International Retrospective Study of the Pipeline Embolization Device registry with intraparenchymal hemorrhage unrelated to index aneurysm rupture post-Pipeline Embolization Device treatment. The rate of intraparenchymal hemorrhage was determined by baseline demographics, comorbidities, aneurysm characteristics, and procedural characteristics (including anticoagulation use, platelet testing, number of devices used, sheaths, catheters, and guidewires). Categoric variables were compared with χ(2) testing, and continuous variables were compared with the Student t test. RESULTS Of 793 patients with 906 aneurysms, 20 (2.5%) had intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Fifteen intraparenchymal hemorrhages (75.0%) occurred within 30 days of treatment (median, 5 days; range, 0-150 days). Nine patients with intraparenchymal hemorrhage (45.0%) died, 10 (50.0%) had major neurologic morbidity, and 1 had minor neurologic morbidity (5.0%). Intraparenchymal hemorrhage was ipsilateral to the Pipeline Embolization Device in 16 patients (80%) and contralateral in 3 patients (15.0%). Variables associated with higher odds of intraparenchymal hemorrhage included treatment of ruptured aneurysms (OR, 4.44; 95% CI, 1.65-11.94; P = .005) and the use of ≥ 3 Pipeline Embolization Devices (OR, 4.10; 95% CI, 1.34-12.58; P = .04). The Shuttle sheath was not associated with intraparenchymal hemorrhage (OR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.38-2.45; P = .95). CONCLUSIONS Spontaneous intraparenchymal hemorrhage following Pipeline Embolization Device treatment is a rare-but-devastating complication, with nearly all patients having morbidity or mortality. Variables associated with intraparenchymal hemorrhage included the use of multiple Pipeline Embolization Devices and treatment of ruptured aneurysms. The Shuttle, a device that was previously thought to be associated with intraparenchymal hemorrhage, was not associated with it.",o0e363e1

The aim of this study was to determine whether tailored antiaggregant medication based on platelet reactivity testing with multiple electrode aggregometry (Multiplate) yields superior outcomes after intracranial flow-diverting stent (FDS) implantation compared with standard clopidogrel treatment. METHODS We retrospectively analyzed the following data from 100 consecutive patients: endovascular procedure characteristics, antiaggregant medications, procedural variables, and perioperative complications after FDS implantation for intracranial aneurysm. Patients were divided into two groups: uniform treatment with clopidogrel (untailored, early phase) and tailored treatment based on the results of aggregometry (late phase). Statistical comparisons included the Fisher exact test to compare categorical variables between the standard and aggregometry groups and the Mann-Whitney U test to compare ADP test values within the aggregometry group between groups receiving tailored or untailored treatment. RESULTS In the aggregometry group (68 patients, 71 procedures) there were 17 (25%) clopidogrel-resistant patients, according to a cut-off value of 468 area under the aggregation curve; 12 underwent FDS implantation under tailored antiaggregant medication. In the standard treatment group (32 patients, 33 procedures) there were 3 (9.1%) spontaneous thrombotic events and 1 (3.3%) technical hemorrhagic complication. In the aggregometry group there were 2 (2.8%) spontaneous hemorrhagic events and 1 (1.4%) technical ischemic complication. In the aggregometry group, thrombotic complications and morbidity were lower than in the standard (no test) group (p<0.03). CONCLUSIONS Tailoring platelet reactivity according to multiple electrode aggregometry decreases the rate of thrombotic complications after intracranial FDS implantation.",9lngcv90

This study was undertaken with the aim of determining and improving signs and symptoms of venous disease (measured by venous clinical severity score) and complications (by routine surveillance ultrasound and long-term post-operative follow up) for each treatment strategy. METHODS We performed a retrospective evaluation of prospectively collected data from 979 limbs undergoing procedures for significant varicose veins and venous insufficiency from March 2008 until June 2014 performed at a single tertiary referral hospital. Patient demographics, Clinical Etiology Anatomy and Pathophysiology classification, venous clinical severity scores pre- and post-procedure, treatment chosen, and peri-operative complications were collected; descriptive statistics were calculated and unadjusted surgical outcomes for patients stratified by the procedure performed. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the relationship between procedure type and thrombotic complications after adjusting for patient characteristics, severity of disease, pre-operative anticoagulation, and post-operative compression. RESULT Venous clinical severity scores improved more with radiofrequency ablation + transilluminated powered phlebectomy as compared to radiofrequency ablation alone (3.8 ± 3.4 vs. 3.2 ± 3.1, p = 0.018). Regarding deep venous thrombosis, there was no significant difference between radiofrequency ablation + transilluminated powered phlebectomy vs. radiofrequency ablation alone. There was no statistical difference in asymptomatic endovenous heat-induced thrombosis or infection, although there were slightly more hematomas and cases of asymptomatic superficial thrombophlebitis with combined therapy. On multivariable analysis, only procedure type predicted thrombotic complications. CONCLUSION Ablation of axial reflux plus transilluminated powered phlebectomy produces improved outcomes as measured by venous clinical severity score, with slight increases in minor post-operative complications and should be strongly considered as initial therapy when patients present with significant symptomatic varicose veins and superficial venous insufficiency. Implementation of a standardized thromboprophylaxis protocol with individual risk assessment results in few significant thrombotic complications amongst high-risk patients, thus potentially obviating the need for routine post-operative duplex.",tpe3d0y1

Venous and lymphatic disorders,Assessment of thrombotic adverse events and treatment patterns associated with varicose vein treatment.,"OBJECTIVE This retrospective study assessed varicose vein treatment patterns and associated thrombotic complications in a real-world setting. METHODS A retrospective study was conducted with health care claims data from Truven Health, covering more than 40 million insured lives per year and representing all U.S. census regions. The study sample included subjects aged ≥ 18 years with a new diagnosis of varicose veins who had received at least one invasive treatment (eg, surgery, endovenous thermal ablation [radiofrequency or laser], or sclerotherapy [liquid or foam]). The adverse events of interest included a coded diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism within 30 days of a claim for invasive treatment. Patients treated between January 1, 2008, and June 30, 2012, were observed for up to 2 years after diagnosis. RESULTS There were 985,632 unique subjects diagnosed with varicose veins; of them, a total of 131,887 subjects met all of the study criteria: 63,033 (47.8%) having multiple therapies; 22,980 (17.4%) having laser ablation; 21,637 (16.4%) having radiofrequency ablation; 12,708 (9.6%) having sclerotherapy; and 11,529 (8.7%) having surgery. The mean age of the sample was 52.8 years, ranging from 51.5 years (surgery cohort) to 54.5 years (radiofrequency ablation cohort); 77% of the sample was female, ranging from 71% (radiofrequency ablation cohort) to 92% (sclerotherapy cohort). The mean time to treatment after diagnosis was 105 days, ranging from 75 days (sclerotherapy cohort) to 116 days (radiofrequency ablation cohort). The diagnosed prevalence (percentage of subjects within each treatment cohort) of DVT was as follows: radiofrequency ablation, 4.4%; multiple therapies--same day, 3.4%; laser ablation, 3.1%; multiple therapies--deferred, 2.6%; surgery, 2.4%; and sclerotherapy, 0.8%. For pulmonary embolism, the diagnosed prevalence was as follows: radiofrequency ablation, surgery, and laser ablation, 0.3% each; and multiple therapies--same day, multiple therapies--deferred, and sclerotherapy, 0.2% each. CONCLUSIONS Thrombotic complications associated with invasive varicose vein treatments in the real-world setting may be higher than what has been reported in clinical trials, particularly in regard to DVT after endovenous thermal ablation therapy. A better understanding of these patterns of adverse events may have an impact on new strategies to safely and effectively manage patients with varicose veins.",5vsae1he

INDICATION anatomic or pathophysiologic indication includes venous diameter within 2-20 mm, reflux time ≥0.5 seconds and distance from the skin ≥5 mm or subfascial location. Access: it is recommended to access at or above the knee joint for great saphenous vein and above the mid-calf for small saphenous vein. Catheter placement: the catheter tip should be placed 2.0 cm inferior to the saphenofemoral or saphenopopliteal junction. Endovenous heat-induced thrombosis ≥class III should be treated with low-molecular weight heparin. Tumescent solution: the composition of solution can be variable (e.g., 2% lidocaine 20 mL+500 mL normal saline+bicarbonate 2.5 mL with/without epinephrine). Infiltration can be done from each direction. Ablation: two cycles' ablation for the first proximal segment of saphenous vein and the segment with the incompetent perforators is recommended. The other segments should be ablated one time. During RF energy delivery, it is recommended to apply external compression. Concomitant procedure: It is recommended to do simultaneously ambulatory phlebectomy. For sclerotherapy, it is recommended to defer at least 2 weeks. Post-procedural management: post-procedural ambulation is encouraged to reduce the thrombotic complications. Compression stocking should be applied for at least 7 days. Minor daily activity is not limited, but strenuous activities should be avoided for 2 weeks. It is suggested to take showers after 24 hours and tub baths, swimming, or soaking in water after 2 weeks.",6shnmxyf

Historically, this has been treated with an open surgical approach (with high morbidity) and with angioplasty in more recent years. Herein we describe technical aspects of stenting of the IVC in patients with recalcitrant chronic occlusive disease and evaluate its outcomes. METHODS We reviewed all the patients treated in an endovascular fashion for venous disease at our institution from 2005 to 2014 to identify and to include those with IVC stent placement in this study. Clinical characteristics, treatment details, and outcomes data were collected from medical records. Primary end points were technical success, symptom resolution, freedom from reintervention, and patency rate at follow-up. RESULTS Twenty-eight patients (15 men) with a mean age of 48 ± 2.7 years underwent IVC stent placement for 16 occlusions (4 congenital) and 12 high-grade stenoses. Hypercoagulable state was noted in 14 patients, 7 of whom had malignant disease. A previously placed IVC filter was present in 13 patients. Median time from onset of symptoms to presentation was 81 months (3-480 months). Lytic therapy with tissue plasminogen activator (Alteplase) was performed in 12 patients for a median of 2 days (range, 1-3 days). Self-expanding stents (Wallstent; Boston Scientific, Natick, Mass) were used most commonly in the IVC (n = 22) with or without adjunctive use of balloon-expandable stents (Palmaz stent; Cordis, New Brunswick, NJ). Technical success was 100%. At median follow-up of 10 months (range, 0-56 months), thrombotic complications requiring reintervention occurred in four patients at 1, 4, 8, and 37 months. One patient died at 2 weeks secondary to underlying malignant disease. Freedom from reintervention, patency rate, and symptom-free survival rate at 2 years were 84%, 90%, and 80%. CONCLUSIONS Endovascular stenting for chronic occlusive disease of the IVC is safe and effective in the midterm follow-up, with minimal morbidity. Reintervention rate is low, with excellent functional outcomes.",ydt8uefz

American journal of neuroradiology,Use of flow-diverting devices in fusiform vertebrobasilar giant aneurysms: a report on periprocedural course and long-term follow-up.," AND PURPOSE Fusiform vertebrobasilar giant aneurysms are a rare (<1% of all intracranial aneurysms) but challenging aneurysm subtype. Little data are available on the natural history of this aneurysm subtype and the impact of the use of flow-diverting stents on the long-term clinical and imaging follow-up. In this article, we present our experience with the treatment of fusiform vertebrobasilar giant aneurysms by flow diverting stents. We aim to stimulate a discussion of the best management paradigm for this challenging aneurysm subtype. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively identified 6 patients with fusiform vertebrobasilar giant aneurysms who had been treated with flow-diverting stents between October 2009 and March 2012 in our center. The available data were re-evaluated. The modified Rankin Scale score was assessed before intervention, during the stay in hospital, and at discharge. RESULTS Six patients were identified (all male; age range, 49-71 years; median age, 60 years). Handling of material was successful in all cases. No primary periprocedural complications occurred. The mean follow-up was 13 months (15 days to 29 months). During follow-up, 3 of 6 patients had recurrent cerebral infarctions, but no patient experienced SAH. Two patients presented with acute thrombotic stent occlusion. The modified Rankin Scale score was not higher than 3 in any of the cases before intervention, whereas the best mRS score at the last follow-up was 5. Four of 6 patients died during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Endovascular treatment of fusiform vertebrobasilar giant aneurysms with flow-diverting devices is feasible from a technical point of view; however, changes in hemodynamics with secondary thrombosis are not predictable. We currently do not intend to treat fusiform vertebrobasilar giant aneurysms with flow-diverting devices until we have further understanding of the pathophysiology, natural history, and hemodynamic effects of flow diversion.",23chkz48

We also checked the reference lists of included studies, systematic reviews, and practice guidelines, and we contacted experts in the field. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated any anticoagulant or antiplatelet agent, or both, in the secondary prevention of thrombosis in people diagnosed with APS according to the criteria valid when the study took place. We did not include studies specifically addressing women with obstetrical APS. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Pairs of review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias for the included studies. We resolved any discrepancies through discussion or by consulting a third review author and, in addition, one review author checked all the extracted data. MAIN RESULTS We included five studies involving 419 randomized participants with APS. Only one study was at low risk of bias in all domains. One study was at low risk of bias in all domains for objective outcomes but not for quality of life (measured using the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire). We judged the other three studies to be at unclear or high risk of bias in three or more domains.The duration of intervention ranged from 180 days to a mean of 3.9 years. One study compared rivaroxaban (a novel oral anticoagulant: NOAC) with standard warfarin treatment and reported no thrombotic or major bleeding events, but it was not powered to detect such differences (low-quality evidence). Investigators reported similar rates of clinically relevant non-major bleeding (risk ratio (RR) 1.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.25 to 8.33; moderate-quality evidence) and minor bleeding (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.51 to 2.83) for participants receiving rivaroxaban and the standard vitamin K antagonists (VKA). This study also reported some small benefit with rivaroxaban over the standard VKA treatment in terms of quality of life health state measured at 180 days with the EQ-5D-5L 100 mm visual analogue scale (mean difference (MD) 7 mm, 95% CI 2.01 to 11.99; low-quality evidence) but not measured as health utility (MD 0.04, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.10 [on a scale from 0 to 1]).Two studies compared high dose VKA (warfarin) with moderate/standard intensity VKA and found no differences in the rates of any thrombotic events (RR 2.22, 95% CI 0.79 to 6.23) or major bleeding (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.24 to 2.25) between the groups (low-quality evidence). Minor bleeding analyzed using the RR and any bleeding using the hazard ratio (HR) were more frequent in participants receiving high-intensity warfarin treatment compared to the standard-intensity therapy (RR 2.55, 95% CI 1.07 to 6.07; and HR 2.03, 95% CI 1.12 to 3.68; low-quality evidence).In one study, it was not possible to estimate the RR for stroke with a combination of VKA plus antiplatelet agent compared to a single antiplatelet agent, while for major bleeding, a single event occurred in the single antiplatelet agent group. In one study, comparing combined VKA plus antiplatelet agent with dual antiplatelet therapy, the RR of the risk of stroke over three years of observation was 5.00 (95% CI 0.26 to 98.0). In a single small study, the RR for stroke during one year of observation with a dual antiplatelet therapy compared to single antiplatelet drug was 0.14 (95% CI 0.01 to 2.60). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS There is not enough evidence for or against NOACs or for high-intensity VKA compared to the standard VKA therapy in the secondary prevention of thrombosis in people with APS. There is some evidence of harm for high-intensity VKA regarding minor and any bleeding. The evidence was also not sufficient to show benefit or harm for VKA plus antiplatelet agent or dual antiplatelet therapy compared to a single antiplatelet drug. Future studies should be adequately powered, with proper adherence to treatment, in order to evaluate the effects of anticoagulants, antiplatelets, or both, for secondary thrombosis prevention in APS. We have identified five ongoing trials mainly using NOACs in APS, so increasing experimental efforts are likely to yield additional evidence of clinical relevance in the near future.",e97q89qd

This meta-analysis compared perioperative administration of desmopressin to placebo. Desmopressin reduced red cell transfusions, blood loss and risk of re-operation due to bleeding. There were too few events to determine if there was a change in the risk of thrombotic events. SUMMARY Background Platelet dysfunction, including that caused by antiplatelet agents, increases the risk of perioperative bleeding. The optimal management of patients with platelet dysfunction undergoing surgery is unclear. Objectives To assess whether desmopressin reduces perioperative allogeneic red cell transfusion and bleeding in patients with platelet dysfunction. Patients/Methods We searched for randomized controlled trials in The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, the Transfusion Evidence Library and the ISI Web of Science to 7th July 2016. Data were pooled using mean difference (MD), relative risks or Peto odds ratios (pOR) using a random-effects model. Results Ten trials with 596 participants were identified, all in the setting of cardiac surgery. Platelet dysfunction was due to antiplatelet agents in six trials and cardiopulmonary bypass in four trials. Patients treated with desmopressin were transfused with fewer red cells (MD, -0.65 units; 95% Confidence Interval [CI], -1.16 to -0.13 units), lost less blood (MD, -253.93 mL; 95% CI, -408.01 to -99.85 mL) and had a lower risk of re-operation due to bleeding (pOR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.18-0.84). The GRADE quality of evidence was very low to moderate, suggesting considerable uncertainty over the results Conclusions Desmopressin may be a useful agent to reduce bleeding and transfusion requirements for people with platelet dysfunction or with a history of recent antiplatelet drug administration undergoing cardiac surgery.",5khtodcw

METHODS A post hoc analysis of the erythropoietin in traumatic brain injury (EPO-TBI) trial that included twice-weekly lower limb ultrasound screening. Venous thrombotic events were defined as ultrasound-proven proximal deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or clinically detected pulmonary embolism (PE). Results are reported as events, percentages or medians and interquartile range (IQR). Cox regression analysis was used to calculate adjusted hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for time to VTE and death. RESULTS Of 603 patients, 119 (19.7%) developed VTE, mostly comprising DVT (102 patients, 16.9%) with a smaller number of PE events (24 patients, 4.0%). Median time to DVT diagnosis was 6 days (IQR 2-11) and to PE diagnosis 6.5 days (IQR 2-16.5). Mechanical prophylaxis (MP) was used in 91% of patients on day 1, 97% of patients on day 3 and 98% of patients on day 7. Pharmacological prophylaxis was given in 5% of patients on day 1, 30% of patients on day 3 and 57% of patients on day 7. Factors associated with time to VTE were age (HR per year 1.02, 95% CI 1.01-1.03), patient weight (HR per kg 1.01, 95% CI 1-1.02) and TBI severity according to the International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials risk of poor outcome (HR per 10% increase 1.12, 95% CI 1.01-1.25). The development of VTE was not associated with mortality (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.51-1.65). CONCLUSIONS Despite mechanical and pharmacological prophylaxis, VTE occurs in one out of every five patients with TBI treated in the ICU. Higher age, greater weight and greater severity of TBI increase the risk. The development of VTE was not associated with excess mortality.",n49mozpm

Thrombosis in placental and spinal vessels and subsequent ischemic injury in EHV-1-infected horses manifests clinically as abortion and myeloencephalopathy. We have previously shown that addition of heparin anticoagulants to equine platelet-rich plasma (PRP) can abolish ex vivo EHV-1-induced platelet activation. The goal of this study was to test whether platelets isolated from horses treated with unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) were resistant to ex vivo EHV-1-induced activation. In a masked, block-randomized placebo-controlled cross-over trial, 9 healthy adult horses received 4 subcutaneous injections at q. 12 h intervals of one of the following treatments: UFH (100 U/kg loading dose, 3 maintenance doses of 80 U/kg), 2 doses of LMWH (enoxaparin) 80 U/kg 24 h apart with saline at the intervening 12 h intervals, or 4 doses of saline. Blood samples were collected before treatment and after 36 h, 40 h (4 h after the last injection) and 60 h (24 h after the last injection). Two strains of EHV-1, Ab4 and RacL11, were added to PRP ex vivo and platelet membrane expression of P selectin was measured as a marker of platelet activation. Drug concentrations were monitored in a Factor Xa inhibition (anti-Xa) bioassay. We found that LMWH, but not UFH, inhibited platelet activation induced by low concentrations (1 × 106 plaque forming units/mL) of both EHV-1 strains at 40 h. At this time point, all horses had anti-Xa activities above 0.1 U/ml (range 0.15-0.48 U/ml) with LMWH, but not UFH. By 60 h, a platelet inhibitory effect was no longer detected and anti-Xa activity had decreased (range 0.03 to 0.07 U/ml) in LMWH-treated horses. Neither heparin inhibited platelet activation induced by high concentrations (5 × 106 plaque forming units/mL) of the RacL11 strain. We found substantial between horse variability in EHV-1-induced platelet activation at baseline and after treatment. Minor injection site reactions developed in horses given either heparin. These results suggest that LMWH therapy may prevent thrombotic sequelae of EHV-1, however further evaluation of dosage regimens is required.",0jlk1fs0

Our objective was to investigate anticoagulation reversal and resumption strategies by evaluating incidences of haemorrhagic and thromboembolic complications, thereby defining an optimal time-window when to restart therapeutic anticoagulation (TA) in patients with MHV and ICH. Methods and results We pooled individual patient-data (n = 2504) from a nationwide multicentre cohort-study (RETRACE, conducted at 22 German centres) and eventually identified MHV-patients (n = 137) with anticoagulation-associated ICH for outcome analyses. The primary outcome consisted of major haemorrhagic complications analysed during hospital stay according to treatment exposure (restarted TA vs. no-TA). Secondary outcomes comprised thromboembolic complications, the composite outcome (haemorrhagic and thromboembolic complications), timing of TA, and mortality. Adjusted analyses involved propensity-score matching and multivariable cox-regressions to identify optimal timing of TA. In 66/137 (48%) of patients TA was restarted, being associated with increased haemorrhagic (TA = 17/66 (26%) vs. no-TA = 4/71 (6%); P < 0.01) and a trend to decreased thromboembolic complications (TA = 1/66 (2%) vs. no-TA = 7/71 (10%); P = 0.06). Controlling treatment crossovers provided an incidence rate-ratio [hazard ratio (HR) 10.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.67-35.70; P < 0.01] in disadvantage of TA for haemorrhagic complications. Analyses of TA-timing displayed significant harm until Day 13 after ICH (HR 7.06, 95% CI 2.33-21.37; P < 0.01). The hazard for the composite-balancing both complications, was increased for restarted TA until Day 6 (HR 2.51, 95% CI 1.10-5.70; P = 0.03). Conclusion Restarting TA within less than 2 weeks after ICH in patients with MHV was associated with increased haemorrhagic complications. Optimal weighing-between least risks for thromboembolic and haemorrhagic complications-provided an earliest starting point of TA at Day 6, reserved only for patients at high thromboembolic risk.",ppoof41c

Flow diversion using the pipeline embolization device for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms necessitates the use of dual antiplatelet therapy to reduce this risk. The use of platelet function testing before pipeline embolization device placement remains controversial. METHODS A retrospective review of prospectively maintained databases at 3 academic institutions was performed from the years 2009 to 2016 to identify patients with intracranial aneurysms treated with pipeline embolization device placement. Clinical and radiographic data were analyzed with emphasis on thromboembolic complications and clopidogrel responsiveness. RESULTS A total of 402 patients underwent 414 pipeline embolization device procedures for the treatment of 465 intracranial aneurysms. Thromboembolic complications were encountered in 9.2% of procedures and were symptomatic in 5.6%. Clopidogrel nonresponders experienced a significantly higher rate of thromboembolic complications compared with clopidogrel responders (17.4% versus 5.6%). This risk was significantly lower in nonresponders who were switched to ticagrelor when compared with patients who remained on clopidogrel (2.7% versus 24.4%). In patients who remained on clopidogrel, the rate of thromboembolic complications was significantly lower in those who received a clopidogrel boost within 24 hours pre-procedure when compared with those who did not (9.8% versus 51.9%). There was no significant difference in the rate of hemorrhagic complications between groups. CONCLUSIONS Clopidogrel nonresponders experienced a significantly higher rate of thromboembolic complications when compared with clopidogrel responders. However, this risk seems to be mitigated in nonresponders who were switched to ticagrelor or received a clopidogrel boost within 24 hours pre-procedure.",lfj1gwhx

This study analyzed the risk factors and management of hemorrhagic complications, such as hemoperitoneum, hemothorax, and hemobilia. METHODS We performed 4133 RFA treatments in 2154 patients with primary and metastatic liver tumors from February 1999 to December 2007. Of these, we enrolled patients with hemorrhagic complications and reviewed their medical records thoroughly. The risk factors for each hemorrhagic complication were analyzed using unconditional logistic regression. RESULTS Hemorrhagic complications occurred in 63 out of 4133 treatments (1.5%), including hemoperitoneum in 29 (0.7%), hemothorax in 14 (0.3%), and hemobilia in 20 (0.5%). Eleven, 8, and 4 of these patients, respectively, were categorized as major complications requiring blood transfusion or drainage. Two patients died after hemoperitoneum. Logistic regression analysis revealed large tumor size [odds ratio (OR) 1.06 per 1 mm increase in diameter] and low platelet count (OR 0.88 per 10,000/microL increase) were significant risk factors for hemoperitoneum. The location of tumor nodules was a significant risk factor for hemothorax (segment 7, OR 2.31) and hemobilia (segment 1, OR 3.30). Other factors, including the number of needle insertions or the duration of ablation, were not significant. CONCLUSIONS Although hemorrhagic complications were relatively rare with percutaneous RFA, specific treatments, such as blood transfusion and drainage, were required in some cases.

The complication rates were compared to published data for similar endovascular methods. RESULTS There were no deaths, major bleeding events, or clinical deterioration of MS. Access site complications included limited groin hematoma (5, 1.0%); there were no arteriovenous fistulas or puncture site infections. Systemic complications included only rare cardiac arrhythmias (6, 1.2%). Procedure-related complications included vein rupture (2, 0.4%), vein dissection (15, 3.0%), acute in-stent/in-segment thrombosis (8, 1.6%), and acute recoil (1, 0.2%); there was no stent migration or fracture or distal embolization. Mean fluoroscopy time was 22.7 minutes, and mean contrast volume was 136.3 mL. CONCLUSION Endovascular therapy appears to be a safe and reliable method for treating CCSVI. Innovations such as purpose-specific materials and devices are needed, as are case-controlled and randomized data to establish efficacy in ameliorating MS symptoms.",cu0njduq

Using transcranial Doppler sonography, we measured the rate of microemboli in 23 patients treated with flow-diverting stents. Patients received preprocedural dual antiplatelet medications and intraprocedural heparinization. Point-of-care platelet reactivity testing was performed before the procedure, and nonresponders (>213 P2Y12/ADP receptor reactivity units) received additional thienopyridine. Transcranial Doppler sonography was performed within 12-24 hours. Microemboli were detected in 3 patients (13%), 2 of whom were initially nonresponders. There was no association between the presence of microemboli and procedural or neurologic complications, aneurysm size, number of stents, or procedure time. Eight procedures (34.8%) required additional thienopyridine for inadequate platelet inhibition, and 3 required further treatment for persistent nonresponse to point-of-care platelet reactivity testing. There were 6 technical and 2 postoperative complications; none were associated with inadequate platelet inhibition or microemboli. The combination of routine point-of-care platelet reactivity testing and postprocedural microembolic monitoring may help identify patients at risk for thromboembolic complications after flow-diverting stents.",5g2pqd7a

Materials and Methods Consecutive patients aged 6 months to 2 years were enrolled at our institution between June 2013 and May 2017. Consenting patients were randomized to antibiotic prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus no antibiotic. Patients had catheterized urine samples obtained at surgery and 6-10 days postoperatively. The primary outcome was bacteriuria and pyuria at postoperative urine collection. Secondary outcomes included symptomatic urinary tract infection and postoperative complications. Results 70 patients consented to the study, of which 35 were randomized to receive antibiotics compared to 32 who did not. Demographics, severity of hypospadias, and type of repair were similar between the groups. Patients in the treatment group had significantly less pyuria (18%) and bacteriuria (11%) present at stent removal compared to the nontreatment group (55% and 63%; p=0.01 and p < 0.001, resp.). No patient had a symptomatic urinary tract infection. There were 11 postoperative complications. Conclusions Routine antibiotic prophylaxis appears to significantly decrease bacteriuria and pyuria in the immediate postoperative period; however, no difference was observed in symptomatic urinary tract infection or postoperative complications.

METHODS This was an intention-to-treat randomized controlled trial conducted in an academic medical center on two different sites between September 2012 and September 2015. All patients older than 18 years or age without known history of previous central line, contraindication to the use of a specific arm or hospitalized in the intensive care unit regardless of coagulation status, were considered for the study. Participants were randomized to the left or right arm group and were followed until catheter removal. Data collected included: PICC characteristics, insertion details, gender, arm dominance, history of malignancy, reason for insertion/removal, incidence of a complication and total dwell time. One-tailed hypothesis testing using a univariate logistic regression with odds ratio (OR) calculation was used to analyze the results. There were 202 patients randomly assigned, totaling 7657 catheter-days; 103 patients to the right-side group and 99 patients to the left-side group. RESULTS Participants in both groups were statistically equivalent for right handedness, gender, oncologic status, average dwell time and total catheter days. The overall incidence of complications on the right side was 23% versus 34% on the left side, confirming the hypothesis that right-sided insertions led to fewer complications (p = 0.046). The risk of a complication was reduced by 40% with right-sided insertion (OR 0.58 (CI: 0.31-1.09). CONCLUSIONS This study indicated fewer complications with right-sided insertion irrespective of hand dominance.",cn1id925

In patients with MMA and moderate-to-severe renal impairment, combined liver–kidney transplantation is indicated. However, clinical experience of these transplantation options in patients with PA and MMA remains limited and fragmented. We undertook an overview of post-transplantation outcomes in patients with PA and MMA using the current available evidence. METHODS: A literature search identified publications on the use of transplantation in patients with PA and MMA. Publications were considered if they presented adequate demographic and outcome data from patients with PA or MMA. Publications that did not report any specific outcomes for patients or provided insufficient data were excluded. RESULTS: Seventy publications were identified of which 38 were full papers. A total of 373 patients underwent liver/kidney/combined liver–kidney transplantation for PA or MMA. The most typical reason for transplantation was recurrent metabolic decompensation. A total of 27 post-transplant deaths were reported in patients with PA [14.0% (27/194)]. For patients with MMA, 18 post-transplant deaths were reported [11% (18/167)]. A total of 62 complications were reported in 115 patients with PA (54%) with cardiomyopathy (n = 12), hepatic arterial thrombosis (HAT; n = 14) and viral infections (n = 12) being the most commonly reported. A total of 52 complications were reported in 106 patients with MMA (49%) with viral infections (n = 14) and renal failure/impairment (n = 10) being the most commonly reported. CONCLUSIONS: Liver transplantation and combined liver–kidney transplantation appears to benefit some patients with PA or MMA, respectively, but this approach does not provide complete correction of the metabolic defect and some patients remain at risk from disease-related and transplantation-related complications, including death. Thus, all treatment avenues should be exhausted before consideration of organ transplantation and the benefits of this approach must be weighed against the risk of perioperative complications on an individual basis.",7ed958ve

METHODS 40 patients (30 women, 10 men) with 50 cerebral aneurysms treated in six Italian neurointerventional centers with the p64 Flow Modulation Device between April 2013 and September 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS Complete occlusion was obtained in 44/50 aneurysms (88%) and partial occlusion in 3 (6%). In the other three aneurysms (6%), two cases of asymptomatic in-stent thrombosis and one intraprocedural occlusion of the parent vessel occurred. Technical complications were observed in eight procedures (16%). Permanent morbidity due to acute in-stent thrombosis and consequent ischemic stroke occurred in one patient (2.5%). No delayed aneurysm rupture, subarachnoid or intraparenchymal hemorrhage, or ischemic complications occurred and there were no deaths. CONCLUSIONS Endovascular treatment with the p64 Flow Modulation Device is a safe treatment for unruptured cerebral aneurysms, resulting in a high rate of occlusion. As with other flow diverter devices, we recommend this treatment mainly for large-necked aneurysms of the internal carotid artery siphon. However, endovascular treatment with the p64 device should also be encouraged in difficult cases such as aneurysms of the posterior circulation and beyond the circle of Willis.",gjgwqzxz

The objective of this study was to analyze treatment outcomes of this treatment modality. METHODS A retrospective evaluation of prospectively collected data from all patients undergoing TIPP procedure for symptomatic varicose veins during a recent 12-year period was performed. Pertinent patient demographics, disease classification, perioperative complications, quality of life, and treatment outcomes were collected and analyzed. RESULTS A total of 1167 limbs in 1034 patients (mean age, 52.4 years) were treated during the study period. The mean procedure time was 18.4 ± 8.9 minutes (range, 6.0-82.0 minutes). The mean number of incisions for TIPP procedure was 6.3 ± 3.6. All TIPP procedures were technically successful, and no patient required conversion to hook stab phlebectomy. Fifteen (1.5%) patients developed residual or recurrent varicosities, which were treated with sclerotherapy during the follow-up period. Postoperative complications included hematoma at 2 weeks (5.8%), ecchymosis at 2 weeks (32.9%), saphenous neuropathy (0.3%), cellulitis (1.0%), and skin pigmentation (1.9%). There was no postoperative deep vein thrombosis or mortality.

The existing DLBCs allow the delivery of self-expandable stents but do not offer the possibility to deploy flow-diverters. Despite the increasing use and success of flow-diverters, there have been numerous reports of procedural complications such as early in-stent thrombosis or delayed distal embolization. It seems that these complications can be avoided by correct stent positioning and adequate wall apposition, achieved either by manoeuvres with the microguidewire and/or microcatheter or by performing balloon angioplasty following an exchange guidewire manoeuvre. Objective Report the use of a new DLBC able to deliver a flow-diverter. Methods A 41-year-old woman presented to our hospital with binocular horizontal diplopia for two weeks and reduced visual acuity. A left internal carotid artery aneurysm involving the cavernous and ophthalmic segments was found, with a maximum height of 19 mm and a broad 8 mm neck. It presented extra- and intra-dural components and the parent vessel was significantly narrowed. A decision was made to perform endovascular treatment of the aneurysm with placement of a flow diverter through a DLBC. Results Patency and adequate expansion of the flow diverter with evident intra-aneurysmal contrast stasis was observed in the final angiogram. No peri-procedural complications were observed. Conclusion This is a technical note demonstrating the feasibility of a new device to deploy a flow diverter, aiming to improve wall apposition and stent configuration without the need of additional devices or exchange manoeuvres.",4u9kp0o4

Stent-assisted coiling (SAC) is associated with increased complications and requires dual antiplatelet therapy. OBJECTIVE To compare treatment of unruptured, wide-necked aneurysms with a dual-microcatheter technique (DMT) versus SAC. METHODS Between 2006 and 2011, 100 patients with unruptured wide-necked intracranial aneurysms were treated with DMT and 160 with SAC. Over time there was a significant decrease in the use of SAC and a corresponding increase in DMT. The investigators matched 60 patients treated with DMT blinded to outcome in a 1:2 fashion based on maximal aneurysm dome diameter with 120 patients treated with SAC. Outcomes were determined with conditional (matched) multivariate analysis. RESULTS There were no significant differences in patient or aneurysm characteristics between cohorts, including aneurysm diameter, neck width, or volume. Overall packing density and coil volume achieved was not significantly different between cohorts. There were higher rates of overall complications in those receiving SAC (19.2%) compared with DMT (5.0%; p=0.012), but no significant difference in major complications (8.3% vs 1.7%, respectively; p=0.103). At a mean follow-up of 27.0 ± 18.9 months, rates of retreatment did not differ between DMT (15.1%) and SAC (17.7%). Delayed in-stent stenosis occurred in five patients and in-stent thrombosis in four patients treated with SAC. There was no difference in favorable functional outcome (modified Rankin score 0-2) between those treated with DMT (90.6%) compared with SAC (91.2%). CONCLUSIONS DMT and SAC are effective endovascular approaches for unruptured, wide-necked aneurysms; however, DMT may result in less morbidity. Further long-term studies are necessary to determine the optimal indications for these treatment options.",cy3cltp4

Although cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity have emerged as predominant noninfectious complications of CD19 CAR T-cell therapy, infections associated with this treatment modality have not been well documented. METHODS: We analyzed infectious complications that followed CD19 CAR T-cell therapy in 53 adult patients with relapsed B-ALL enrolled in a phase I clinical trial at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (NCT01044069). RESULTS: Overall, 22 patients (42%) experienced 26 infections (17 bacterial, 4 fungal, and 5 viral) within the first 30 days of CAR T-cell infusion. In 10 of 32 (31%) patients in whom complete remission was achieved, 15 infections developed between days 31 and 180; the majority of these late infections were due to respiratory viruses. In general, bacterial, fungal, and viral infections were detected at a median of 18, 23, and 48 days, respectively, after CAR T-cell infusion. CRS grade 3 or higher was independently associated with increased risk of subsequent infection (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 2.67; P = .05) and in particular with bloodstream infection (adjusted HR, 19.97; P < .001). Three of 53 patients (6%) died of an infection-related cause. CONCLUSIONS: Infections in adult patients with relapsed B-ALL are common after CD19 CAR T-cell therapy. Understanding the infectious complications that are temporally coincident with CD19 CAR T-cell therapy is critical for developing effective prophylactic and other supportive care measures to improve clinical outcomes.

Observational studies to assess clinical outcome and related complications have been published. Clear evidence is required to better understand the safety profile of the WEB device. The authors here present a multicenter series that provides a detailed safety analysis focused on patient selection, procedural events, and technical issues of treated patients throughout the United Kingdom (UK). METHODS A nationwide password-protected database was set up to collect anonymous information across the UK (14 centers). Complications and clinical outcome were analyzed for the initial 109 patients (112 procedures). An independent root cause analysis classified the complications into groups (procedural, disease, device, ancillary device, and other). The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) was used as a marker of clinical outcome. RESULTS Each of the 109 patients had 1 aneurysm suitable for WEB treatment (109 aneurysms). Three patients had 2 procedures, making a total of 112 procedures performed. Eight procedures were abandoned because of access issues; 2 patients went on to have a successful procedure. All 109 patients had a preprocedure and discharge mRS scores recorded. One hundred patients had a recorded mRS score from a > 3-month follow-up. Deployment of the WEB device was successful in 103 (94.5%) of 109 patients and 104 (92.9%) of 112 procedures. One patient had 2 successful WEB procedures on separate occasions. Patients without a successfully implanted WEB device were included in the analysis. Selection analysis showed that the average patient age was 56.5 years among 34 men and 75 women. The percentage of incidental aneurysms was 58.7%, acute 16.5%, symptomatic 18.3%, and recurrent 6.4%. Further results analysis showed that 40 (36.7%) of 109 patients had recorded adverse events, including those unrelated to the WEB device. Events that could be related to the WEB device numbered 17 (15.6%) among the 109 patients. Two patients with device-related complications were symptomatic. Overall, 11 patients (10.1%) had persistent clinical sequelae. Thromboembolism was the most prevalent event, affecting 15.6% of the patients (17 of 109), and 6.4% of the patients (7 of 109) with a thromboembolism were symptomatic. Overall mortality before discharge was 0% and at the > 3-month follow-up was 5% (5 of 100 patients). Morbidity was defined as an mRS score increase to > 2. Overall morbidity at discharge was 1.8% (2 of 109) and at the > 3-month follow-up was 6% (6 of 100). No device-related morbidity or mortality was associated with this group. CONCLUSIONS The UK data show that the WEB device is safe for clinical use. Thromboembolic complication adds a risk that should be minimized with appropriate anticoagulation and correct sizing of the device. There is scope for further evaluation and standardization of an anticoagulation regimen for the WEB device.",wrp0xnvg

We report our institution's experience treating AT-IVC using endovascular methods. METHODS A 10-year retrospective review of patients presenting with symptomatic IVC thrombosis between the years 2005 and 2014 was performed. Demographic data, treatment modalities, and outcomes were reviewed. RESULTS Twenty-five patients (44% men) underwent treatment for acute (<2 weeks) symptomatic IVC thrombosis. Presenting symptoms included pain and limb swelling in 23 (92%), motor dysfunction in 16 (64%), sensory loss in 14 (56%), and pulmonary embolism (PE) in 2 (8%) patients. Phlegmasia cerulea dolens was present in 5 patients, a history of malignancy was identified in 7 patients, and 21 patients had an IVC filter at presentation (Trapease 12, G2X 3, Option 2, Eclipse 2, Meridian 2). Four patients had a documented hypercoagulable state, 21 patients underwent venous angioplasty, and 7 (28%) patients underwent venous stenting of the IVC or iliofemoral veins. Significant (>50% luminal gain) angiographic resolution of venous thrombus was achieved in all 25 patients. Twenty-one (84%) patients reported moderate-to-complete symptomatic improvement immediately after completion of the procedures. Two patients had a clinically symptomatic PE and 1 patient underwent an above-knee amputation secondary to venous gangrene. Other complications included 6 minor bleeding complications (2 local hematoma, 4 hematuria) all of which resolved spontaneously. There were 2 major bleeding complications (1 disseminated intravascular coagulation, 1 retroperitoneal hematoma). CONCLUSIONS Endovascular treatment of AT-IVC, regardless of etiology, is safe and effective with excellent short-term clinical results. An aggressive endovascular approach to treatment of AT-IVC is warranted even in the presence of a thrombosed vena cava filter.",1ayspy8e

Ultimately, one-third of patients with a parastomal hernia will need surgical correction due to frequent leakage or life-threatening bowel obstruction or strangulation. However, treatment remains a challenge resulting in high recurrence rates. Two single center trials demonstrated that the frequency of parastomal hernias decreases by prophylactic placement of a mesh around the stoma at the time of formation. Unfortunately, both studies were small-sized, single-center studies and with these small numbers less common complications could be missed which were the reasons to initiate a prospective randomized multicenter trial to determine if a retromuscular, preperitoneal mesh at the stoma site prevents parastomal hernia and does not cause unacceptable complications. METHODS One hundred and fifty patients undergoing open procedure, elective formation of a permanent end-colostomy will be randomized into two groups. In the intervention group an end-colostomy is created with placement of a preperitioneal, retromuscular lightweight monofilament polypropylene mesh, and compared to a group with a traditional stoma without mesh. Patients will be recruited from 14 teaching hospitals in the Netherlands during a 2-year period. Primary endpoint is the incidence of parastomal hernia. Secondary endpoints are stoma complications, cost-effectiveness, and quality of life. Follow-up will be performed at 3 weeks, 3 months and at 1, 2, and 5 years. To find a difference of 20% with a power of 90%, a total number of 134 patients must be included. All results will be reported according to the CONSORT 2010 statement. DISCUSSION The PREVENT-trial is a multicenter randomized controlled trial powered to determine whether prophylactic placement of a polypropylene mesh decreases the incidence of a parastomal hernia versus the traditional stoma formation without a mesh.

METHODS A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library on the following therapies for incompetence of SSVs: surgery, endovenous laser ablation (EVLA), radiofrequency ablation (RFA), ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy (UGFS), steam ablation, and mechanochemical endovenous ablation (MOCA). The search found 49 articles (5 randomized controlled trials, 44 cohort studies) reporting on the different treatment modalities: surgery (n=9), EVLA (n=28), RFA (n=9), UGFS (n=6), and MOCA (n=1). A random-effects model was used to estimate the primary outcome of anatomical success, which was defined as closure of the treated vein on follow-up duplex ultrasound imaging. The estimate is reported with the 95% confidence interval (CI). Secondary outcomes were technical success and major complications [paresthesia and deep vein thrombosis (DVT)], given as the weighted means. RESULTS The pooled anatomical success rate was 58.0% (95% CI 40.9% to 75.0%) for surgery in 798 SSVs, 98.5% (95% CI 97.7% to 99.2%) for EVLA in 2950 SSVs, 97.1% (95% CI 94.3% to 99.9%) for RFA in 386 SSVs, and 63.6% (95% CI 47.1% to 80.1%) for UGFS in 494 SSVs. One study reported results of MOCA, with an anatomical success rate of 94%. Neurologic complications were most frequently reported after surgery (mean 19.6%) and thermal ablation (EVLA: mean 4.8%; RFA: mean 9.7%). Deep venous thrombosis was a rare complication (0% to 1.2%). CONCLUSION Endovenous thermal ablation (EVLA/RFA) should be preferred to surgery and foam sclerotherapy in the treatment of SSV incompetence. Although data on nonthermal techniques in SSV are still sparse, the potential benefits, especially the reduced risk of nerve injury, might be of considerable clinical importance.",zv3601lz

The natural history of these aneurysms has gradually been elucidated. The purpose of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of endovascular treatment for these aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed a retrospective review of 377 patients with 400 paraclinoid aneurysms treated between January 2006 and December 2012. Their clinical records, endovascular reports, and radiologic and clinical outcomes were analyzed. Because aneurysms ≥7 mm are at higher risk of rupture, we classified aneurysms as small (<7 mm) or large (≥7 mm). RESULTS Overall, 115 of the 400 aneurysms (28.8%) were large (≥7 mm). Thromboembolic complications were found significantly more often with large aneurysms than with small ones (7.4% vs 1.0%, P = .001). Hemorrhagic complications were found only with small aneurysms (0.7%). The 6-month morbidity rates were similar for small (1.0%) and large (0.8%) aneurysms. Immediate angiographic outcomes were similar (P = .37), whereas recurrences and retreatment occurred more frequently with large aneurysms (P = .001 and P = .007, respectively). Multivariate analysis showed that aneurysm size was the only independent predictor for recurrence (P = .005). Most recurrences (81%) were detected by scheduled angiography at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS Aneurysm size influenced the type of complication (thromboembolic or hemorrhagic) and the recurrence rate. Given the approximately 1% annual rupture rate for aneurysms ≥7 mm, analysis of our data supports the rationale of using prophylactic endovascular treatment for unruptured paraclinoid aneurysms ≥7 mm.",769p5x1c

METHODS All patients who underwent RFA of the GSV from 1 May 2013 to 30 September 2013 in eight of our vein centers were included. Duplex ultrasound scans (DUSs) were performed prior to treatment on all patients and 2-3 days, and 1 month after procedure. Demographic data, GSV diameters, and other relevant data were recorded. Clinical, Etiologic, Anatomic, Pathologic (CEAP) classification and Venous Clinical Severity Scores (VCSSs) were determined prior to ablation and one month later. Patients who developed endovenous heat induced thrombosis (EHIT) were followed till resolution. RESULTS A total of 205 patients had one cycle treatment (group A) and 204 had two cycle treatment (group B). The two groups were comparable in their demography, CEAP classification, and VCSS scores. The rate of failure of ablation and incidence of EHIT were also not significantly different. The incidence of complications was low, <5% in both groups and all were minor. CONCLUSION Two cycle treatment of the proximal GSV for vein ablation does not improve the success rate of vein closure in the short term, compared to one cycle treatment. It also does not increase the risks of DVT, EHIT, major bleeding, and other complications. However, we do not know at what diameter two cycles may be superior to one cycle.",urgheo10

Part A,Long-term results of laparoscopic treatment of esophageal achalasia in children: a multicentric survey.," This report describes three Italian centers' experience in the treatment of children with esophageal achalasia. PATIENTS AND METHODS Between June 2000 and June 2012, 31 children (13 girls and 18 boys, with a median age of 8.4 years) affected by esophageal achalasia were treated in three different institutions with an esophagomyotomy according to Heller's procedure via laparoscopy associated with a Dor antireflux procedure. Between 2000 and 2005 (for 14 patients) we used mono- or bipolar coagulation to perform myotomy; after 2005 (for 17 patients) we used the new hemostatic devices to perform it. RESULTS Median length of surgery was 120 minutes. Median hospital stay was 4 days. We recorded eight complications in our series: 3 patients (9.6%) had a mucosal perforation, and 5 children (16.1%) presented dysphagia after surgery. When comparing the data before and after 2005, it seems that the new hemostatic devices statistically shortened the length of surgery (P<.01, Student's t test). CONCLUSIONS On the basis of our experience, laparoscopic Heller's myotomy associated with an antireflux procedure is a safe and effective method for the treatment of achalasia in the pediatric population. Intraoperative complications were <10%, and they occurred mostly at the beginning of our experience. Residual dysphagia occurred in about 16% of cases. The use of the new hemostatic devices seems to reduce the length of surgery and intraoperative bleeding. Considering the rarity of this pathology, we believe that patients with achalasia have to be treated only at centers with a strong experience in the treatment of this pathology.",yqg4hq8g

METHODS Twenty-two out of 27 consecutive patients with PSS received PMT using the Trellis-8 peripheral infusion system (Covidien) between 2010 and 2014. Subsequent surgery was performed in 18 of those patients, 9 patients were treated with thoracoscopic, 7 patients with subclavicular, and 2 patients with transaxillary first rib resection, 4 patients were treated with PMT and anticoagulation alone. Technical success, complications, and patency were registered. RESULTS PMT was successful in 21 (95 %) patients; 1 patient with unsatisfactory lysis received further catheter-directed thrombolysis, which, however, did not improve the result. The mean endovascular procedure time was 105 ± 33 min (range 70-200 min), and the required median amount of thrombolytic agent was 500,000 international unit (IU; range 250,000-1,000,000 IU). Adjunctive balloon venoplasty and aspiration were used in 18 (82 %) and 7 (32 %) cases, respectively. One patient had an intimal tear of the subclavian vein that was discovered and repaired during surgery. There were no other complications related to the endovascular procedure. At follow-up, 18 of 21 patients (86 %) with follow-up imaging available had patent subclavian vein, and all except 1 of the 22 patients were asymptomatic. The mean follow-up time was 25 ± 17 months. CONCLUSIONS In experienced hands, PMT is effective for early thrombus removal in PSS. Surgical decompression must be considered after PMT.",g9lfmwda

The potential benefits and complications of both techniques remain unclear when used together. Our aim was to assess the safety and long-term angiographic outcomes of stenting after BAC. METHODS Retrospective review of 87 unruptured wide necked aneurysms (in 80 patients) treated with BAC and requiring stent placement at the final stage of the procedure due to coil prolapse. Aneurysm characteristics, technical issues, clinical records, and MR results were assessed. Post-treatment and follow-up angiograms were evaluated by two independent reviewers and categorized as ""stable,"" ""further thrombosis,"" or ""recanalization."" RESULTS The mean maximum diameter was 9.1 ± 4.7 mm and aspect ratio 1.20 ± 0.47. Complete and near-complete initial occlusion were observed in 53 (60.9%) and 28 (32.2%) of all treated aneurysms, respectively. Angiographic follow-up (80 aneurysms; mean, 34.68 ± 25.26 months) revealed stability and further thrombosis in 92.4% (74/80). Recanalization was observed in six cases (7.5%, 6/83), four of which were retreated. No significantly different outcomes were found in terms of aneurysm size (p = 0.641). Transient and reversible procedure-related complications occurred in eight (9.2%), minor permanent deficits in 2.3%, and major deficits, including death, in four cases (4.6%). CONCLUSION Our results suggest that treatment of wide-necked aneuryms with stent placement after BAC yields low recanalization rates and enhanced angiographic outcomes in long-term follow-up.",vabce0mw

Early restoration of venous patency and preservation of valvular function by endovascular surgery has been advocated. The aim of this study was to review the efficacy and safety of percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy (PMT) against catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) in the treatment of acute iliofemoral DVT. METHODS Three hundred sixty-nine articles were identified through screening of the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases from January 2006 to December 2016. RESULTS Fifteen retrospective studies and one prospective registry, totalling 1170 patients, were recruited for qualitative synthesis. The venous patency rate ranged from 75% to 100% with mean follow-up of 12.3 months. The rates of PTS and recurrent DVT were less than 17% and 15%, respectively. The overall mortality rate was 0.26%. Compared with CDT, PMT was shown to reduce PTS at 1 year (Villalta score: 2.1 ± 3.0 in the PMT group and 5.1 ± 4.1 in the CDT group, P=0.03) and bleeding complications (packed cells transfused: 0.2 ± 0.3 units in the pharmacomechanical thrombectomy group and 1.2 ± 0.7 units in the CDT group, P<0.05). CONCLUSION Percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy is a safe and effective treatment for acute iliofemoral DVT in terms of restoration of venous patency, prevention of DVT recurrence, and PTS. Compared with CDT alone, PMT offers a lower risk of PTS and bleeding complications.",we82ko10

We report our experience with robotic first-rib resection. METHODS Patients diagnosed with Paget-schroetter syndrome underwent thrombolysis followed by robotic first-rib resection. The diagnosis was made by preoperative venography (VA) and magnetic resonance venography. The robot was used to dissect the first rib, disarticulate the costosternal joint and divide the scalene muscles. Success of the first-rib resection was assessed by physical examination, venogram and magnetic resonance venography. RESULTS Eighty-three robotic first-rib resections were performed (49 men and 34 women). The mean age of the patients was 24 years ± 8.5 years. The operative time was 127.6 min ± 20.8 min. The median hospitalization was 4 days. There were no surgical complications, neurovascular injuries or mortality. Patients with a patent subclavian vein on the postoperative venogram (57 of 83 patients, 69%) were anticoagulated with warfarin for 3 months. In the remaining 27 patients with a persistent postoperative occlusion of the subclavian vein, 21 (21 of 83 patients, 24%) underwent angioplasty and were anticoagulated with warfarin for 3 months, and 6 (6 of 83, 7%) required stent placement to achieve complete vein patency. Patients who underwent stent placement received antiplatelet therapy in addition to warfarin anticoagulation for 3 months. At a median follow-up of 24 months, all patients had an open subclavian vein with a patency rate of 100%. CONCLUSIONS The robotic transthoracic first-rib resection is feasible and allows for a minimally invasive resection of the first rib, while minimizing neurovascular complications.",5sjrqvf1

A literature review was undertaken to determine the feasibility and safety of TIPS in the treatment of PVT. All studies in which TIPS was attempted in patients with PVT were identified by searching through the PUBMED and MEDLINE databases. A total of 424 PVT patients undergoing TIPS were reported in 54 articles. The success rate of TIPS insertion was 67–100% in 19 case series. Further, 85 patients with portal cavernoma underwent successful TIPS insertions. Three therapeutic strategies of TIPS placement were used: (1) TIPS placement followed by portal vein recanalization via the shunt, (2) portal vein recanalization via percutaneous approaches followed by TIPS placement, and (3) TIPS insertion between a hepatic vein and a large collateral vessel without portal vein recanalization. Four approaches were used to access the portal vein: transjugular, transhepatic, transsplenic, and transmesenteric. Intra-abdominal hemorrhage secondary to hepatic capsule perforation was lethal in only three patients. No episode of pulmonary embolism was reported. Other procedure-related complications were reversible. The overall incidence of shunt dysfunction and hepatic encephalopathy was 8–33% and 0–50%, respectively. In conclusion, the reviewed studies uniformly support the feasibility and safety of TIPS for PVT even in the presence of portal cavernoma.

We assessed the incidence of hepatic abscess after thermal ablation in a BEA cohort treated with extended antibiotic regimens following ablation. MATERIALS AND METHODS Retrospective review was performed to identify patients with BEA who underwent percutaneous hepatic thermal ablation between January 1, 2003-September 1, 2016. Fifteen patients with BEA underwent 18 percutaneous thermal ablation procedures. Patient and procedural characteristics were reviewed, as well as the antibiotic regiment utilized post ablation. Complications were characterized via standardized nomenclature [Common Terminology for Clinically Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.03]. RESULTS Fifteen patients with BEA underwent treatment of 49 liver lesions during 18 ablation sessions. Mean follow-up in these patients was 39 months (range 3-138 months). Two patients (11%) developed hepatic abscesses, both of which occurred within 45 days of the ablation procedure while the patients were still on extended prophylactic antibiotic therapy. No additional CTCAE clinically significant complications were observed. CONCLUSION Thermal ablation of hepatic tumors can be accomplished safely in patients with BEA. Long-term post-procedural antibiotics may mitigate the risk of hepatic abscess formation. Due to the high number of patients who are deemed surgically unresectable, patients with BEA may have limited alternate treatment modalities and percutaneous hepatic thermal ablative treatments warrant consideration.",6yiqo5li

A new type of bioactive coil, the polyglycolic/polylactic acid-covered platinum microfilaments Nexus coil (ev3/Covidien, Irvine, CA, USA), has been proposed. The objective is to evaluate the safety and short-term and mid-term efficacy of Nexus coils in the endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms. METHODS The ENDECOR (European Nexus Detachable Coil Registry) is the first prospective, consecutive, multicenter non-randomized registry. After providing informed consent, 390 patients (238 women and 152 men; mean age, 51.6 years) with 404 ruptured or unruptured aneurysms were enrolled at 34 centers. Treatment was performed with at least 75 % of coil length as Nexus coils. Clinical and technical complications were systematically reported. An independent core laboratory evaluated angiographic results by using the Raymond Grading Scale. RESULTS Complete occlusion was seen in 181 aneurysms (48 %); neck remnant in 86 aneurysms (22 %) and aneurysm remnant in 111 aneurysms (30 %). Technical and clinical complications related to the procedure occurred in 33 patients (8.5 %). At discharge, overall mortality and permanent-morbidity were 4.1 % (16/390) and 5.6 % (14/251), respectively. Angiographic mean follow-up of 13.3 months was obtained in 233 of 390 patients (64.4 %) harboring 247 aneurysms. Recanalization was observed in 44 aneurysms (17.7 %), and progressive thrombosis was observed in 53 aneurysms (21.6 %). CONCLUSIONS Endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms with Nexus coils was associated with low morbidity and mortality rates. Efficacy of Nexus coils was comparable to published series of intracranial aneurysms treated with bare platinum coils, but their efficacy to prevent aneurysm recanalization was not demonstrated.",krzrboud

Single-dose parenteral prophylactic antibiotics as advised by current guidelines decrease the infection rate to 9-15%. We assume a prolonged effect of local antibiotic treatment with antibacterial gauzes. This study is the first to describe the effect of antibacterial gauzes in preventing infections in PEG without the use of antibiotics. METHODS A retrospective data analysis was carried out of all patients with PEG insertion between January 2009 and October 2014 in the Catharina Hospital Eindhoven. Data include placement and the period of the first 2 weeks after PEG placement, and long-term follow-up. All patients received a locally applied antibacterial gauze polyhexamethylene biguanide immediately following PEG insertion for 3 days. No other antibiotics were administered. The main outcomes were wound infection, peritonitis, and necrotizing fasciitis; secondary outcomes included other complications. RESULTS A total of 331 patients with only antibacterial gauzes were analyzed. The total number of infections 2 weeks after PEG insertion was 9.4%, including 8.2% minor and 1.2% major infections (peritonitis). No wound infection-related mortality or bacterial resistance was found. Costs are five times lower than antibiotics, and gauzes are more practical and patient friendly for use.

Minimally invasive laparoscopic resection has been used recently in liver surgery for treating selected hepatic hemangiomas. However, laparoscopic liver surgery poses the significant technical challenges and high rate of conversion. Radiofrequency (RF) ablation has been proved feasible in the treatment of hepatic hemangiomas with a size range of 5.0-9.9 cm. It is controversial to treat giant hepatic hemangiomas (≥10.0 cm) by means of RF ablation, due to the low technique success rate and high incidence of ablation-related complications. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of combined laparoscopic resection with intratumoral RF-induced coagulation for giant hepatic hemangiomas. METHODS We treated 2 patients with giant subcapsular hepatic hemangioma (12.0 cm and 13.1 cm in diameters respectively) by laparoscopic resection following intratumoral coagulation of the tumor with RF ablation. RESULTS Blood loss during resection was 100 ml (case 1) and 300ml (case 2) respectively. No blood transfusion and dialysis were needed during perioperative period. The two patients were discharged 6 days (case 1) and 12 days (case 2) after surgery without any complications, respectively. Postoperative contrast-enhanced CT follow up showed there was no residual tumor. CONCLUSIONS It is feasible to treat giant subcapsular hepatic hemangioma by laparoscopic tumor resection boosted by intratumoral coagulation using RF ablation, which may open a new avenue for treating giant hemangioma.",8azab9g9

METHODS: Twelve patients with cDGS underwent transplantation with allogeneic cultured thymus. OBJECTIVE: We sought to confirm and extend the results previously obtained in a single center. RESULTS: Two patients died of pre-existing viral infections without having thymopoiesis, and 1 late death occurred from autoimmune thrombocytopenia. One infant had septic shock shortly after transplantation, resulting in graft loss and the need for a second transplant. Evidence of thymopoiesis developed from 5 to 6 months after transplantation in 10 patients. Median circulating naive CD4 counts were 44 × 10(6)/L (range, 11-440 × 10(6)/L) and 200 × 10(6)/L (range, 5-310 × 10(6)/L) at 12 and 24 months after transplantation and T-cell receptor excision circles were 2,238/10(6) T cells (range, 320-8,807/10(6) T cells) and 4,184/10(6) T cells (range, 1,582-24,596/10(6) T cells). Counts did not usually reach normal levels for age, but patients were able to clear pre-existing infections and those acquired later. At a median of 49 months (range, 22-80 months), 8 have ceased prophylactic antimicrobials, and 5 have ceased immunoglobulin replacement. Histologic confirmation of thymopoiesis was seen in 7 of 11 patients undergoing biopsy of transplanted tissue, including 5 showing full maturation through to the terminal stage of Hassall body formation. Autoimmune regulator expression was also demonstrated. Autoimmune complications were seen in 7 of 12 patients.

The Solitaire AB stent (Covidien, Irvine, California), the only fully retrieved stent, assists in the coiling of wide-neck intracranial aneurysms. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the mid-term angiographic follow-up of wide-necked aneurysms treated with the Solitaire AB stent. METHODS SOLARE (SOLitaire Aneurysm Remodeling) is a consecutive, prospective study conducted in 7 European centers. A core laboratory evaluated the postoperative and mid-term (6 month ± 15 days) angiographic results by using the Raymond classification Scale. Recanalization was defined as worsening, and progressive thrombosis was defined as improvement in the Raymond scale score. RESULTS The mean width of the aneurysm sac was 7.5 mm, and the mean diameter of the aneurysm neck was 4.7 mm. Angiographic mid-term follow-up was obtained in 55 of 65 aneurysms (85.9%). Complete occlusion was achieved in 33 aneurysms (60%); a neck remnant was seen in 16 aneurysms (29.1%) and an aneurysm remnant in 6 aneurysms (10.9%). Of 55 aneurysms, recanalization was observed in 8 aneurysms (14.5%), and progressive thrombosis was observed in 17 aneurysms (30.9%). No bleeding or rebleeding was observed during the follow-up period. CONCLUSION Stent-assisted coiling of wide-necked intracranial aneurysms was found to be safe and effective with the Solitaire AB stent at 6-month follow-up. Angiographic results improve with time due to progressive thrombosis of the aneurysm.",jzntz4el

American journal of neuroradiology,Risk Factors for Hemorrhagic Complications following Pipeline Embolization Device Treatment of Intracranial Aneurysms: Results from the International Retrospective Study of the Pipeline Embolization Device.," AND PURPOSE Spontaneous intraparenchymal hemorrhage is a dreaded complication of unknown etiology following flow-diversion treatment. Using the International Retrospective Study of the Pipeline Embolization Device registry, we studied demographic, aneurysm, and procedural characteristics associated with intraparenchymal hemorrhage following Pipeline Embolization Device treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS We identified patients in the International Retrospective Study of the Pipeline Embolization Device registry with intraparenchymal hemorrhage unrelated to index aneurysm rupture post-Pipeline Embolization Device treatment. The rate of intraparenchymal hemorrhage was determined by baseline demographics, comorbidities, aneurysm characteristics, and procedural characteristics (including anticoagulation use, platelet testing, number of devices used, sheaths, catheters, and guidewires). Categoric variables were compared with χ(2) testing, and continuous variables were compared with the Student t test. RESULTS Of 793 patients with 906 aneurysms, 20 (2.5%) had intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Fifteen intraparenchymal hemorrhages (75.0%) occurred within 30 days of treatment (median, 5 days; range, 0-150 days). Nine patients with intraparenchymal hemorrhage (45.0%) died, 10 (50.0%) had major neurologic morbidity, and 1 had minor neurologic morbidity (5.0%). Intraparenchymal hemorrhage was ipsilateral to the Pipeline Embolization Device in 16 patients (80%) and contralateral in 3 patients (15.0%). Variables associated with higher odds of intraparenchymal hemorrhage included treatment of ruptured aneurysms (OR, 4.44; 95% CI, 1.65-11.94; P = .005) and the use of ≥ 3 Pipeline Embolization Devices (OR, 4.10; 95% CI, 1.34-12.58; P = .04). The Shuttle sheath was not associated with intraparenchymal hemorrhage (OR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.38-2.45; P = .95). CONCLUSIONS Spontaneous intraparenchymal hemorrhage following Pipeline Embolization Device treatment is a rare-but-devastating complication, with nearly all patients having morbidity or mortality. Variables associated with intraparenchymal hemorrhage included the use of multiple Pipeline Embolization Devices and treatment of ruptured aneurysms. The Shuttle, a device that was previously thought to be associated with intraparenchymal hemorrhage, was not associated with it.",o0e363e1

The goal of this update is to discuss current practices concerning antithrombosis prophylaxis and the management of recently developed anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents. The duration of prophylaxis is 1 month for oncological surgery. The recommended doses in bariatric surgery are twice daily injections of low-molecular weight heparin without exceeding a total dose of 10,000 IU/day. Dual antiplatelet therapy is necessary for 6 weeks after placement of bare-metal stents, from 6-12 months for drug-eluting stents, and 12 months after an acute coronary artery syndrome. Abrupt discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy exposes the patient to an increased risk of thrombosis. Data are insufficient to make specific recommendations for antiplatelet therapy in gastrointestinal surgery. For major digestive surgery, prescription of daily aspirin should be discussed case by case. If discontinuation of treatment is absolutely necessary, this should be as short as possible (aspirin: 3 days, ticagrelor and clopidogrel: 5 days, prasugrel: 7 days). The modalities for elective management of new oral anticoagulants are similar to those for classical vitamin K antagonists (VKA) therapy, except that any overlapping with heparin administration must be avoided. In the emergency setting, an algorithm can be proposed depending on the drug, the available coagulation tests and the interval before performing surgery.",9yvtq5ib

We compared a paclitaxel-coated balloon with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) for the treatment of symptomatic superficial femoral and popliteal artery disease. METHODS AND RESULTS The IN.PACT SFA Trial is a prospective, multicenter, single-blinded, randomized trial in which 331 patients with intermittent claudication or ischemic rest pain attributable to superficial femoral and popliteal peripheral artery disease were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to treatment with DCB or PTA. The primary efficacy end point was primary patency, defined as freedom from restenosis or clinically driven target lesion revascularization at 12 months. Baseline characteristics were similar between the 2 groups. Mean lesion length and the percentage of total occlusions for the DCB and PTA arms were 8.94 ± 4.89 and 8.81 ± 5.12 cm (P=0.82) and 25.8% and 19.5% (P=0.22), respectively. DCB resulted in higher primary patency versus PTA (82.2% versus 52.4%; P<0.001). The rate of clinically driven target lesion revascularization was 2.4% in the DCB arm in comparison with 20.6% in the PTA arm (P<0.001). There was a low rate of vessel thrombosis in both arms (1.4% after DCB and 3.7% after PTA [P=0.10]). There were no device- or procedure-related deaths and no major amputations. CONCLUSIONS In this prospective, multicenter, randomized trial, DCB was superior to PTA and had a favorable safety profile for the treatment of patients with symptomatic femoropopliteal peripheral artery disease.

Paclitaxel-eluting balloon (PEB) angioplasty, stenting, and directional atherectomy (DA) have provided new options for the treatment of superficial femoral artery disease; however, the comparative efficacy of these interventional strategies remains uncertain. METHODS One hundred and fifty-five patients with symptomatic peripheral artery disease due to de novo superficial femoral artery stenotic or occlusive lesions were randomized to treatment with plain balloon angioplasty (BA) followed by PEB angioplasty and stenting (n=48), BA and stenting (n=52), or DA with distal protection and bailout stenting (n=55). The primary end point of the study was percentage diameter stenosis after 6 months measured by angiography. Other end points included target lesion revascularization, thrombosis, ipsilateral amputation, binary restenosis, and all-cause mortality at 6 and 24 months. RESULTS Baseline and lesion characteristics were comparable in all groups with a mean lesion length of 65.9±46.8 mm and 56% total occlusions. At 6 months angiography, the percent diameter stenosis was significantly lower in patients treated by PEB angioplasty and stenting (34±31%) as compared with BA angioplasty and stenting (56±29%, P=0.009) or DA (55±29%, P=0.007). Similarly, binary restenosis was significantly lower after treatment with PEB and stenting as compared with BA and stenting or DA. Clinical follow-up at 24 months revealed a lower risk for target lesion revascularization after PEB angioplasty and stenting as compared with BA and stenting or DA. We found no difference in terms of target lesion thrombosis and mortality among groups, and no patient underwent amputation. CONCLUSIONS Treatment of de novo superficial femoral artery lesions with PEB angioplasty and stenting is superior to BA angioplasty and stenting or DA in terms of angiographic diameter stenosis at 6 months and target lesion revascularization at 24 months.

METHODS In this retrospective monocentric observational study, we included 95 patients treated for ilio-femoral PTVLs. We proposed a four-grade scale evaluating the severity of PTVLS caudal to the common femoral vein based on CT phlebography and per-operative phlebography. For most patients, venous patency was assessed with color duplex ultrasonography and the clinical efficacy of the intervention using the Villalta and CIVIQ scores. RESULTS Recanalization was successful in 100% of patients with a morbidity rate of 4%. After a mean follow-up of 21 months, the overall primary patency was 75%, the assisted primary patency 82%, and the secondary patency 93%. Secondary patency was 100% for grade 0-1, 90% for grade 2, and 63% for grade 3 (p < 0.002). There was no correlation between the extension of stenting caudally of the common femoral vein and venous patency. The mean improvements in the Villalta and CIVIQ-20 scores were, respectively, 4.6 (p < 0.0001) and 18 (p < 0.0001); scores were not correlated with the grade of PTVLs in the thigh. CONCLUSION Venous patency after endovascular treatment of ilio-femoral PTVLs was strongly linked to the severity of PTVLs caudal to the common femoral vein but not to the extent of stenting.",yo1wdyrl

The aim of the study was to retrospectively assess the efficacy and safety of Precipitating Hydrophobic Injectable Liquid (PHIL), a new nonadhesive liquid embolic agent, in the treatment of patients with cranial dural arteriovenous fistulas. The primary end point was the rate of complete occlusion of dural arteriovenous fistulas. Secondary end points included the incidence of adverse events and clinical status at 3-month follow-up. MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a retrospective multicenter study. Twenty-six consecutive patients with dural arteriovenous fistulas (de novo or previously treated) treated by injection of PHIL only or with PHIL in combination with other embolization products (such as Onyx or detachable coils) were included in the study. Recruitment started in August 2014 and ended in September 2015. RESULTS Twenty-two (85%) patients were treated with PHIL only, with 3 patients treated with both PHIL and Onyx, and 1, with both PHIL and coils. Immediate complete angiographic occlusion was achieved in 20 (77%) patients. Of the 6 patients with residual fistulas, 3 were retreated with PHIL and 1 achieved angiographic cure. An adverse event was seen in 1 patient who developed worsening of preexisting ataxia due to acute thrombosis of the draining vein. CONCLUSIONS PHIL appears to be safe and effective for endovascular treatment of cranial dural arteriovenous fistulas. Short-term angiographic and clinical results are comparable with those of Onyx, with the added advantage of easier preparation and improved homogeneous cast visualization. The use of iodine as a radio-opacifier also produces considerably less artifacts on CT compared with tantalum-based embolic materials.",mqg4pp8e

METHODS Consecutive cardiovascular surgery patients treated with post-dilution hemofiltration with RCA were included in this prospective observational study. The primary outcome of the study was CRRT circuit life-span adjusted for reasons other than clotting. The secondary outcome evaluated the influence of standard antithrombotic agents (acetylsalicylic acid [ASA], low molecular weight heparin [LMWH] or fondaparinux as thromboprophylaxis or treatment dose with or without ASA) on filter life. RESULTS Fifty-two patients underwent 193 sessions of CVVH, after exclusion of 15 sessions where unfractionated heparin was administered. The median filter life span was 58 hours. Filter life span was significantly longer in patients receiving therapeutic dose of LMWH or fondaparinux (79 h [2-110]), in comparison to patients treated with prophylactic dose of LMWH or fondaparinux (51 h [7-117], p < 0.001), and patients without antithrombotic prophylaxis (42 h [2-91], p < 0.0001). 12 bleeding episodes were observed; 8 occurred in patients receiving treatment dose anticoagulation, 3 in patients receiving prophylactic dose anticoagulation and 1 in a patient with no antithrombotic prophylaxis.

METHODS We searched PubMed until May 31, 2012, for randomized clinical trials using the following search items: atrial fibrillation, anticoagulation, warfarin, and previous stroke or transient ischemic attack. Studies had to be phase III trials in atrial fibrillation patients comparing warfarin with a non-VKA currently on the market or with the intention to be brought to the market in North America or Europe. Analysis was performed on intention-to-treat basis. A fixed-effects model was used as more appropriate than a random-effects model when combining a small number of studies. RESULTS Among 47 potentially eligible articles, 3 were included in the meta-analysis. In 14 527 patients, non-VKAs were associated with a significant reduction of stroke/systemic embolism (odds ratios, 0.85 [95% CI, 074-0.99]; relative risk reduction, 14%; absolute risk reduction, 0.7%; number needed to treat, 134 over 1.8-2.0 years) compared with warfarin. Non-VKAs were also associated with a significant reduction of major bleeding compared with warfarin (odds ratios, 0.86 [95% CI, 075-0.99]; relative risk reduction, 13%; absolute risk reduction, 0.8%; number needed to treat, 125), mainly driven by the significant reduction of hemorrhagic stroke (odds ratios, 0.44 [95% CI, 032-0.62]; relative risk reduction, 57.9%; absolute risk reduction, 0.7%; number needed to treat, 139). CONCLUSIONS In the context of the significant limitations of combining the results of disparate trials of different agents, non-VKAs seem to be associated with a significant reduction in rates of stroke or systemic embolism, hemorrhagic stroke, and major bleeding when compared with warfarin in patients with previous stroke or transient ischemic attack.",avpn7343

Patients were randomized to standard care or standard care + noradrenaline infusion. Low-dose noradrenaline improved intraoperative platelet aggregation and clot formation. Noradrenaline may be considered to improve intraoperative hemostasis during cardiac surgery. SUMMARY: Background New approaches to prevent bleeding complications during cardiac surgery are needed. Objective To investigate if noradrenaline (NA) enhances platelet aggregation in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Patients/Methods Twenty-four patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) were included in a prospective parallel-group randomized study. All patients but one were treated with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). In the treatment group (n = 12), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) was maintained at pre-induction levels by NA infusion. In the control group (n = 12), NA was administered only if MAP decreased below 60 mmHg. Platelet aggregation (impedance aggregometry with ADP, arachidonic acid [AA] and thrombin-receptor activating peptide [TRAP] as initiators) and clot formation (clotting time, clot formation time and maximum clot firmness by EXTEM, INTEM and FIBTEM tests with thromboelastometry) were assessed before and 50 min after anesthesia induction (before cardiopulmonary bypass was initiated). Results All patients in the treatment group received NA (median dose after 50 min 0.09 (range 0-0.26) μg kg-1 min-1 ). Four patients in the control group also received NA (0.03-0.12 μg kg-1 min-1 ). There were differences between the treatment group and the control group in ADP- and AA-induced aggregation changes (ADP, +16 [25th-75th percentiles, 5-26] vs. -7 [-19 to -1] U; AA, +12 [-4 to 16] vs. -9 [-13 to 1] U). INTEM maximum clot firmness increased in the treatment group but not in the control group. Conclusion Infusion of clinically relevant doses of NA enhanced platelet aggregation and clot firmness in ASA-treated CABG patients. NA infusion is hence a potential new method to acutely improve platelet reactivity in patients on antiplatelet therapy undergoing surgery.",3ozef29x

RESULTS Hemorrhagic complications occurred in 63 out of 4133 treatments (1.5%), including hemoperitoneum in 29 (0.7%), hemothorax in 14 (0.3%), and hemobilia in 20 (0.5%). Eleven, 8, and 4 of these patients, respectively, were categorized as major complications requiring blood transfusion or drainage. Two patients died after hemoperitoneum. Logistic regression analysis revealed large tumor size [odds ratio (OR) 1.06 per 1 mm increase in diameter] and low platelet count (OR 0.88 per 10,000/microL increase) were significant risk factors for hemoperitoneum. The location of tumor nodules was a significant risk factor for hemothorax (segment 7, OR 2.31) and hemobilia (segment 1, OR 3.30). Other factors, including the number of needle insertions or the duration of ablation, were not significant. CONCLUSIONS Although hemorrhagic complications were relatively rare with percutaneous RFA, specific treatments, such as blood transfusion and drainage, were required in some cases. Care must be taken, especially in high-risk patients.",o692zuj6

This study aimed to investigate the impact of heparin use during endovascular therapy of anterior circulation tandem occlusions on the functional and safety outcomes. METHODS A retrospective analysis of the multicenter observational TITAN registry was performed. Patients with anterior circulation tandem occlusion and treated with endovascular therapy (EVT) were included, with or without extracranial carotid intervention. We divided patients into two groups based on periprocedural heparin use (heparin vs. non-heparin). The dose of intravenous unfractionated heparin ranged from 1500 to 2500 I.U. Primary study endpoint was 90-day Modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Secondary study endpoint included angiographic and safety endpoints such as hemorrhagic complications. A propensity-score-matched analysis was performed. RESULTS Among 369 patients, heparin was used in 68 patients (18.4%). In the propensity-score-matched cohort, favorable outcome (mRS 0-2) occurred in 51.3% in heparin group and 58.0% in non-heparin group (matched OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.32-1.78; P = 0.52). Similar result was found in propensity-score-adjusted cohort (adjusted OR, 0.72; 95%CI, 0.39-1.32; P = 0.28). Likewise, there was no difference in the rate of successful reperfusion (mTICI 2b-3) (propensity-score-adjusted OR, 1.03; 95%CI, 0.50-2.09; P = 0.93) neither in safety endpoints between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS Periprocedural heparin use during EVT of anterior circulation tandem occlusions was not associated with better functional, angiographic or safety outcomes. These findings are applicable for low doses of heparin, and further studies are warranted.",ez7h89ta

METHODS Patients with stroke on treatment with a NOAC were prospectively enrolled in this multicentre observational study between February 2012 and 2015. Brain imaging at admission and follow-up imaging until day 7 were reviewed for HT. Functional outcome was assessed by the modified Rankin scale (mRS) before the index event, at discharge, and at 3-months. RESULTS 231 patients without recanalisation therapy (no-RT), and 32 patients with RT were eligible for analysis. Any HT was present at admission in 9/231 no-RT patients (3.9%, 95% CI 2.0 to 7.3) and in none of the patients with RT. In patients with follow-up imaging (no-RT, n=129, and RT, n=32), HT was present in 14.0% (no-RT; 95% CI, 8.9 to 21.1), and 40.6% (RT, 95% CI, 25.5 to 57.8), respectively. After adjustment for stroke severity, this difference between the no-RT and RT groups became non-significant. Symptomatic ICH was observed in 1 patient per group. HT was not associated with unfavourable outcome (mRS 3-6) at 3-months in multivariable analysis. Resumption of OAC after stroke was delayed in patients with HT compared to those without (15 d [IQR, 5-26] vs. 1 d [0-4], P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS The frequency and severity of HT after stroke on NOAC appears similar to previous reports for vitamin K antagonists and no anticoagulation. Whether asymptomatic HT should delay resumption of preventive anticoagulation requires further investigation.",yolk4hx7

METHODS Between 2004 and 2009, 33 patients (18 women; mean age 47 years) with iliofemoral DVT underwent pharmacomechanical thrombectomy using the AngioJet (n = 18) or Trellis (n = 15) devices with 10 mg of tenecteplase. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and venography were performed over the iliofemoral segments before and after treatment. Cross-sectional vessel and lumen diameters were measured from the IVUS scans and the post-procedure anteroposterior and lateral venograms at 3 points (proximal, mid-section, and distal) along each iliofemoral vein by 2 independent observers blinded to the treatment method. Volumes of the recanalized segments were calculated and compared to volumes of the original venous segments to assess clot lysis with each PMT device. IVUS scans and venograms were also compared for their ability to identify residual lesions or clot in need of treatment. Repeatability between and among observers was analyzed using the Bland and Altman method. RESULTS All procedures were successfully completed; there were only 2 minor bleeding complications. The mean volume of the recanalized segment was 2255+/-66 mm(3) by IVUS, representing 80% lysis of the clot compared to what was perceived as >90% lysis with venography (p<0.05). IVUS was able to delineate significant residual thrombus, stenosis, or May-Thurner anatomy requiring ancillary interventions in 100% of patients versus 48% (16/33) on the venograms (p<0.01). Quantitative assessments of the diameters of the involved venous segments from the venograms and IVUS were consistent between and among observers. Comparing the similar patient subgroups, AngioJet resulted in greater clot lysis (88%) versus the Trellis device (72%; p<0.01), corresponding to recanalized venous segment volumes of 2486+/-74 and 2025+/-57 mm(3) and total venous segment volumes of 2826+/-84 and 2813+/-79 mm(3), respectively. CONCLUSION IVUS is superior to venography for detection of residual thrombus and underlying venous pathology after pharmacomechanical thrombectomy.

The significance of delayed posttreatment residual flow occurring months after FD treatment is unknown. CASE DESCRIPTION A 76-year-old woman with a large intracranial aneurysm measuring 23.0 × 18.1 mm in the cavernous segment of the right internal carotid artery was treated with placement of a single FD (Pipeline Embolization Device, Covidien, Irvine, California, USA). Postprocedure digital subtraction angiography (DSA) demonstrated flow stagnation inside the aneurysm dome. The patient was discharged 9 days post procedure without new neurologic deficits. A 6-month follow-up DSA demonstrated delayed posttreatment residual flow into the aneurysm sac. Although she was scheduled for additional FD placement because of concern for aneurysmal rupture, the operation was not conducted due to an interim motor vehicle accident. Oral treatment with aspirin (100 mg/day) and clopidogrel (75 mg/day) was continued during her recovery. DSA performed 12 months post procedure showed that the aneurysm had completely thrombosed. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that delayed post-treatment residual flow into an aneurysm may form part of the normal clinical course post FD placement and may not preclude eventual thrombosis of the aneurysm. Larger studies are needed to determine whether more frequent follow-up DSAs after FD placement are necessary and whether all patients exhibiting delayed post-treatment residual flow into an aneurysm require additional FD placement or if watchful waiting is a more suitable course.",v2n9yedv

Our goal was to study the evolution of flow-diverter endothelialization and thrombus organization at different time points after flow-diverter treatment in giant fusiform aneurysms to better understand reasons for flow-diverter thrombosis and delayed aneurysm ruptures. MATERIALS AND METHODS Two giant anterior and 2 posterior circulation aneurysms, all of which had partially thrombosed before treatment, were studied. An unruptured, untreated posterior circulation aneurysm was used as a control. Each specimen was removed at 7 days or at 6, 9, or 13 months after flow-diverter treatment. The 3 patients who survived longer than 7 days were followed up by angiography and MR imaging. Formaldehyde-fixed paraffin-embedded sections were stained by using H&E, Van Gieson elastic, CD34, h-Caldesmon, and Picrosirius stains and studied by light microscopy. RESULTS According to angiography, aneurysms were found to be obliterated partially at 6 and 9 months and completely at 13 months. MR imaging revealed that mass effect remained unchanged in each case. Sections of the flow diverter within the normal parent artery were covered by an endothelialized fibrous layer as early as 6 months, but there was no tissue coverage or endothelialization seen even at 13 months inside the aneurysm itself. Each treated aneurysm had a thin wall with complete lack of smooth muscle cells. No signs of thrombus organization were found at any of the time points studied. CONCLUSIONS Endothelialization of the flow diverter in giant fusiform aneurysms may not occur and thrombus organization may not be initiated inside these aneurysms for as long as 1 year, which explains delayed flow-diverter thrombosis and the possibility of delayed ruptures.",o75j9nhm

A new type of bioactive coil, the polyglycolic/polylactic acid-covered platinum microfilaments Nexus coil (ev3/Covidien, Irvine, CA, USA), has been proposed. The objective is to evaluate the safety and short-term and mid-term efficacy of Nexus coils in the endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms. METHODS The ENDECOR (European Nexus Detachable Coil Registry) is the first prospective, consecutive, multicenter non-randomized registry. After providing informed consent, 390 patients (238 women and 152 men; mean age, 51.6 years) with 404 ruptured or unruptured aneurysms were enrolled at 34 centers. Treatment was performed with at least 75 % of coil length as Nexus coils. Clinical and technical complications were systematically reported. An independent core laboratory evaluated angiographic results by using the Raymond Grading Scale. RESULTS Complete occlusion was seen in 181 aneurysms (48 %); neck remnant in 86 aneurysms (22 %) and aneurysm remnant in 111 aneurysms (30 %). Technical and clinical complications related to the procedure occurred in 33 patients (8.5 %). At discharge, overall mortality and permanent-morbidity were 4.1 % (16/390) and 5.6 % (14/251), respectively. Angiographic mean follow-up of 13.3 months was obtained in 233 of 390 patients (64.4 %) harboring 247 aneurysms. Recanalization was observed in 44 aneurysms (17.7 %), and progressive thrombosis was observed in 53 aneurysms (21.6 %). CONCLUSIONS Endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms with Nexus coils was associated with low morbidity and mortality rates. Efficacy of Nexus coils was comparable to published series of intracranial aneurysms treated with bare platinum coils, but their efficacy to prevent aneurysm recanalization was not demonstrated.",krzrboud

Treatment should be considered for symptomatic patients or for those at risk for complications, especially retroperitoneal bleeding which is correlated to tumor size, grade of the angiogenic component and to the presence of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). This study reports our single-center experience with the use of selective arterial embolization (SAE) in the management of symptomatic and asymptomatic renal AMLs. METHODS In this retrospective mono-centric study, all demographic and imaging data, medical records, angiographic features, outpatient charts and follow-up visits of patients who underwent prophylactic or emergency SAE for AMLs between January 2005 and July 2016 were reviewed. Tumor size and treatment outcomes were assessed at baseline and after the procedure during follow-up. Computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or ultrasonography was used to evaluate AML shrinkage. Renal function was measured pre- and post-procedure. RESULTS Twenty-three patients (18 females, 5 males; median age, 45 years; range, 19-85 years) who underwent SAE either to treat bleeding AML (n=6) or as a prophylactic treatment (n=17) were included. Overall, 34 AMLs were embolized. TSC status was confirmed for 6 patients. Immediate technical success rate was 96% and 4 patients benefitted from an additional procedure. Major complications occurred in 3 patients and minor post-embolization syndrome (PES) in 14 patients. The mean AML size reduction rate was 26.2% after a mean follow-up was 20.5 months (range, 0.5-56 months), and only non-TSC status was significantly associated with better shrinkage of tumor (P=0.022). Intralesional aneurysms were significantly more frequent in patients with hemorrhagic presentation (P=0.008). There was no change in mean creatinine level after SAE. CONCLUSIONS SAE is a safe and effective technique to manage renal AMLs as a preventive treatment as well as in emergency setting, with significant reduction in tumor size during follow-up. A multidisciplinary approach remains fundamental, especially for TSC patients. In addition to size, the presence of intralesional aneurysms should be considered in any prophylactic treatment decision.",43qbks58

The current standard in these patients is acetylsalicylic acid, despite high prevalence of yet undetected paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Aim The ATTICUS randomized trial is designed to determine whether the factor Xa inhibitor apixaban administered within 7 days after embolic stroke of undetermined source, is superior to acetylsalicylic acid for prevention of new ischemic lesions documented by brain magnetic resonance imaging within 12 months after index stroke. Design Prospective, randomized, blinded, parallel-group, open-label, German multicenter phase III trial in approximately 500 patients with embolic stroke of undetermined source. A key inclusion criterion is the presence or the planned implantation of an insertable cardiac monitor. Patients are 1:1 randomized to apixaban or acetylsalicylic acid and treated for a 12-month period. It is an event-driven trial aiming for core-lab adjudicated primary outcome events. Study outcomes The primary outcome is the occurrence of at least one new ischemic lesion identified by axial T2-weighted FLAIR magnetic resonance imaging and/or axial DWI magnetic resonance imaging at 12 months when compared with the baseline magnetic resonance imaging. Key secondary outcomes are the combination of recurrent ischemic strokes, hemorrhagic strokes, systemic embolism; combination of MACE including recurrent stroke, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular death and combination of major and clinically relevant non-major bleeding defined according to ISTH, and change of cognitive function and quality of life (EQ-5D, Stroke Impact Scale). Discussion Embolic stroke of undetermined source is caused by embolic disease and associated with a high risk of recurrent ischemic strokes and clinically silent cerebral ischemic lesions. ATTICUS will investigate the impact of atrial fibrillation detected by insertable cardiac monitor and the effects of early anticoagulation with apixaban compared with antiplatelet therapy with acetylsalicylic acid on the incidence of new ischemic lesion after embolic stroke of undetermined source.",6taai8h0

Treatment discontinuation rates in vitamin K antagonist (VKA)-treated patients are high but may be lower with non-VKA oral anticoagulant agents. OBJECTIVES The goal of this study was to describe and explore predictors of dabigatran etexilate persistence in patients with newly diagnosed AF over 2 years of follow-up. METHODS Consecutive patients newly diagnosed with AF and ≥1 stroke risk factor were followed up for 2 years. Dabigatran nonpersistence was defined as discontinuation of dabigatran for >30 days. A multivariable Cox regression model included region as well as patient clinical and sociodemographic characteristics to explore predictors of nonpersistence. RESULTS Eligible patients (N = 2,932) took ≥1 dabigatran dose; their mean age was 70.3 ± 10.2 years, and 55.3% were male. The 2-year probability of dabigatran persistence was 69.2%. Approximately 7% switched to a factor Xa inhibitor and 6% to a VKA. Approximately one-third of dabigatran discontinuations were primarily due to serious or nonserious adverse events. Patients from North America had the highest discontinuation risk, and Latin America had the lowest. Minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic AF and permanent AF were associated with a lower risk for dabigatran nonpersistence. Previous proton pump inhibitor use was associated with a higher risk for dabigatran nonpersistence. CONCLUSIONS Probability of treatment persistence with dabigatran after 2 years was approximately 70%. Nearly one-half of the patients who stopped dabigatran switched to another oral anticoagulant agent. Patients from North America, and those with paroxysmal, persistent, or symptomatic AF, may be at a higher risk for discontinuing dabigatran.",9tb9564p

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy and safety of retrievable vena cava filters plus anticoagulation vs anticoagulation alone for preventing pulmonary embolism recurrence in patients presenting with acute pulmonary embolism and a high risk of recurrence. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized, open-label, blinded end point trial (PREPIC2) with 6-month follow-up conducted from August 2006 to January 2013. Hospitalized patients with acute, symptomatic pulmonary embolism associated with lower-limb vein thrombosis and at least 1 criterion for severity were assigned to retrievable inferior vena cava filter implantation plus anticoagulation (filter group; n = 200) or anticoagulation alone with no filter implantation (control group; n = 199). Initial hospitalization with ambulatory follow-up occurred in 17 French centers. INTERVENTIONS Full-dose anticoagulation for at least 6 months in all patients. Insertion of a retrievable inferior vena cava filter in patients randomized to the filter group. Filter retrieval was planned at 3 months from placement. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary efficacy outcome was symptomatic recurrent pulmonary embolism at 3 months. Secondary outcomes were recurrent pulmonary embolism at 6 months, symptomatic deep vein thrombosis, major bleeding, death at 3 and 6 months, and filter complications. RESULTS In the filter group, the filter was successfully inserted in 193 patients and was retrieved as planned in 153 of the 164 patients in whom retrieval was attempted. By 3 months, recurrent pulmonary embolism had occurred in 6 patients (3.0%; all fatal) in the filter group and in 3 patients (1.5%; 2 fatal) in the control group (relative risk with filter, 2.00 [95% CI, 0.51-7.89]; P = .50). Results were similar at 6 months. No difference was observed between the 2 groups regarding the other outcomes. Filter thrombosis occurred in 3 patients. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among hospitalized patients with severe acute pulmonary embolism, the use of a retrievable inferior vena cava filter plus anticoagulation compared with anticoagulation alone did not reduce the risk of symptomatic recurrent pulmonary embolism at 3 months. These findings do not support the use of this type of filter in patients who can be treated with anticoagulation. TRIAL REGISTRATION clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00457158.",otd3j630

Previous observational and randomized trials report conflicting results regarding the clinical significance of this pharmacological interaction. We examined the interaction between concomitant administration of PPI and clopidogrel on platelet reactivity and clinical outcomes in the large-scale, prospective Assessment of Dual AntiPlatelet Therapy With Drug-Eluting Stents study. METHODS AND RESULTS On-treatment P2Y12 platelet reactivity testing was performed using the VerifyNow assay after clopidogrel loading and successful drug-eluting stent implantation at 11 sites in the United States and Germany. PPIs were prescribed at the discretion of treating physicians; patients were followed for 2 years. High platelet reactivity was defined as P2Y12 reactivity units >208. Of 8582 enrolled patients, 2697 (31.4%) were taking a PPI at the time of coronary intervention. After adjustment for differences in baseline characteristics, PPI use was independently associated with high platelet reactivity (odds ratio, 1.38: 95% confidence interval, 1.25-1.52, P=0.0001). A total of 2162 (25.2%) patients were prescribed a PPI at hospital discharge. In a propensity-adjusted multivariable analysis, discharge PPI use was independently associated with increased risk for postdischarge major adverse cardiac events (cardiac death, myocardial infarction, or ischemia-driven target lesion revascularization) at 2-year follow-up (hazard ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.42, P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS In patients treated with clopidogrel after successful drug-eluting stents implantation, the concomitant administration of PPI was associated with high platelet reactivity and a greater rate of adverse outcomes during long-term follow-up. Additional studies are warranted to determine the risk-benefit ratio of PPIs in patients with drug-eluting stents treated with clopidogrel.

MATERIALS AND METHODS 39 patients (17 women and 22 men) with a total of 125 liver metastases were treated with percutaneous or intraoperative CEUS-guided MW ablation. The primary tumor was colorectal cancer (n = 31), breast cancer (n = 6), carcinoid tumor (n = 1), and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) (n = 1). The median number of metastases ablated in the 45 treatment sessions was 2 (range 1 - 11). The median size (maximum diameter) of the 125 metastases was 1.5 cm (range, 0.6 - 4.0 cm). Nineteen (15 %) of the 125 metastases were bigger than 2 cm. Metastases smaller than 2 cm were treated with a single needle, metastases bigger than 2 cm were treated with 2 or 3 parallel needles. RESULTS The 45 MW ablation sessions were performed percutaneously (n = 30), during laparotomy (n = 3), or during laparotomy combined with liver resection (n = 12). The 39 patients were followed up for at least 4 months with a median duration of 11 months (range, 4 - 20 months). The technical success rate was 100 %. The clinical effectiveness was 100 % with complete coverage of the metastasis by the avascular coagulation zone evaluated on immediate post-ablation CEUS. Local tumor progression (local recurrence) was seen in 12 (9.6 %) of the 125 treated metastases, and affected 10 (26 %) of the 39 patients. One major complication was observed in the form of a liver abscess that easily resolved after percutaneous drainage. Four minor complications were observed: Three cases of pain located at the puncture site and one case of ascites. CEUS was valuable in all phases of ablation including pre-ablation staging and procedure planning, placement of MW needles in the tumor, immediate post-ablation control of coagulation size, and finally in the long term follow-up regime.

Treatment has changed in recent decades from open surgery to management with flexible endoscopy, resulting in lower morbidity and mortality. The goal of this study was to present the largest series, with the longest follow-up, of patients with Zenker's diverticulum receiving outpatient treatment with flexible endoscopy using a diverticuloscope and Ligasure (Covidien, Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States), a device that allows tissue sealing and coagulation of vessels before cutting the septum between the diverticulum and esophagus. Patients and methods We performed 79 diverticulotomies in 69 patients (65.2 % male, mean age 73.4 years). The mean diverticulum size was 2.8 cm. In three cases with a diverticulum ≤ 1.5 cm, the diverticuloscope could not be placed. Results The technical success was 95.83 % and the clinical success 96.7 %: 84 % of the 56 patients followed for a mean of 34.6 months (24 - 64 months) had no dysphagia. The recurrence rate was 10.4 %, with a good response to a second diverticulotomy at 12 months (IQR: 11.5 - 17) in most cases.

METHODS AND RESULTS Five randomized controlled trials encompassing 10,350 patients were included. Primary efficacy and safety endpoints were all-cause death and major bleeding, respectively. All-cause death at 30 days did not significantly differ with bivalirudin compared to heparin (odds ratio (OR) 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74-1.28; P=0.84). Major bleeding was significantly reduced by bivalirudin compared to heparin (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.40-0.85; P=0.005). Bivalirudin use was associated with non-significantly different rates of 30-day definite stent thrombosis (ST) (OR 1.71, 95% CI 0.84-3.49; P=0.14), albeit with higher rates of acute ST (OR 3.55, 95% CI 1.67-7.56; P=0.001) and non-significantly different rates of subacute ST (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.46-1.61; P=0.64). There were non-significant differences in the 30-day rates of reinfarction (OR 1.47, 95% CI 0.94-2.30; P=0.10) and cardiovascular death (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.56-1.02; P=0.07). There were no significant interactions between bailout versus routine GPI use in the heparin arm for any of the safety or efficacy outcomes (all Pinteraction>0.10). CONCLUSIONS Bivalirudin compared with heparin was associated with comparable 30-day rates of mortality with reduced major bleeding, at the price of an increased risk of acute ST, with non-significant differences in the overall 30-day rates of ST and reinfarction. Intended use of GPI in the heparin arm did not significantly modify the treatment effects of bivalirudin. Given the important differences between trials, as well as evolution in technique and adjunct pharmacotherapy, further randomized trials are warranted to discriminate whether there are substantial safety and efficacy differences between these agents during primary PCI in STEMI.",m7hihuda

METHODS Multicentric retrospective series of patients with visceral aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms treated by means of stent graft. The following variables were analyzed: Age, sex, type of lesion (aneurysms/pseudoaneurysms), localization, rate of success, intraprocedural and long term complication rate (SIR classification). Follow-up was performed under clinical and radiological assessment. RESULTS Twenty-five patients (16 men), with a mean age of 59 (range 27-79), were treated. The indication was aneurysm in 19 patients and pseudoaneurysms in 6. The localizations were: splenic artery (12), hepatic artery (5), renal artery (4), celiac trunk (3) and gastroduodenal artery (1). Successful treatment rate was 96% (24/25 patients). Intraprocedural complication rate was 12% (4% major; 8% minor). Complete occlusion was demonstrated during follow up (mean 33 months, range 6-72) in the 24 patients with technical success. Two stent migrations (2/24; 8%) and 4stent thrombosis (4/24; 16%) were detected. Mortality rate was 0%. CONCLUSION In our study, stent-graft endovascular treatment of visceral aneurysmns and pseudoaneurysms has demonstrated to be safe and is effective in the long-term in both elective and emergent cases, with a high rate of successful treatment and a low complication rate.",chroxsox

Deciding to stop or continue anticoagulant therapy indefinitely after completing 3 to 6 months of initial treatment requires balancing the long-term risk of recurrent VTE if anticoagulation is stopped against the long-term risk of major bleeding if anticoagulation is continued. However, knowledge of the long-term risk for major bleeding events during extended anticoagulation in this patient population is limited. We plan to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to quantify the risk for major bleeding events during extended oral anticoagulation in patients with first unprovoked VTE. METHODS Electronic databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials will be systematically searched with the assistance of an information specialist (from inception to March 1, 2019) to identify randomized controlled trials and prospective cohort studies reporting major bleeding during extended oral anticoagulation in patients with first unprovoked VTE, who have completed at least 3 months of initial anticoagulant therapy. Study selection, risk of bias assessment, and data extraction will be performed independently by at least two investigators. The number of major bleeding events and person-years of follow-up will be used to calculate the rate (events per 100 person-years) with its 95% confidence interval for each study cohort, during clinically relevant time periods of extended anticoagulant therapy. Results will be pooled using random effect meta-analysis. DISCUSSION The planned systematic review and meta-analysis will provide reliable estimates of the risk for major bleeding events during extended anticoagulation. This information will help inform patient prognosis and assist clinicians with balancing the risks and benefits of treatment to guide management of unprovoked VTE.

The Contour device is designed to target the neck of an aneurysm and cause flow disruption within the aneurysm hence promoting thrombosis and neo-endothelialization at the neck. This article presents initial experiences with the Contour. METHODS The prospectively maintained database was retrospectively reviewed to identify patients treated with the Contour device. Demographic data, aneurysm characteristics, clinical result, and clinical and radiological follow-up information were recorded. RESULTS The review identified 3 patients (2 female), with 3 unruptured aneurysms, of average age 67 ± 8.7 years (range 62-77 years). The aneurysms were all located in the anterior circulation including one pericallosal, one at the A1-2 junction and one on the ICA bifurcation. The mean average dome height was 7.6 ± 0.62 mm (range 7.1-8.3 mm), dome width 5.7 ± 2 mm (range 3.5-7.5 mm), and neck width 3.6 ± 0.95 mm (range 2.5-4.2 mm). At follow-up angiography two of the aneurysms were completely occluded and one device had displaced into the aneurysm sac due to inappropriate positioning of the device. Of the patients one had minor stroke during the postoperative period but returned to baseline neurology. All patients were mRS 0 at last follow-up. CONCLUSION The Contour is a promising new aneurysm occlusion device. Further studies with longer term follow-up are required to determine the efficacy of this novel device.",bz6ep8s2

Patients were randomized to standard care or standard care + noradrenaline infusion. Low-dose noradrenaline improved intraoperative platelet aggregation and clot formation. Noradrenaline may be considered to improve intraoperative hemostasis during cardiac surgery. SUMMARY: Background New approaches to prevent bleeding complications during cardiac surgery are needed. Objective To investigate if noradrenaline (NA) enhances platelet aggregation in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Patients/Methods Twenty-four patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) were included in a prospective parallel-group randomized study. All patients but one were treated with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). In the treatment group (n = 12), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) was maintained at pre-induction levels by NA infusion. In the control group (n = 12), NA was administered only if MAP decreased below 60 mmHg. Platelet aggregation (impedance aggregometry with ADP, arachidonic acid [AA] and thrombin-receptor activating peptide [TRAP] as initiators) and clot formation (clotting time, clot formation time and maximum clot firmness by EXTEM, INTEM and FIBTEM tests with thromboelastometry) were assessed before and 50 min after anesthesia induction (before cardiopulmonary bypass was initiated). Results All patients in the treatment group received NA (median dose after 50 min 0.09 (range 0-0.26) μg kg-1 min-1 ). Four patients in the control group also received NA (0.03-0.12 μg kg-1 min-1 ). There were differences between the treatment group and the control group in ADP- and AA-induced aggregation changes (ADP, +16 [25th-75th percentiles, 5-26] vs. -7 [-19 to -1] U; AA, +12 [-4 to 16] vs. -9 [-13 to 1] U). INTEM maximum clot firmness increased in the treatment group but not in the control group. Conclusion Infusion of clinically relevant doses of NA enhanced platelet aggregation and clot firmness in ASA-treated CABG patients. NA infusion is hence a potential new method to acutely improve platelet reactivity in patients on antiplatelet therapy undergoing surgery.",3ozef29x

Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and venography were performed over the iliofemoral segments before and after treatment. Cross-sectional vessel and lumen diameters were measured from the IVUS scans and the post-procedure anteroposterior and lateral venograms at 3 points (proximal, mid-section, and distal) along each iliofemoral vein by 2 independent observers blinded to the treatment method. Volumes of the recanalized segments were calculated and compared to volumes of the original venous segments to assess clot lysis with each PMT device. IVUS scans and venograms were also compared for their ability to identify residual lesions or clot in need of treatment. Repeatability between and among observers was analyzed using the Bland and Altman method. RESULTS All procedures were successfully completed; there were only 2 minor bleeding complications. The mean volume of the recanalized segment was 2255+/-66 mm(3) by IVUS, representing 80% lysis of the clot compared to what was perceived as >90% lysis with venography (p<0.05). IVUS was able to delineate significant residual thrombus, stenosis, or May-Thurner anatomy requiring ancillary interventions in 100% of patients versus 48% (16/33) on the venograms (p<0.01). Quantitative assessments of the diameters of the involved venous segments from the venograms and IVUS were consistent between and among observers.

Studies have shown that thrombus resolution with catheter-directed thrombolysis in patients with iliofemoral DVT reduces postthrombotic morbidity, although patients unsuccessfully treated with catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) do not enjoy the same long-term benefit. The purpose of this study is to objectively assess whether the amount of clot reduction at the time of acute therapy correlates with long-term postthrombotic morbidity. METHODS Forty-two patients who underwent catheter-directed and/or pharmacomechanical lysis of iliofemoral DVT were quantitatively evaluated. Patients had their degree of clot lysis quantified and were divided into two main groups for comparison. Group I (n = 33) had >50% clot lysis (mean, 84%) and group II (n = 9) had < or =50% lysis (mean, 42%). At a mean follow-up interval of 14 months, the degree of chronic venous disease was assessed by evaluators blinded to the degree of clot lysis. Evaluation of postthrombotic morbidity was performed using the Villalta scale, and the clinical class of CEAP, and quality-of-life (QOL) was assessed using the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). RESULTS Mean CEAP scores were 0.85 and 3.13 (P = .005), and Villalta scores were 2.38 and 6.25 (P = .009) in group I and group II, respectively. Patient QOL in group I was higher than group II in all parameters. Physical functioning (P = .035), role physical (P = .012), general health (P = .014), vitality (P < .001), and social functioning (P = .012) were all significantly better in group I. Bodily pain (P = .117), role emotional (P = .624), and mental health (P = .096) strongly favored group I patients but did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION Patients with extensive DVT treated with catheter-based interventions to eliminate thrombus suffer relatively little postthrombotic morbidity. The degree of clot lysis directly correlates with long-term outcome. Improved QOL, the Villalta scale, and clinical class of CEAP are linearly correlated with the amount of clot resolution.",cm0mvbd5

We sought to analyze predictors of UE DVT resolution and hypothesized that anticoagulation will be associated with quicker UE DVT clot resolution and that CA UE DVT's whose catheters are removed will resolve more often than non-CA UE DVT's. METHODS All patients on the surgical intensive care unit service were prospectively followed from January 2008 to May 2010. A standardized DVT prevention protocol was used and screening bilateral UE and lower extremity duplex examinations were obtained within 48 hours of admission and then weekly. Computed tomography angiography for pulmonary embolism was obtained if clinically indicated. Patients with UE DVT were treated according to attending discretion. Data regarding patient demographics and UE DVT characteristics were recorded: DVT location, catheter association, occlusive status, treatment, and resolution. The primary outcome measure was UE DVT resolution before hospital discharge. Interval decrease in size on the subsequent duplex after UE DVT detection was also noted. UE DVTs without a follow-up duplex were excluded from the final analysis. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify independent predictors of UE DVT resolution. RESULTS There were 201 UE DVT's in 129 patients; 123 DVTs had a follow-up duplex and were included. Fifty-four percent of UEDVTs improved on the next duplex, 60% resolved before discharge, and 2% embolized. The internal jugular was the most common site (52%) and 72% were nonocclusive. Sixty-four percent were CAUEDVT's and line removal was associated with more frequent improvement on the next duplex (55% vs. 17%, p = 0.047, mid-P exact). Sixty-eight percent of UEDVTs were treated with some form of anticoagulation, but this was not associated with improved UE DVT resolution (61% vs. 60%). Independent predictors of clot resolution were location in the arm (odds ratio = 4.1 compared with the internal jugular, p = 0.031) and time from clot detection until final duplex (odds ratio =1.052 per day, p = 0.032). CONCLUSION A majority of UE DVT's are CA, more than half resolve before discharge, and 2% embolize. Anticoagulation does not appear to affect outcomes, but line removal does result in a quicker decrease in clot size.",2w3v8ds6

We hypothesized that human fibrinogen concentrate (FC) and prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), administered as combined therapy with TXA, would provide additive effects for reducing blood loss in an animal trauma model. METHODS Thirty-six pigs were subjected to 2 consecutive blunt liver injuries, resulting in severe hemorrhagic shock and coagulopathy. Intervention comprised saline (control group); TXA (15 mg kg, TXA group); TXA and FC (90 mg kg, TXA-FC); or TXA, FC, and PCC (20 U kg, TXA-FC-PCC). Blood loss, thromboelastometry (ROTEM), measures of thrombin generation, platelet activation, and global coagulation variables were monitored for 4 hours. Tissue sections were examined to determine the occurrence of thromboembolic events. RESULTS Total blood loss was similar in the TXA-FC and TXA-FC-PCC groups (mean ± SD: 1012 ± 86 mL and 1037 ± 118 mL, respectively; P = 1.000). These values were both lower (P < 0.001) than the TXA group (1579 ± 306 mL). Blood loss in all 3 intervention groups was lower (P < 0.001) than in the control group (2376 ± 478 mL). After trauma and resuscitation, but before study intervention, plasma fibrinogen levels were severely depleted (median for the whole study population: 66 mg dL; interquartile range: 51-108 mg dL) and clot strength was decreased (EXTEM whole-blood maximum clot firmness [MCF]: 53 ± 5 mm). Compared with controls, TXA inhibited fibrinolysis and stabilized MCF and clotting time. The addition of FC restored and stabilized hemostasis to a greater extent than TXA alone; the addition of PCC had no statistically significant impact on blood loss, clot strength (MCF), or clotting time, but it increased thrombin generation. There were no significant differences among the study groups regarding platelet activation. No thrombi or microthrombi were observed in any group at necropsy. CONCLUSIONS The early use of TXA and FC reduced blood loss and improved coagulation measurements in a porcine model of blunt liver injury and hemorrhagic shock. FC, administered in addition to TXA, was highly effective in reducing blood loss. The lack of statistically significant reduction in blood loss when PCC was added to TXA and FC may be attributable to the absence of thrombin generation impairment in this model.",t81ocp6w

We therefore evaluated PED cases complicated by acute thrombus formation at our institution, with an emphasis on identifying early angiographic signs that may portend this event. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively identified cases of acute thrombosis following PED placement in 100 consecutive procedures performed at our institution from a prospectively maintained clinical database. Angiographic findings were analyzed for early signs of acute thrombus formation. We also evaluated the efficacy of treatment of this complication with a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor (abciximab), as well as the results of pre-procedure platelet inhibition testing. RESULTS Acute thrombus formation was encountered in five patients following PED placement (5%). Early angiographic signs were present in all cases and included progressive stagnation of blood flow in covered side branches, occlusion of covered side branches, excessive stagnation of blood flow in the target aneurysm, as well as occlusion of the target aneurysm. These sequelae completely resolved following abciximab treatment in all five cases, with no permanent neurological morbidity or mortality. Four of the five patients had a pre-procedure P2Y12 value >200 (range 201-227). CONCLUSIONS Progressive stagnation or occlusion of covered side branches or target aneurysm are early angiographic signs of acute thrombus formation following PED placement and should prompt immediate treatment with a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor. Platelet inhibition testing may help identify those patients who are at an increased risk for this complication.",s9n8ukmk

A PSH is the most frequent complication after stoma formation. Symptoms may range from mild abdominal pain to life-threatening obstruction and strangulation. The treatment of a PSH is notoriously difficult and recurrences up to 20% have been reported despite the use of mesh. This has moved surgical focus toward prevention. METHODS Augmentation of the abdominal wall with a retro-muscular lightweight polypropylene mesh was compared with the traditional formation of a colostomy. In total, 150 patients (1:1 ratio) were included. The incidence of a PSH, morbidity, mortality, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness was measured after 1 year of follow-up. RESULTS There was no difference between groups regarding demographics and predisposing factors for PSH. Three out of 67 patients (4.5%) in the mesh group and 16 out of 66 patients (24.2%) in the nonmesh group developed a PSH (P = 0.0011). No statistically significant difference was found in infections, concomitant hernias, SF-36 questionnaire, Von Korff pain score, and cost-effectiveness between both study groups. CONCLUSION Prophylactic augmentation of the abdominal wall with a retromuscular lightweight polypropylene mesh at the ostomy site significantly reduces the incidence of PSH without a significant difference in morbidity, mortality, quality of life, or cost-effectiveness.",mgp71vtg

The aims were to assess the factors associated with blood clot structure and the impact of thromboembolus structure on MT using stent-retrievers in patients with acute large artery IS in the anterior circulation.Methods and Results:In an observational cohort study, we studied the components of intra-arterial clots retrieved from large cerebral arteries in 80 patients with acute IS treated with MT with or without i.v. thrombolysis (IVT). Histology of the clots was carried out without knowledge of the clinical findings, including the treatment methods. The components of the clots, their age, origin and semi-quantitative graded changes in the architecture of the fibrin components (e.g., ""thinning"") were compared via neuro-interventional, clinical and laboratory data. The most prominent changes in the architecture of the fibrin components in the thromboemboli were associated with IVT (applied in 44 patients; OR, 3.50; 95% CI: 1.21-10.10, P=0.02) and platelet count (OR, 2.94; 95% CI: 1.06-8.12, P=0.04). CONCLUSIONS In patients with large artery IS treated with the MT using stent-retrievers, bridging therapy with IVT preceding MT and higher platelet count were associated with significant changes of the histological structure of blood clots.",42vglg9p

Ultimately, one-third of patients with a parastomal hernia will need surgical correction due to frequent leakage or life-threatening bowel obstruction or strangulation. However, treatment remains a challenge resulting in high recurrence rates. Two single center trials demonstrated that the frequency of parastomal hernias decreases by prophylactic placement of a mesh around the stoma at the time of formation. Unfortunately, both studies were small-sized, single-center studies and with these small numbers less common complications could be missed which were the reasons to initiate a prospective randomized multicenter trial to determine if a retromuscular, preperitoneal mesh at the stoma site prevents parastomal hernia and does not cause unacceptable complications. METHODS One hundred and fifty patients undergoing open procedure, elective formation of a permanent end-colostomy will be randomized into two groups. In the intervention group an end-colostomy is created with placement of a preperitioneal, retromuscular lightweight monofilament polypropylene mesh, and compared to a group with a traditional stoma without mesh. Patients will be recruited from 14 teaching hospitals in the Netherlands during a 2-year period. Primary endpoint is the incidence of parastomal hernia. Secondary endpoints are stoma complications, cost-effectiveness, and quality of life. Follow-up will be performed at 3 weeks, 3 months and at 1, 2, and 5 years. To find a difference of 20% with a power of 90%, a total number of 134 patients must be included. All results will be reported according to the CONSORT 2010 statement. DISCUSSION The PREVENT-trial is a multicenter randomized controlled trial powered to determine whether prophylactic placement of a polypropylene mesh decreases the incidence of a parastomal hernia versus the traditional stoma formation without a mesh.

We assessed the incidence of hepatic abscess after thermal ablation in a BEA cohort treated with extended antibiotic regimens following ablation. MATERIALS AND METHODS Retrospective review was performed to identify patients with BEA who underwent percutaneous hepatic thermal ablation between January 1, 2003-September 1, 2016. Fifteen patients with BEA underwent 18 percutaneous thermal ablation procedures. Patient and procedural characteristics were reviewed, as well as the antibiotic regiment utilized post ablation. Complications were characterized via standardized nomenclature [Common Terminology for Clinically Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.03]. RESULTS Fifteen patients with BEA underwent treatment of 49 liver lesions during 18 ablation sessions. Mean follow-up in these patients was 39 months (range 3-138 months). Two patients (11%) developed hepatic abscesses, both of which occurred within 45 days of the ablation procedure while the patients were still on extended prophylactic antibiotic therapy. No additional CTCAE clinically significant complications were observed. CONCLUSION Thermal ablation of hepatic tumors can be accomplished safely in patients with BEA. Long-term post-procedural antibiotics may mitigate the risk of hepatic abscess formation. Due to the high number of patients who are deemed surgically unresectable, patients with BEA may have limited alternate treatment modalities and percutaneous hepatic thermal ablative treatments warrant consideration.",6yiqo5li

NSAIDs and anastomotic leakage.,"Anastomotic leakage (AL) is the most important and one of the most serious complications after colorectal resections with primary anastomosis. Any factors that contribute to increase the risk of AL should be identified and--if possible--eliminated. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are often used for treating pain after surgical procedures, among these also colorectal resections. The objective of this Ph.d. thesis was to investigate whether the use of NSAIDs in the postoperative period increases the risk of AL, and investigate the effect on pathophysiological mechanisms. In order to achieve this, the following studies were performed. Study I was a retrospective, case-control study in 75 patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal resection for colorectal cancer. 33 of these patients received the NSAID diclofenac in the postoperative period; the remaining 42 did not receive any NSAID. There were significantly more ALs among the patients receiving diclofenac (7/33 vs. 1/42, p=0.018). In uni- and multivariate logistic regression analyses, diclofenac was the only factor associated with increased AL rate. This study functioned as a hypothesis generating study and laid the ground for the subsequent studies. Study II was an experimental, randomized, case-control study in 32 Wistar rats. The rats had a colonic anastomosis performed and were randomized to diclofenac or placebo treatment. After three days, the rats were sacrificed and the anastomoses were harvested. First, the anastomotic strengths were tested by longitudinal; subsequently, the levels of the enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in the anastomotic tissues were measured. There was no difference among the groups with regard to anastomotic strength, but the animals treated with diclofenac had significantly lower COX-2 levels (median (range) 1.30 (0.42-3.31) ng/mg vs. 2.44 (0.88 - 18.94) ng/mg, p<0.001). This study showed that the used dose of diclofenac was sufficient and relevant, but did not show a direct damaging effect on the anastomoses due to NSAID treatment. Study III was also an experimental, randomized, case-control study. This time round, 60 Wistar rats were included. Again, colonic anastomoses were performed and the rats were randomized to diclofenac or placebo. Also, expanded polytetrafluoruethylene (ePTFE) tubes were placed under the skin of the rats. In this material, substituents of connective tissue accumulate and the amount of accumulation can be measured. After 7 days, the rats were sacrificed and, again, anastomotic strengths were measured along with collagen content in the ePTFE tubes. Anastomotic strength was similar in the two groups while collagen accumulation was significantly decreased among the rats treated with diclofenac (median (i.q.r.) 0.29 (0.13-0.47) vs. 0.47 (0.28-0.62) mcg/mg, p = 0.03). This study for the first time showed that NSAID inhibit subcutaneous collagen formation and that this formation is reversely correlated to anastomotic strength. This information can be used in further studies in this subject. Study IV was the final experimental case-control study in 40 Wistar rats. This time, in order to more easily extrapolate experimental results to daily clinical life, the colonic anastomoses were sutured with the same type of suture material as used in the clinical setting. Thus, half the anastomoses was performed with resorbable suture; the other half with non-resorbable suture. None of the rats received NSAID. The breaking strength was compared and found similar in the two groups. This study showed that experimental studies can be optimized in order to make comparisons and extrapolations to the clinical setting easier. Study V was a database study based on data from the Danish Colorectal Cancer Group's (DCCG) prospective database and electronically registered medical records. From the database information on demographic, surgical and postoperative variables (including AL) were provided. Information on NSAID consumption was retrieved by individual searches in the patients' medical records. Based on these data, uni- and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed. These analyses identified NSAID treatment in the postoperative period as an individual risk factor for AL. Other risk factors identified were consistent with the available literature. The detrimental effect of the NSAIDs are possibly due to an effect on collagen metabolism leading to weakened tissue around the anastomosis and/or on the risk of thrombosis formation leading to more thromboses in the vessels supplying the anastomosis, thereby limiting anastomotic blood flow. In conclusion, the studies included in this thesis have elucidated some of the physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms involved in anastomotic healing and leakage, and furthermore have shown that the use of NSAIDs in the postoperative period increase the risk of AL in patients undergoing colorectal surgery with primary anastomosis. Based on the findings in these studies, and based on existing knowledge, it is recommended that NSAIDs be abandoned after colorectal resection with primary anastomosis. It should be investigated whether the NSAIDs are also harmful to other types of anastomoses and after other surgical procedures where early tissue healing is crucial.",mtanqncf

Re-emergence of human infection with avian influenza virus H5N1 poses extra challenge to IV control. Artificial microRNA (amiRNA)-mediated RNA interference has become a powerful antiviral approach due to its high specificity and rapid effect. Here, we designed several amiRNAs targeting the hemagglutinin gene of H5N1, a major determinant of pathogenicity. Expression and delivery efficiency were enhanced by presenting functional amiRNA with chimpanzee adenovirus serotype 68 (AdC68). One amiRNA, HA-1405, significantly limited H5N1 replication in vitro and inhibited 96.7% of clade 2.3.2 replication. AdC68-conjugated HA-1405 treatment remarkably decreased different clades of H5N1 plaque formation in Madin–Darby canine kidney cells. Moreover, prophylactic administration with rAd(HA-1405) markedly alleviated clinical symptoms and reduced ~3- to 40-folds of lung viral RNA copies against four clades of H5N1 in Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice. Our results further showed that rAd(HA-1405) conferred 70 and 40% immediate protection against lethal clade 2.3.2 and clade 2.3.4 H5N1 challenge, respectively. In conclusion, these data provided information that HA-targeting amiRNA delivered by AdC68 could be pursued as a potential agent for highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses prevention.",oha0kfkz

The induction of anti-FVIII antibodies is a CD4(+) T cell-dependent process. Activation of FVIII-specific CD4(+) T cells is dependent on the presentation of FVIII-derived peptides on MHC class II by antigen-presenting cells. Previously, we have shown that FVIII-pulsed human monocyte-derived dendritic cells can present peptides from several FVIII domains. In this study we show that FVIII peptides are presented on immature as well as mature dendritic cells. In immature dendritic cells half of the FVIII-loaded MHC class II molecules are retained within the cell, whereas in LPS-matured dendritic cells the majority of MHC class II/peptide complexes is present on the plasma membrane. Time-course studies revealed that presentation of FVIII-derived peptides was optimal between 12 and 24 hours after maturation but persisted for at least 96 hours. We also show that macrophages are able to internalize FVIII as efficiently as dendritic cells, however FVIII was presented on MHC class II with a lower efficiency and with different epitopes compared to dendritic cells. In total, 48 FVIII core-peptides were identified using a DCs derived of 8 different donors. Five HLA-promiscuous FVIII peptide regions were found – these were presented by at least 4 out of 8 donors. The remaining 42 peptide core regions in FVIII were presented by DCs derived from a single (30 peptides) or two to three donors (12 peptides). Overall, our findings show that a broad repertoire of FVIII peptides can be presented on HLA-DR.",g91k3qdl

RESULTS: Two patients died of pre-existing viral infections without having thymopoiesis, and 1 late death occurred from autoimmune thrombocytopenia. One infant had septic shock shortly after transplantation, resulting in graft loss and the need for a second transplant. Evidence of thymopoiesis developed from 5 to 6 months after transplantation in 10 patients. Median circulating naive CD4 counts were 44 × 10(6)/L (range, 11-440 × 10(6)/L) and 200 × 10(6)/L (range, 5-310 × 10(6)/L) at 12 and 24 months after transplantation and T-cell receptor excision circles were 2,238/10(6) T cells (range, 320-8,807/10(6) T cells) and 4,184/10(6) T cells (range, 1,582-24,596/10(6) T cells). Counts did not usually reach normal levels for age, but patients were able to clear pre-existing infections and those acquired later. At a median of 49 months (range, 22-80 months), 8 have ceased prophylactic antimicrobials, and 5 have ceased immunoglobulin replacement. Histologic confirmation of thymopoiesis was seen in 7 of 11 patients undergoing biopsy of transplanted tissue, including 5 showing full maturation through to the terminal stage of Hassall body formation. Autoimmune regulator expression was also demonstrated. Autoimmune complications were seen in 7 of 12 patients.

Treatment of ophthalmic segment aneurysms with flow diverter devices also includes coverage of the ophthalmic artery but may result in complications. It is unclear, however, whether these devices mechanically block blood flow in the ophthalmic artery. Also unclear is the relationship between deployment of a flow diverter device and post-treatment occlusion. We studied hemodynamic changes in the ophthalmic artery after deployment of a flow diverter device to determine the relationship between those changes and post-stent occlusion of the artery. METHODS We analyzed hemodynamic modifications in the ophthalmic artery in 21 patients (19 women, 2 men; mean age 53.43 ± 7.32 years) treated by a single pipeline embolization device. Patient-specific geometries were determined from three-dimensional digital subtraction angiography and the stenting process was simulated. Computational fluid dynamics technology was used to analyze the change in ophthalmic artery hemodynamics. We compared pre-treatment and post-treatment flow velocity of the ophthalmic artery. RESULTS Among the 21 patients with aneurysms located in the ophthalmic segment, no ophthalmic artery occlusion was found during immediate or follow-up angiography. Post-stent flow velocity in the ophthalmic artery decreased from 0.35 ± 0.19 to 0.33 ± 0.20 m/s, with the difference not being statistically significant (P = 0.106). CONCLUSION Our results showed no significant change in ophthalmic artery blood flow after pipeline embolization device deployment. Hence, post-stent occlusion of the ophthalmic artery could not be explained by reduced blood flow. Delayed thrombosis and neointimal formation maybe the keys to ophthalmic artery occlusion and need further investigation.",2netxnbr

Anticoagulant treatments have demonstrated their efficacy in preventing VTE. However, when the bleeding risk is high, they are contraindicated, and mechanical devices are recommended. To date, mechanical prophylaxis has not been rigorously evaluated in any trials in ICU patients. METHODS In this multicenter, open-label, randomized trial with blinded evaluation of endpoints, we randomly assigned 407 patients with a high risk of bleeding to receive intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) associated with graduated compression stockings (GCS) or GCS alone for 6 days during their ICU stay. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of a VTE between days 1 and 6, including nonfatal symptomatic documented VTE, or death due to a pulmonary embolism, or asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis detected by ultrasonography systematically performed on day 6. RESULTS The primary outcome was assessed in 363 patients (89.2%). By day 6, the incidence of the primary outcome was 5.6% (10 of 179 patients) in the IPC + GCS group and 9.2% (17 of 184 patients) in the GCS group (relative risk 0.60; 95% confidence interval 0.28-1.28; p = 0.19). Tolerance of IPC was poor in only 12 patients (6.0%). No intergroup difference in mortality rate was observed. CONCLUSIONS With the limitation of a low statistical power, our results do not support the superiority of the combination of IPC + GCS compared to GCS alone to prevent VTE in ICU patients at high risk of bleeding.",cupke82n

The diameter of the saphenous vein should be considered before RFA because occlusion of the vein may differ depending on its diameter. Until now, however, there have been few data about the correlation between the diameter of the saphenous vein and the stump length after RFA. The purpose of our study was to investigate its correlation. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective review was performed from prospectively collected data of RFA patients between March 2009 and December 2011. Preoperatively, the saphenous vein diameter was measured. Ablation was initiated 2 cm distal from the junction. Postoperatively, stump length was measured at 1 week and 6 months. After 2 years, we measured the length from the saphenofemoral junction to the leading point of occlusion for great saphenous vein, and length from the saphenopopliteal junction to the leading point of occlusion for small saphenous vein. The paired t-test, independent t-test, and correlation analysis were used for statistical analysis. P-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS During the study period, RFA was performed in 201 patients. Endovenous heat-induced thrombosis developed in 3 patients (1.5%). After 2 years, the stump length was obtained in 74 limbs. The mean diameter and stump length of the saphenous vein were 6.7±1.8 mm and 12.5±8.5 mm, respectively. Correlation analysis showed that the Pearson correlation coefficient of these factors was -0.017.

METHODS All patients who underwent RFA of the GSV from 1 May 2013 to 30 September 2013 in eight of our vein centers were included. Duplex ultrasound scans (DUSs) were performed prior to treatment on all patients and 2-3 days, and 1 month after procedure. Demographic data, GSV diameters, and other relevant data were recorded. Clinical, Etiologic, Anatomic, Pathologic (CEAP) classification and Venous Clinical Severity Scores (VCSSs) were determined prior to ablation and one month later. Patients who developed endovenous heat induced thrombosis (EHIT) were followed till resolution. RESULTS A total of 205 patients had one cycle treatment (group A) and 204 had two cycle treatment (group B). The two groups were comparable in their demography, CEAP classification, and VCSS scores. The rate of failure of ablation and incidence of EHIT were also not significantly different. The incidence of complications was low, <5% in both groups and all were minor. CONCLUSION Two cycle treatment of the proximal GSV for vein ablation does not improve the success rate of vein closure in the short term, compared to one cycle treatment. It also does not increase the risks of DVT, EHIT, major bleeding, and other complications. However, we do not know at what diameter two cycles may be superior to one cycle.",urgheo10

We have used indocyanine green (ICG)-videoangiography to study intraoperatively the flow inside the SOV in two cases of indirect CCF. In this paper, we report the operative technique and the result of ICG videoangiographic-guided cannulation of the SOV for endovascular treatment of CCF. Two male patients, of 59 and 66 years of age respectively, presented at our Institution with right decreased visual acuity, persistent binocular diplopia and painful ophthalmoplegia, chemosis and proptosis, due to right unilateral indirect CCF fistula. The endovascular transvenous approach failed in one case due to thrombosis of the inferior petrosal sinus (IPS) and the extreme tortuosity of the angular vein. In the other case, it was considered unfeasible due to an unfavourable vascular angioarchitecture. For this reason, an ICG videoangiographic-guided cannulation of the SOV, followed by endovascular obliteration of the CCF, was performed. CCF was cured in both cases with this approach. No additional neurological deficits and no complications due to SOV cannulation were registered during the hospital stay. There were no fistula recurrences during the mean follow-up of 18 months. ICG-videoangiography is a simple, fast and cost-effective technique that can be reliably applied in SOV cannulation for subsequent indirect CCF embolization.",dd58eq5f

Alteplase is a recombinant tissue plasminogen activator that has been used to improve the function of catheters used for RRT in humans. OBJECTIVES To retrospectively review alteplase instillation in dysfunctional catheters used for RRT in dogs and cats. ANIMALS Seventeen dogs and 8 cats receiving RRT for kidney failure. METHODS Medical records of patients in which alteplase was used for RRT catheter dysfunction from 2004 to 2012 were retrospectively reviewed to characterize reasons for use, improvement in function, increase in blood flow, and duration of improvement. RESULTS Alteplase was instilled 43 times in 29 catheters, most commonly because of suspicion that the catheter would not provide sufficient flow on the next treatment (n = 21). The second most common reason was inability to start a dialysis treatment (n = 12). Catheter function improved after alteplase instillation in 34 of 43 treatments (79%). Median blood flow rate increased by 13% (18 mL/min) in the dialysis session after alteplase instillation. Seven of 29 catheters (24%) were treated with alteplase on >1 occasion (median time to second treatment, 8 days), and 1 catheter had to be replaced because of intractable dysfunction.

METHODS The TORPEDO trial was a randomized study to demonstrate superiority of PEVI in the reduction of the VTE and PTS at 6 months; in that trial, 183 patients (103 men; mean age 61 ± 11 years) with symptomatic proximal DVT were randomized to receive PEVI + anticoagulation (n = 91) or anticoagulation alone (n = 92). PEVI consisted of one or more of a combination of thrombectomy, balloon venoplasty, stenting, and/or local low-dose thrombolytic therapy. RESULTS At 6 months, recurrent VTE developed in 2.3% of the PEVI + anticoagulation group vs. 14.8% in the anticoagulation only group (p = 0.003); PTS developed in 3.4% vs. 27.2% (p<0.001), respectively. At a mean follow-up of 30 ± 5 months (range 12-41), 88 patients in the PEVI + anticoagulation group and 81 patients in the anticoagulation only group reached target follow-up. Recurrent VTE developed in 4 (4.5%) of the 88 PEVI + anticoagulation patients vs. 13 (16%) of the 81 patients receiving anticoagulation only (p = 0.02). PTS developed in 6 (6.8%) of the PEVI + anticoagulation group vs. 24 (29.6%) of the anticoagulation only group (p<0.001). CONCLUSION In patients with proximal DVT, PEVI is superior to anticoagulation alone in the reduction of VTE and PTS.

Early restoration of venous patency and preservation of valvular function by endovascular surgery has been advocated. The aim of this study was to review the efficacy and safety of percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy (PMT) against catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) in the treatment of acute iliofemoral DVT. METHODS Three hundred sixty-nine articles were identified through screening of the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases from January 2006 to December 2016. RESULTS Fifteen retrospective studies and one prospective registry, totalling 1170 patients, were recruited for qualitative synthesis. The venous patency rate ranged from 75% to 100% with mean follow-up of 12.3 months. The rates of PTS and recurrent DVT were less than 17% and 15%, respectively. The overall mortality rate was 0.26%. Compared with CDT, PMT was shown to reduce PTS at 1 year (Villalta score: 2.1 ± 3.0 in the PMT group and 5.1 ± 4.1 in the CDT group, P=0.03) and bleeding complications (packed cells transfused: 0.2 ± 0.3 units in the pharmacomechanical thrombectomy group and 1.2 ± 0.7 units in the CDT group, P<0.05). CONCLUSION Percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy is a safe and effective treatment for acute iliofemoral DVT in terms of restoration of venous patency, prevention of DVT recurrence, and PTS.

INDICATION anatomic or pathophysiologic indication includes venous diameter within 2-20 mm, reflux time ≥0.5 seconds and distance from the skin ≥5 mm or subfascial location. Access: it is recommended to access at or above the knee joint for great saphenous vein and above the mid-calf for small saphenous vein. Catheter placement: the catheter tip should be placed 2.0 cm inferior to the saphenofemoral or saphenopopliteal junction. Endovenous heat-induced thrombosis ≥class III should be treated with low-molecular weight heparin. Tumescent solution: the composition of solution can be variable (e.g., 2% lidocaine 20 mL+500 mL normal saline+bicarbonate 2.5 mL with/without epinephrine). Infiltration can be done from each direction. Ablation: two cycles' ablation for the first proximal segment of saphenous vein and the segment with the incompetent perforators is recommended. The other segments should be ablated one time. During RF energy delivery, it is recommended to apply external compression. Concomitant procedure: It is recommended to do simultaneously ambulatory phlebectomy. For sclerotherapy, it is recommended to defer at least 2 weeks. Post-procedural management: post-procedural ambulation is encouraged to reduce the thrombotic complications. Compression stocking should be applied for at least 7 days. Minor daily activity is not limited, but strenuous activities should be avoided for 2 weeks. It is suggested to take showers after 24 hours and tub baths, swimming, or soaking in water after 2 weeks.",6shnmxyf

The need for rapid treatment of this disease entity is without question; however, the best method for treatment is still undetermined. Here, we present our results using the stent-in-stent technique, without coiling, for these patients and propose that it is a viable treatment strategy. METHODS We identified in our local database for neurointerventional therapy, between 1st October 2000 and 1st January 2014, 93 patients with potential subarachnoid haemorrhage secondary to vertebrobasilar pathology. After review of the clinical notes and imaging, 15 were found to have presented with subarachnoid haemorrhage and treated with stents alone. All dissections were spontaneous with no history of preceding trauma. The ages ranged between 46 and 71 years (mean 61 years). RESULTS All patients presented with Fischer grade 4 SAH and had a visible pseudoaneurysm. The pre-operative GCS varied with two patients scoring 3, one patient scoring 6 and the remaining 12 patients scoring 8 or above. All cases were subjected to stent-in-stent treatment alone. We did not experience any intra-procedural complications. In our series, eight patients had full recovery with a Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) of 5, three had moderate disability (GOS 4), one had severe disability (GOS 3), and three patents died, one patient from stent thrombosis or re-bleeding and two from their initial SAH. CONCLUSION The stent-in-stent technique represents a viable reconstructive endovascular surgical technique with a low risk of intra-procedural complication and post-operative repeat haemorrhage.",l6heu683

Concomitant administration of antiviral agents has the potential to increase their plasma concentration. A series of patients managed in the Cremona Thrombosis Center were admitted at Cremona Hospital for SARS‐CoV‐2 and started antiviral drugs without stopping DOAC therapy. DOAC plasma levels were measured in hospital and results compared with those recorded before hospitalization. METHODS: All consecutive patients on DOACs were candidates for administration of antiviral agents (lopinavir, ritonavir, or darunavir). Plasma samples for DOAC measurement were collected 2to 4 days after starting antiviral treatment, at 12 hours from the last dose intake in patients on dabigatran and apixaban, and at 24 hours in those on rivaroxaban and edoxaban. For each patient, C‐trough DOAC level, expressed as ng/mL, was compared with the one measured before hospitalization. RESULTS: Of the 1039 patients hospitalized between February 22 and March 15, 2020 with COVID‐19 pneumonia and candidates for antiviral therapy, 32 were on treatment with a DOAC. DOAC was stopped in 20 and continued in the remaining 12. On average, C‐trough levels were 6.14 times higher during hospitalization than in the pre‐hospitalization period. CONCLUSION: DOAC patients treated with antiviral drugs show an alarming increase in DOAC plasma levels. In order to prevent bleeding complications, we believe that physicians should consider withholding DOACs from patients with SARS‐CoV‐2 and replacing them with alternative parenteral antithrombotic strategies for as long as antiviral agents are deemed necessary and until discharge.",inj2fxeo

OBJECTIVES To investigate the timing of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) onset secondary to spinal cord injury without anticoagulant therapies. SETTING Spinal Cord Injury Center in Hokkaido, Japan. METHODS Between November 2012 and June 2013, patients with spinal cord injury who were admitted to our hospital within 1 day after the injury and treated surgically within 24 h underwent a neurological examination, leg vein ultrasonography and D-dimer test 1, 3, 7, 14 and 28 days after surgery. All patients received treatment with intermittent pneumatic compression and elastic stockings, but without any anticoagulant. RESULTS DVT developed in 12 patients (11 men and 1 women), with a mean age of 62.2 years (range, 41-80 years; mean age of total sample, 63.2 years (range, 25-78 years)), all distal to the popliteal vein. DVT occurred more often with a more severe paralysis (66.3%, AIS A and B). The median (± standard error) length of time from the operation to DVT detection was 7.5±2.2 days. The mean D-dimer level upon DVT detection was 14.6±11.8 μg ml(-1), with no significant differences between those who developed DVT and those who did not at any of the time points. CONCLUSION These results suggest that DVT can develop at the very-acute stage of spinal cord injury and the incidence increases with a more severe paralysis. DVT detection was more reliable with ultrasonography, which should be used with DVT-preventive measures, beginning immediately after the injury, for the management of patients with spinal cord injury.",k2kxy525

A literature review was undertaken to determine the feasibility and safety of TIPS in the treatment of PVT. All studies in which TIPS was attempted in patients with PVT were identified by searching through the PUBMED and MEDLINE databases. A total of 424 PVT patients undergoing TIPS were reported in 54 articles. The success rate of TIPS insertion was 67–100% in 19 case series. Further, 85 patients with portal cavernoma underwent successful TIPS insertions. Three therapeutic strategies of TIPS placement were used: (1) TIPS placement followed by portal vein recanalization via the shunt, (2) portal vein recanalization via percutaneous approaches followed by TIPS placement, and (3) TIPS insertion between a hepatic vein and a large collateral vessel without portal vein recanalization. Four approaches were used to access the portal vein: transjugular, transhepatic, transsplenic, and transmesenteric. Intra-abdominal hemorrhage secondary to hepatic capsule perforation was lethal in only three patients. No episode of pulmonary embolism was reported. Other procedure-related complications were reversible. The overall incidence of shunt dysfunction and hepatic encephalopathy was 8–33% and 0–50%, respectively.

We compared a paclitaxel-coated balloon with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) for the treatment of symptomatic superficial femoral and popliteal artery disease. METHODS AND RESULTS The IN.PACT SFA Trial is a prospective, multicenter, single-blinded, randomized trial in which 331 patients with intermittent claudication or ischemic rest pain attributable to superficial femoral and popliteal peripheral artery disease were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to treatment with DCB or PTA. The primary efficacy end point was primary patency, defined as freedom from restenosis or clinically driven target lesion revascularization at 12 months. Baseline characteristics were similar between the 2 groups. Mean lesion length and the percentage of total occlusions for the DCB and PTA arms were 8.94 ± 4.89 and 8.81 ± 5.12 cm (P=0.82) and 25.8% and 19.5% (P=0.22), respectively. DCB resulted in higher primary patency versus PTA (82.2% versus 52.4%; P<0.001). The rate of clinically driven target lesion revascularization was 2.4% in the DCB arm in comparison with 20.6% in the PTA arm (P<0.001). There was a low rate of vessel thrombosis in both arms (1.4% after DCB and 3.7% after PTA [P=0.10]). There were no device- or procedure-related deaths and no major amputations. CONCLUSIONS In this prospective, multicenter, randomized trial, DCB was superior to PTA and had a favorable safety profile for the treatment of patients with symptomatic femoropopliteal peripheral artery disease.

The aim of the study was to retrospectively assess the efficacy and safety of Precipitating Hydrophobic Injectable Liquid (PHIL), a new nonadhesive liquid embolic agent, in the treatment of patients with cranial dural arteriovenous fistulas. The primary end point was the rate of complete occlusion of dural arteriovenous fistulas. Secondary end points included the incidence of adverse events and clinical status at 3-month follow-up. MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a retrospective multicenter study. Twenty-six consecutive patients with dural arteriovenous fistulas (de novo or previously treated) treated by injection of PHIL only or with PHIL in combination with other embolization products (such as Onyx or detachable coils) were included in the study. Recruitment started in August 2014 and ended in September 2015. RESULTS Twenty-two (85%) patients were treated with PHIL only, with 3 patients treated with both PHIL and Onyx, and 1, with both PHIL and coils. Immediate complete angiographic occlusion was achieved in 20 (77%) patients. Of the 6 patients with residual fistulas, 3 were retreated with PHIL and 1 achieved angiographic cure. An adverse event was seen in 1 patient who developed worsening of preexisting ataxia due to acute thrombosis of the draining vein. CONCLUSIONS PHIL appears to be safe and effective for endovascular treatment of cranial dural arteriovenous fistulas. Short-term angiographic and clinical results are comparable with those of Onyx, with the added advantage of easier preparation and improved homogeneous cast visualization. The use of iodine as a radio-opacifier also produces considerably less artifacts on CT compared with tantalum-based embolic materials.",mqg4pp8e

Specific patient populations, such as those with cancer and the critically ill, show elevated risk for VTE, bleeding or both, and significant gaps in VTE prophylaxis and treatment exist in these groups. Objective To present novel insights and consolidated evidence collected from experts, clinical practice guidelines and original studies on the unmet needs in thromboprophylaxis, and on the treatment of VTE in two high-risk patient groups: patients with cancer and the critically ill. Methodology To identify specific unmet needs in the management of VTE, a methodology was designed and implemented that assessed gaps in prophylaxis and treatment of VTE through interviews with 44 experts in the field of thrombosis and haemostasis, and through a review of current guidelines and seminal studies to substantiate the insights provided by the experts. The research findings were then analysed, discussed and consolidated by a multidisciplinary group of experts. Results The gap analysis methodology identified shortcomings in the VTE risk assessment tools, patient stratification approaches for prophylaxis, and the suboptimal use of anticoagulants for primary prophylaxis and treatment. Conclusions Specifically, patients with cancer need better VTE risk assessment tools to tailor primary thromboprophylaxis to tumour types and disease stages, and the potential for drug-drug interactions needs to be considered. In critically ill patients, unfractionated heparin is not advised as a first-line treatment option, and the strength of evidence is increasing for direct oral anticoagulants as a treatment option over low-molecular-weight heparins.",glq726i5

The aim of the present study was to make a detailed description of re-interventions after EVAR-including incidence, indications, procedures, and outcome-with special reference to non-access-related re-interventions. METHODS This is a retrospective single-center cohort study of re-interventions after standard EVAR with special reference to non-access-related re-interventions. Consecutive patients (n = 405) treated with standard EVAR for non-ruptured (n = 337) or ruptured (n = 68) infrarenal aneurysms between 2005 and 2013 were analysed. Median follow-up was 29 months (range 0-108). RESULTS Eighty-nine patients (22 %) underwent 113 re-interventions during follow-up. Twenty-seven patients (7 %) had 28 access related re-intervention, 65 patients (16 %) had 85 non-access related reinterventions. Non-access related re-interventions were more common in ruptured aneurysms than in unruptured aneurysms (22 vs. 15 %, p = 0.002). The most frequent indications were endoleak type I (n = 19), type II (n = 21), or type III (n = 5); stent graft migration (n = 9); and thrombosis (n = 14). The most frequent procedures were embolization of endoleak type II (n = 21), additional iliac stent graft (n = 19), proximal extension (n = 12), thrombolysis (n = 8), iliac limb bare-metal stenting (n = 6), and stent graft relining (n = 7). Endovascular technique was used in 83 % of re-interventions. Thirty-day mortality after non-access-related re-interventions was 15 % when initiated from symptoms (rupture or infection) and 0 % when initiated from follow-up findings (p = 0.014). Cumulative survival five years after EVAR was 72 % in patients with a re-intervention and 59 % in patients without (p = 0.21). CONCLUSIONS Non-access-related re-intervention rates are still considerable after EVAR and more frequent after ruptured aneurysms. Endoleak embolization is the most frequent procedure, followed by additional iliac stent grafts.

American journal of neuroradiology,Use of flow-diverting devices in fusiform vertebrobasilar giant aneurysms: a report on periprocedural course and long-term follow-up.," AND PURPOSE Fusiform vertebrobasilar giant aneurysms are a rare (<1% of all intracranial aneurysms) but challenging aneurysm subtype. Little data are available on the natural history of this aneurysm subtype and the impact of the use of flow-diverting stents on the long-term clinical and imaging follow-up. In this article, we present our experience with the treatment of fusiform vertebrobasilar giant aneurysms by flow diverting stents. We aim to stimulate a discussion of the best management paradigm for this challenging aneurysm subtype. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively identified 6 patients with fusiform vertebrobasilar giant aneurysms who had been treated with flow-diverting stents between October 2009 and March 2012 in our center. The available data were re-evaluated. The modified Rankin Scale score was assessed before intervention, during the stay in hospital, and at discharge. RESULTS Six patients were identified (all male; age range, 49-71 years; median age, 60 years). Handling of material was successful in all cases. No primary periprocedural complications occurred. The mean follow-up was 13 months (15 days to 29 months). During follow-up, 3 of 6 patients had recurrent cerebral infarctions, but no patient experienced SAH. Two patients presented with acute thrombotic stent occlusion. The modified Rankin Scale score was not higher than 3 in any of the cases before intervention, whereas the best mRS score at the last follow-up was 5. Four of 6 patients died during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Endovascular treatment of fusiform vertebrobasilar giant aneurysms with flow-diverting devices is feasible from a technical point of view; however, changes in hemodynamics with secondary thrombosis are not predictable. We currently do not intend to treat fusiform vertebrobasilar giant aneurysms with flow-diverting devices until we have further understanding of the pathophysiology, natural history, and hemodynamic effects of flow diversion.",23chkz48

Intra-aneurysmal flow reduction induces progressive aneurysm thrombosis in most patients. Understanding the degree of flow modification necessary to induce complete aneurysm occlusion among patients with considerable hemodynamics variability may be important for treatment planning. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients with incidental intracranial saccular aneurysms who underwent FDS endovascular procedures were included and studied for a 12 months' follow-up period. We used computational fluid dynamics on patient-specific geometries from 3D rotational angiography without and with virtual stent placement and thus compared intra-aneurysmal hemodynamic problems. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to estimate the stent:no-stent minimum hemodynamic ratio thresholds that significantly (p≤0.05) determined the condition necessary for long-term (12 months) aneurysm occlusion. RESULTS We included 12 consecutive patients with sidewall aneurysms located in the internal carotid or vertebral artery. The measured porosity of the 12 deployed virtual FDSs was 83±3% (mean±SD). Nine aneurysms were occluded during the 12 months' follow-up, whereas three were not. A significant (p=0.05) area under the curve (AUC) was found for spatiotemporal mean velocity reduction in the aneurysms: AUC=0.889±0.113 (mean±SD) corresponding to a minimum velocity reduction threshold of 0.353 for occlusion to occur. The 95% CI of the AUC was 0.66 to 1.00. The sensitivity and specificity of the method were ∼99% and ∼67%, respectively. For both wall shear stress and pressure reductions in aneurysms no thresholds could be determined: AUC=0.63±0.16 (p=0.518) and 0.67±0.165 (p=0.405), respectively. CONCLUSIONS For successful FDS treatment the post-stent average velocity in sidewall intracranial aneurysms must be reduced by at least one-third from the initial pre-stent conditions.",wr33wczw

This flow-diversion device is being used in Europe for intracranial aneurysm treatment by aneurysm occlusion. The device construct creates an intracranial bypass conduit that reconstructs the parent vessel while maintaining patency of the perforating arteries and branch arteries. The investigators report the first two patients in which the SILK stent was used for intracranial aneurysms in the United States. CASE DESCRIPTION Two patients, one with a symptomatic giant posterior communicating artery aneurysm and one with a symptomatic fusiform vertebrobasilar junction and basilar artery aneurysm, were treated at two separate institutions with the device. A total of three SILK stents were placed in these patients. In the first patient, a single device was sufficient to cause immediate angiographic stasis within the posterior communicating artery aneurysm. However, reversal of anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy was required due to a spontaneous bleed from an intercostal artery, and this led to in-stent thrombosis and major stroke. In the second patient, the placement of two devices resulted in immediate stasis of the basilar artery aneurysm. The patient remained on antiplatelet therapy and was discharged without complication. His follow-up angiogram at approximately 2 months showed complete occlusion of the aneurysm with parent vessel reconstruction. In both patients, immediate stasis was identified, and no immediate neurological complications occurred. However, in one patient, a complication occurred that was related to reversal of/cessation of antiplatelet therapy.

We therefore evaluated PED cases complicated by acute thrombus formation at our institution, with an emphasis on identifying early angiographic signs that may portend this event. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively identified cases of acute thrombosis following PED placement in 100 consecutive procedures performed at our institution from a prospectively maintained clinical database. Angiographic findings were analyzed for early signs of acute thrombus formation. We also evaluated the efficacy of treatment of this complication with a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor (abciximab), as well as the results of pre-procedure platelet inhibition testing. RESULTS Acute thrombus formation was encountered in five patients following PED placement (5%). Early angiographic signs were present in all cases and included progressive stagnation of blood flow in covered side branches, occlusion of covered side branches, excessive stagnation of blood flow in the target aneurysm, as well as occlusion of the target aneurysm. These sequelae completely resolved following abciximab treatment in all five cases, with no permanent neurological morbidity or mortality. Four of the five patients had a pre-procedure P2Y12 value >200 (range 201-227). CONCLUSIONS Progressive stagnation or occlusion of covered side branches or target aneurysm are early angiographic signs of acute thrombus formation following PED placement and should prompt immediate treatment with a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor. Platelet inhibition testing may help identify those patients who are at an increased risk for this complication.",s9n8ukmk

The CLOTS 3 trial aims to determine whether, compared with best medical care, best medical care plus intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) in immobile stroke patients reduces the risk of proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT). METHODS/DESIGN The CLOTS 3 trial is a multicenter, parallel group trial with centralized randomization (minimization) to ensure allocation concealment. The protocol has been published (Trials 2012, 13:26) and is available in full at: http://www.clotstrial.com. Between December 2008 and September 2012, 105 centers in the UK recruited 2,876 immobile stroke patients within the first 3 days of their hospital admission. Patients were allocated to best medical care or best medical care plus IPC. Ultrasonographers performed a compression Doppler ultrasound scan to detect DVT in each treatment group at 7 to 10 days and 25 to 30 days. The primary outcome cluster includes symptomatic or asymptomatic DVT in the popliteal or femoral veins detected on either scan. Patients will be followed up by postal or telephone questionnaire at 6 months from randomization to detect later symptomatic DVT and pulmonary embolism (PE), and to measure functional outcome (Oxford Handicap Scale) and quality of life (EQ-5D-3L). The ultrasonographers performing the scans are blinded to treatment allocation, whereas the patients and caregivers are not. The trial has more than 90% power to detect a 4% absolute difference (12% versus 8%) in risk of the primary outcome and includes a health economic analysis.Follow-up will be completed in April 2013 and the results reported in May 2013.

METHODS AND RESULTS Five randomized controlled trials encompassing 10,350 patients were included. Primary efficacy and safety endpoints were all-cause death and major bleeding, respectively. All-cause death at 30 days did not significantly differ with bivalirudin compared to heparin (odds ratio (OR) 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74-1.28; P=0.84). Major bleeding was significantly reduced by bivalirudin compared to heparin (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.40-0.85; P=0.005). Bivalirudin use was associated with non-significantly different rates of 30-day definite stent thrombosis (ST) (OR 1.71, 95% CI 0.84-3.49; P=0.14), albeit with higher rates of acute ST (OR 3.55, 95% CI 1.67-7.56; P=0.001) and non-significantly different rates of subacute ST (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.46-1.61; P=0.64). There were non-significant differences in the 30-day rates of reinfarction (OR 1.47, 95% CI 0.94-2.30; P=0.10) and cardiovascular death (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.56-1.02; P=0.07). There were no significant interactions between bailout versus routine GPI use in the heparin arm for any of the safety or efficacy outcomes (all Pinteraction>0.10). CONCLUSIONS Bivalirudin compared with heparin was associated with comparable 30-day rates of mortality with reduced major bleeding, at the price of an increased risk of acute ST, with non-significant differences in the overall 30-day rates of ST and reinfarction. Intended use of GPI in the heparin arm did not significantly modify the treatment effects of bivalirudin. Given the important differences between trials, as well as evolution in technique and adjunct pharmacotherapy, further randomized trials are warranted to discriminate whether there are substantial safety and efficacy differences between these agents during primary PCI in STEMI.",m7hihuda

In patients with MMA and moderate-to-severe renal impairment, combined liver–kidney transplantation is indicated. However, clinical experience of these transplantation options in patients with PA and MMA remains limited and fragmented. We undertook an overview of post-transplantation outcomes in patients with PA and MMA using the current available evidence. METHODS: A literature search identified publications on the use of transplantation in patients with PA and MMA. Publications were considered if they presented adequate demographic and outcome data from patients with PA or MMA. Publications that did not report any specific outcomes for patients or provided insufficient data were excluded. RESULTS: Seventy publications were identified of which 38 were full papers. A total of 373 patients underwent liver/kidney/combined liver–kidney transplantation for PA or MMA. The most typical reason for transplantation was recurrent metabolic decompensation. A total of 27 post-transplant deaths were reported in patients with PA [14.0% (27/194)]. For patients with MMA, 18 post-transplant deaths were reported [11% (18/167)]. A total of 62 complications were reported in 115 patients with PA (54%) with cardiomyopathy (n = 12), hepatic arterial thrombosis (HAT; n = 14) and viral infections (n = 12) being the most commonly reported. A total of 52 complications were reported in 106 patients with MMA (49%) with viral infections (n = 14) and renal failure/impairment (n = 10) being the most commonly reported. CONCLUSIONS: Liver transplantation and combined liver–kidney transplantation appears to benefit some patients with PA or MMA, respectively, but this approach does not provide complete correction of the metabolic defect and some patients remain at risk from disease-related and transplantation-related complications, including death. Thus, all treatment avenues should be exhausted before consideration of organ transplantation and the benefits of this approach must be weighed against the risk of perioperative complications on an individual basis.",7ed958ve

Imaging and pathologic analysis have defined CaW as an intimal variant of fibromuscular dysplasia, which appears as a shelflike lesion on the posterior aspect of the carotid bulb, more specifically at the origin of internal carotid artery. Reported findings of carotid webs in young patients with recurrent ischemic strokes without an otherwise determined cause have raised questions about the mechanism, natural history, and need for intervention. This review addresses the current understanding of CaW and highlights findings that prompt further investigation into this unique vascular entity as a modifiable stroke risk factor. Observations Imaging analysis demonstrates hemodynamic disturbance in the presence of CaWs. The protuberant shelflike structure creates a pocket therein that may subsequently lead to local thrombosis and cerebral embolism. Computed tomographic angiography is an accurate and often used noninvasive diagnostic modality. Although treatment paradigms have not been systematically evaluated, antiplatelet monotherapy may not be sufficient to reduce recurrent ischemic events in the small series of patients with stroke and symptomatic CaWs. Conclusions and Relevance The limited clinical data on CaWs, although complicated by selection bias, suggest an increased prevalence of these vascular entities in cerebral ischemic events among patients younger than 60 years. Imaging suggests CaW to be a possible nidus for cerebral thromboembolism. Physicians should consider CaW as a cause of stroke in younger patients with anterior circulation ischemic strokes of an otherwise undetermined cause. Treatment options in CaWs with ischemic strokes have not been extensively investigated. Multicenter observational studies evaluating the natural history of CaW are warranted.",gw8jx47f

These lesions, typically classified as aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms, are being detected more frequently with increased utilization of imaging and have various causes (eg, atherosclerosis, trauma, infection) and complications that may be identified radiologically. Ultrasonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging often enable detection of visceral vascular lesions, but angiography is important for further diagnosis and treatment. Endovascular treatment is often the first-line therapy. Endovascular intervention or open surgical repair is necessary for all visceral pseudoaneurysms and is likely indicated for visceral aneurysms 2 cm or more in diameter. Endovascular exclusion of flow can be achieved with coils, stents, and injectable liquids. Techniques include embolization (""sandwich"" or ""sac-packing"" technique), exclusion of flow with luminal stents, and stent-assisted coil embolization. Management often depends on the location and technical feasibility of endovascular repair. Embolization is usually preferred for aneurysms or pseudoaneurysms within solid organs, and the sandwich technique is often used when collateral flow is present. Covered stent placement may be preferred to preserve the parent artery when main visceral vessels are being treated. It is usually tailored to lesion location, and a cure can often be effected while preserving end-organ arterial flow. Posttreatment follow-up is usually based on treatment location, modality accuracy, and potential consequences of treatment failure. Follow-up imaging may help identify vessel recanalization, unintended thrombosis of an artery or end organ, or sequelae of nontarget embolization. Retreatment is usually warranted if the clinical risks for which embolization was performed are still present.",0ph2iy6g

Objective To understand why the burden is so high, qualitative and quantitative research was carried out to gain insights from experts, guidelines and published studies on the unmet clinical needs and therapeutic strategies in VTE prevention and treatment in three populations identified as being at increased risk of VTE and in whom VTE prevention and treatment were regarded as suboptimal: pregnant women, the elderly and obese patients. Methodology A gap analysis methodology was created to highlight unmet needs in VTE management and to discover the patient populations considered most at risk. A questionnaire was devised to guide qualitative interviews with 44 thrombosis and haemostasis experts, and a review of the literature on VTE in the specific patient groups from 2015 to 2017 was completed. This was followed by a Think Tank meeting where the results from the research were discussed. Results This review highlights the insights gained and examines in detail the unmet needs with regard to VTE risk-assessment tools, biomarkers, patient stratification methods, and anticoagulant and dosing regimens in pregnant women, the elderly and obese patients. Conclusions Specifically, in pregnant women at high risk of VTE, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is the therapy of choice, but it remains unclear how to use anticoagulants when VTE risk is intermediate. In elderly patients, evaluation of the benefit of VTE prophylaxis against the bleeding risk is particularly important, and a head-to-head comparison of efficacy and safety of LMWH versus direct oral anticoagulants is needed. Finally, in obese patients, lack of guidance on anticoagulant dose adjustment to body weight has emerged as a major obstacle in effective prophylaxis and treatment of VTE.",ohk3o23s

We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of flow diverting stents (FDS) in the treatment of these aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed our prospectively maintained database to collect information for all patients with unruptured saccular bifurcation MCA aneurysms treated with FDS between January 2010 and January 2016. In addition to demographic data, we recorded the location, aneurysm characteristics, previous treatments, number and type of FDS, complications, and clinical and angiographic follow-up. RESULTS Our search identified 13 patients (7 males) with an average age of 61.7 years (47-74 years). All patients had a single bifurcation aneurysm of the MCA, and none of the aneurysms were acutely ruptured. The average fundus size of the saccular aneurysms was 3 mm (range 1.5-10 mm). Follow-up studies were available for 12 patients. Based on the most recent follow-up angiograms, six aneurysms (50%) were totally occluded; five aneurysms (41.7%) showed only a small remnant; and one aneurysm (8.3%) remained unchanged. One patient suffered from an ischemic stroke with resultant permanent hemiparesis (mRS 3). In another case, there was an in-stent thrombosis during the intervention, which resolved upon intra-arterial infusion of Eptifibatide (mRS 0). There were no intra-operative vessel or aneurysm ruptures and no mortalities. Angiography of the covered MCA branches showed no change in the caliber or flow of the vessel in six (50%), a reduction in caliber in five (41.7%), and a complete occlusion in one (8.3%). All caliber changes and occlusions of the vessels were asymptomatic. CONCLUSION In our series, 91.7% of treated MCA bifurcation aneurysms were either completely occluded or showed only a small remnant with a good safety profile.

Whether the benefits of new-generation DES are preserved in women undergoing complex percutaneous revascularization is unknown. METHODS We pooled patient-level data from women enrolled in 26 randomized trials of DES. Study population was categorized according to the presence or absence of CPCI, which was defined as the composite of total stent length >30 mm, ≥2 stents implanted, ≥2 lesions treated, or bifurcation lesion as target vessel. The primary endpoint was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) defined as a composite of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, or target lesion revascularization at 3 years of follow-up. RESULTS Of 10,241 women included in the pooled database, 4,629 (45%) underwent CPCI. Compared with non-CPCI, women who underwent CPCI had a higher 3-year risk of MACE (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 1.63; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.45 to 1.83; p < 0.0001). In women who underwent CPCI, use of new-generation DES was associated with significantly lower 3-year risk of MACE (adjusted HR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.68 to 0.96), target lesion revascularization (adjusted HR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.57 to 0.95), and definite or probable stent thrombosis (ST) (adjusted HR: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.30 to 0.83). The benefit of new-generation DES on efficacy and safety outcomes was uniform between CPCI and non-CPCI groups, without evidence of interaction. By landmark analysis, new-generation DES were associated with low rates (≤0.4%) of very-late ST irrespective of procedural complexity. CONCLUSIONS Women undergoing CPCI remain at higher risk of adverse events. The long-term ischemic benefits of new-generation DES platforms are uniform among complex and non-complex percutaneous revascularization procedures in women.",cwbx6c50

Data on the safety and efficacy of this treatment for posterior circulation aneurysms are limited. OBJECTIVE To present our posterior circulation flow diverter experience, outcomes and morbidity in comparison with recent studies. METHODS A retrospective chart and imaging review of six patients with seven aneurysms in posterior circulation vessels, treated with flow diverter technology was carried out. A literature review was performed using standard online search tools. RESULTS We included five saccular and two fusiform posterior circulation aneurysms. An average of two flow diverters was placed for each patient. Adjunctive coiling was used in three cases. Follow-up at an average of 14.5 months showed complete angiographic occlusion in 4 (57.1%) cases, including one patient with in-stent thrombosis and major brainstem stroke at 4.5 months, a week after self-discontinuing dual antiplatelet therapy. Two other patients developed small periprocedural strokes but had excellent recovery. One death occurred 18 months after the initial procedure. No aneurysm rupture or parenchymal hemorrhage was seen. Overall, 5 (71%) cases, all with saccular aneurysms, had good clinical outcome (modified Rankin score (mRS) 0-1). Fusiform basilar aneurysms had markedly worse outcomes (mRS 5 and 6). Our literature review yielded six other studies with 100 additional patients. Overall, good outcome was seen in 74.3%, with a 12.3% average mortality and 11% permanent neurologic deficit rate. Complete occlusion varied from 43% to 100%. CONCLUSIONS Flow diversion may be a possible treatment in carefully selected patients with high-risk atypical posterior circulation aneurysms, with poor natural history and no optimal treatment strategy. Symptomatic and fusiform large aneurysms appear to carry the highest risk. Further studies are necessary to assess the role of flow diversion in the posterior circulation.",5th59pg7

METHODS A post hoc analysis of the erythropoietin in traumatic brain injury (EPO-TBI) trial that included twice-weekly lower limb ultrasound screening. Venous thrombotic events were defined as ultrasound-proven proximal deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or clinically detected pulmonary embolism (PE). Results are reported as events, percentages or medians and interquartile range (IQR). Cox regression analysis was used to calculate adjusted hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for time to VTE and death. RESULTS Of 603 patients, 119 (19.7%) developed VTE, mostly comprising DVT (102 patients, 16.9%) with a smaller number of PE events (24 patients, 4.0%). Median time to DVT diagnosis was 6 days (IQR 2-11) and to PE diagnosis 6.5 days (IQR 2-16.5). Mechanical prophylaxis (MP) was used in 91% of patients on day 1, 97% of patients on day 3 and 98% of patients on day 7. Pharmacological prophylaxis was given in 5% of patients on day 1, 30% of patients on day 3 and 57% of patients on day 7. Factors associated with time to VTE were age (HR per year 1.02, 95% CI 1.01-1.03), patient weight (HR per kg 1.01, 95% CI 1-1.02) and TBI severity according to the International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials risk of poor outcome (HR per 10% increase 1.12, 95% CI 1.01-1.25). The development of VTE was not associated with mortality (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.51-1.65). CONCLUSIONS Despite mechanical and pharmacological prophylaxis, VTE occurs in one out of every five patients with TBI treated in the ICU. Higher age, greater weight and greater severity of TBI increase the risk. The development of VTE was not associated with excess mortality.",n49mozpm

A technician who was blinded to treatment allocation undertook compression Doppler ultrasound of both legs at about 7-10 days and, when practical, again at 25-30 days after enrolment. The primary outcome was the occurrence of symptomatic or asymptomatic DVT in the popliteal or femoral veins. Analyses were by intention to treat. This study is registered, number ISRCTN28163533. FINDINGS All patients were included in the analyses. The primary outcome occurred in 126 (10.0%) patients allocated to thigh-length GCS and in 133 (10.5%) allocated to avoid GCS, resulting in a non-significant absolute reduction in risk of 0.5% (95% CI -1.9% to 2.9%). Skin breaks, ulcers, blisters, and skin necrosis were significantly more common in patients allocated to GCS than in those allocated to avoid their use (64 [5%] vs 16 [1%]; odds ratio 4.18, 95% CI 2.40-7.27). INTERPRETATION These data do not lend support to the use of thigh-length GCS in patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke. National guidelines for stroke might need to be revised on the basis of these results.

METHODS We performed a prospective, multicenter, observational study of 30-day outcomes in consecutive patients undergoing bariatric surgical procedures at 10 clinical sites in the United States from 2005 through 2007. A composite end point of 30-day major adverse outcomes (including death; venous thromboembolism; percutaneous, endoscopic, or operative reintervention; and failure to be discharged from the hospital) was evaluated among patients undergoing first-time bariatric surgery. RESULTS There were 4776 patients who had a first-time bariatric procedure (mean age, 44.5 years; 21.1% men; 10.9% nonwhite; median body-mass index [the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters], 46.5). More than half had at least two coexisting conditions. A Roux-en-Y gastric bypass was performed in 3412 patients (with 87.2% of the procedures performed laparoscopically), and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding was performed in 1198 patients; 166 patients underwent other procedures and were not included in the analysis. The 30-day rate of death among patients who underwent a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding was 0.3%; a total of 4.3% of patients had at least one major adverse outcome. A history of deep-vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolus, a diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea, and impaired functional status were each independently associated with an increased risk of the composite end point. Extreme values of body-mass index were significantly associated with an increased risk of the composite end point, whereas age, sex, race, ethnic group, and other coexisting conditions were not. CONCLUSIONS The overall risk of death and other adverse outcomes after bariatric surgery was low and varied considerably according to patient characteristics. In helping patients make appropriate choices, short-term safety should be considered in conjunction with both the long-term effects of bariatric surgery and the risks associated with being extremely obese.

METHODS We evaluated patients from the all-comer PARIS registry treated with dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and clopidogrel following coronary stenting for outcomes stratified by PPI use. Two-year major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, definite or probable stent thrombosis or target lesion revascularization (TLR), and net adverse cardiac events (NACE), composite of MACE or Bleeding Academic Research consortium (BARC) type 3 or 5 bleeding were assessed. We also explored associations between PPI use and patterns of 2-year DAPT cessation. RESULTS The cohort comprised 4635 patients (23% PPI users) with mean age 64.4 ±11.4 years. Two year adjusted risk of MACE (HR: 1.27, 95% CI: 1.04-1.55), NACE (HR: 1.21, 95% CI: 1.01-1.44) and TLR (HR: 1.33, 95% CI: 1.04-1.71) were significantly higher in PPI users vs. non-users, without a difference in bleeding. Although the incidence of 2-year DAPT discontinuation and interruption was similar, DAPT disruption was significantly lower among PPI users vs. non-users (10.0% vs. 14.7%, P <0.0001). Compared to non-PPI users on continued DAPT, disruption was associated with higher MACE in both PPI users (HR: 2.34, 95% CI: 1.38-3.97) and non-users (HR: 1.41, 95% CI: 1.02-1.94) but greater BARC 3,5 bleeding only in non-PPI users (HR: 2.06, 95% CI: 1.21-3.51). CONCLUSIONS In clopidogrel treated PCI patients, the 2-year adjusted risk of MACE and NACE was significantly higher in PPI users driven by higher TLR compared to non-PPI users, without a difference in bleeding. PPI use was associated with lower incidence of DAPT disruption without an increase in disruption related bleeding compared to non-PPI users on DAPT. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",ma870o8v

Historically, this has been treated with an open surgical approach (with high morbidity) and with angioplasty in more recent years. Herein we describe technical aspects of stenting of the IVC in patients with recalcitrant chronic occlusive disease and evaluate its outcomes. METHODS We reviewed all the patients treated in an endovascular fashion for venous disease at our institution from 2005 to 2014 to identify and to include those with IVC stent placement in this study. Clinical characteristics, treatment details, and outcomes data were collected from medical records. Primary end points were technical success, symptom resolution, freedom from reintervention, and patency rate at follow-up. RESULTS Twenty-eight patients (15 men) with a mean age of 48 ± 2.7 years underwent IVC stent placement for 16 occlusions (4 congenital) and 12 high-grade stenoses. Hypercoagulable state was noted in 14 patients, 7 of whom had malignant disease. A previously placed IVC filter was present in 13 patients. Median time from onset of symptoms to presentation was 81 months (3-480 months). Lytic therapy with tissue plasminogen activator (Alteplase) was performed in 12 patients for a median of 2 days (range, 1-3 days). Self-expanding stents (Wallstent; Boston Scientific, Natick, Mass) were used most commonly in the IVC (n = 22) with or without adjunctive use of balloon-expandable stents (Palmaz stent; Cordis, New Brunswick, NJ). Technical success was 100%. At median follow-up of 10 months (range, 0-56 months), thrombotic complications requiring reintervention occurred in four patients at 1, 4, 8, and 37 months. One patient died at 2 weeks secondary to underlying malignant disease. Freedom from reintervention, patency rate, and symptom-free survival rate at 2 years were 84%, 90%, and 80%. CONCLUSIONS Endovascular stenting for chronic occlusive disease of the IVC is safe and effective in the midterm follow-up, with minimal morbidity. Reintervention rate is low, with excellent functional outcomes.",ydt8uefz

Studies have shown that thrombus resolution with catheter-directed thrombolysis in patients with iliofemoral DVT reduces postthrombotic morbidity, although patients unsuccessfully treated with catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) do not enjoy the same long-term benefit. The purpose of this study is to objectively assess whether the amount of clot reduction at the time of acute therapy correlates with long-term postthrombotic morbidity. METHODS Forty-two patients who underwent catheter-directed and/or pharmacomechanical lysis of iliofemoral DVT were quantitatively evaluated. Patients had their degree of clot lysis quantified and were divided into two main groups for comparison. Group I (n = 33) had >50% clot lysis (mean, 84%) and group II (n = 9) had < or =50% lysis (mean, 42%). At a mean follow-up interval of 14 months, the degree of chronic venous disease was assessed by evaluators blinded to the degree of clot lysis. Evaluation of postthrombotic morbidity was performed using the Villalta scale, and the clinical class of CEAP, and quality-of-life (QOL) was assessed using the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). RESULTS Mean CEAP scores were 0.85 and 3.13 (P = .005), and Villalta scores were 2.38 and 6.25 (P = .009) in group I and group II, respectively. Patient QOL in group I was higher than group II in all parameters. Physical functioning (P = .035), role physical (P = .012), general health (P = .014), vitality (P < .001), and social functioning (P = .012) were all significantly better in group I. Bodily pain (P = .117), role emotional (P = .624), and mental health (P = .096) strongly favored group I patients but did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION Patients with extensive DVT treated with catheter-based interventions to eliminate thrombus suffer relatively little postthrombotic morbidity. The degree of clot lysis directly correlates with long-term outcome. Improved QOL, the Villalta scale, and clinical class of CEAP are linearly correlated with the amount of clot resolution.",cm0mvbd5

METHODS Endovenous ablation was performed on symptomatic patients with incompetent SSVs following a minimum of 3 months of compression therapy. Demographic data, risk factors, CEAP classification, procedure details, and follow-up data were recorded. A four-tier classification system and treatment algorithm was developed, based on EHIT proximity to the popliteal vein. RESULTS Eighty limbs (in 76 patients) were treated with RFA of the SSV between January 2008 and August 2012. Duplex ultrasound was performed between 24 and 72 hours postprocedure in all patients. Ablation was successful in 98.7% (79/80) of procedures. Sixty-eight (85%) patients had level A closures (≥ 1 mm caudal to popliteal vein) and 10 patients (13%) had level B closures (flush with popliteal vein) and were observed. Two limbs (3%) had EHIT extending into the popliteal vein (level C) and were treated with outpatient low-molecular-weight heparin anticoagulation. Thrombus retracted to the level of the saphenopopliteal junction in both patients following a short course of anticoagulation. No patient developed an occlusive deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (level D). Mean follow-up period was 6.2 months; no patient had small saphenous recanalization, occlusive DVT, or pulmonary embolus. The presence or absence of the Giacomini vein was not predictive of level B and C closure. CONCLUSIONS RFA of the SSV in symptomatic patients has a high success rate with a low risk of DVT. A classification system and treatment protocol based on the level of EHIT in relation to the saphenopopliteal junction is useful in managing patients. The approach to patients with thrombus flush with the popliteal vein or bulging has not been previously defined; our outcomes were excellent, using our treatment algorithm.",nfoahzo2

OBJECTIVE To review the contemporary literature on optimal medical therapy after PCI. EVIDENCE REVIEW We performed a comprehensive search of the PubMed and Cochrane Library databases for manuscripts on medical therapy after PCI, published between 2000 and February 2013. Bibliographies of the retrieved studies were searched by hand for other relevant studies. Priority was given to data from large randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses. Of the 6852 publications retrieved, 91 were included. FINDINGS Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor (eg, ticlopidine, clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor) reduces the risk of stent thrombosis and subsequent cardiovascular events post-PCI (number needed to treat, 33-53) and is the current standard of care. Aspirin should be continued indefinitely and low dose (75-100 mg daily) is preferred over higher doses. A P2Y12 inhibitor should be administered for 12 months after PCI, unless the patient is at high risk for bleeding; however, ongoing studies are assessing the value of shorter or longer duration of P2Y12 inhibitor administration. In patients with acute coronary syndromes, prasugrel and ticagrelor further reduce cardiovascular ischemic events compared with clopidogrel but are associated with higher bleeding risk. If possible, noncardiac surgery should be delayed until 12 months after coronary stenting. Patients receiving coronary stents who require warfarin are at high risk for bleeding if they also receive dual antiplatelet therapy. Omission of aspirin may be advantageous in such patients. Routine platelet function or genetic testing is currently not recommended to tailor antiplatelet therapy after PCI. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Dual antiplatelet therapy remains the cornerstone of medical therapy after PCI. Continuous advances in pharmacotherapy can further enhance our capacity to improve outcomes in this high-risk patient group.",6m3r024t

OBJECTIVES The primary objective was to compare in-hospital outcomes of CDT plus anticoagulation with those of anticoagulation alone. The secondary objective was to evaluate the temporal trends in the utilization and outcomes of CDT in the treatment of proximal DVT. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Observational study of patients with a principal discharge diagnosis of proximal or caval DVT from 2005 to 2010 in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database. We compared patients treated with CDT plus anticoagulation with the patients treated with anticoagulation alone. We used propensity scores to construct 2 matched groups of 3594 patients in each group for comparative outcomes analysis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary study outcome was in-hospital mortality. The secondary outcomes included bleeding complications, length of stay, and hospital charges. RESULTS Among a total of 90,618 patients hospitalized for DVT (national estimate of 449,200 hospitalizations), 3649 (4.1%) underwent CDT. The CDT utilization rates increased from 2.3% in 2005 to 5.9% in 2010. Based on the propensity-matched comparison, the in-hospital mortality was not significantly different between the CDT and the anticoagulation groups (1.2% vs 0.9%) (OR, 1.40 [95% CI, 0.88-2.25]) (P = .15). The rates of blood transfusion (11.1% vs 6.5%) (OR, 1.85 [95% CI, 1.57-2.20]) (P < .001), pulmonary embolism (17.9% vs 11.4%) (OR, 1.69 [95% CI, 1.49-1.94]) (P < .001), intracranial hemorrhage (0.9% vs 0.3%) (OR, 2.72 [95% CI, 1.40-5.30]) (P = .03), and vena cava filter placement (34.8% vs 15.6%) (OR, 2.89 [95% CI, 2.58-3.23]) (P < .001) were significantly higher in the CDT group. The CDT group had longer mean (SD) length of stay (7.2 [5.8] vs 5.0 [4.7] days) (OR, 2.27 [95% CI, 1.49-1.94]) (P < .001) and higher hospital charges ($85,094 [$69,121] vs $28,164 [$42,067]) (P < .001) compared with the anticoagulation group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study, we did not find any difference in the mortality between the CDT and the anticoagulation groups, but evidence of higher adverse events was noted in the CDT group. In the context of this observational data and continued improvements in technology, a randomized trial with outcomes such as mortality and postthrombotic syndrome is needed to definitively address this comparative effectiveness.",igqdzmsx

Venous angioplasty and stent placement has been progressively used to restore and maintain venous patency in PTS patients. This study reports our single-center experience with the use of endovascular treatment for chronic post-thrombotic symptomatic ilio-femoral venous obstructive lesions. METHODS A prospective mono-centric observational cohort study of PTS patients with chronic symptomatic ilio-femoral venous obstructive lesions referred for endovascular treatment was conducted from March 2012 to April 2016. Procedure consisted in recanalization, pre-dilation and self-expandable stenting of stenotic or occluded iliac and/or femoral veins. Severity of PTS, quality-of-life and treatment outcomes were assessed using Villalta scale and Chronic Venous Insufficiency Questionnaire (CIVIQ-20) at baseline and 3 months after the procedure. Imaging follow-up was based on duplex ultrasound (US) and computed tomography (CT). RESULTS Twenty-one patients (11 females, 10 males; median age, 41 years; range, 32-60) were included. Recanalization and stenting was successfully accomplished in all prime procedures, 4 patients benefitted from an additional procedure. Immediate technical success rate was 96% considering 25 procedures, performed without any complications. Median follow-up was 18 months (range, 6-30 months) with a 90.5% stent patency rate. Villalta score significantly decreased from baseline compared with 3 months after the procedure [14 (range, 11-22) and 5 (range, 1-10), respectively, P<0.0001], showing a significant decrease in the severity of PTS. CIVIQ-20 score significantly decreased from baseline compared with 3 months after stenting [48.5 (range, 39-73) and 26.5 (range, 21-45), respectively, P<0.0001] thus showing a significant improvement of quality-of-life. Post-procedural CIVIQ-20 score was significantly associated with Villalta score (95% CI, 1.53-2.95; P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS Our results confirm the high clinical success rate and safety of endovascular PTS treatment and highlight the significant impact of stenting on the quality of life of patients with chronic symptomatic ilio-femoral venous obstructive lesions.",8pbo247t

With the widespread introduction of fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair by the Food and Drug Administration-approved Zenith Fenestrated endograft (ZFEN; Cook Medical, Bloomington, Ind) to the United States in 2012, clinicians gained the ability to apply the chimney technique to these custom devices for difficult anatomy. The purpose of this report was to demonstrate feasibility and to provide evidence on the performance of chimneys for the treatment of complex juxtarenal aneurysms that could not be adequately treated with ZFEN alone. METHODS A retrospective analysis was performed of a prospectively maintained institutional ZFEN database capturing 110 fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repairs from October 2012 to January 2018 to identify patients undergoing a concomitant visceral artery chimney. All patients with <12 months of follow-up were excluded from further analysis. Demographic, anatomic, intraoperative, perioperative, and follow-up characteristics were tabulated and analyzed. RESULTS Six patients met criteria and were included in this investigation. They were universally male with a mean age of 76.2 years at the time of ZFEN/chimney. Chimneys were placed in a total of six visceral arteries (n = 1 per patient) consisting of three renal arteries, two celiac arteries, and one accessory renal artery. Mean estimated blood loss and operative time were 283 mL and 298 minutes, respectively. Technical success was achieved in all cases. Two small type IA ""gutter"" endoleaks were detected early; both spontaneously resolved on follow-up. We observed no instances of chimney migration, stenosis, or thrombosis perioperatively or on follow-up. Two reinterventions were performed in these six patients; these consisted of a repeated renal stent for ostial stenosis at a main body fenestration and a common femoral artery endarterectomy and patch angioplasty for an access-related common femoral artery occlusion. CONCLUSIONS Use of ZFEN in conjunction with a singular chimney is safe, feasible, and durable in patients with difficult anatomy who do not meet instructions for use as demonstrated in this limited series.",a1xqfjny

Thrombosis in placental and spinal vessels and subsequent ischemic injury in EHV-1-infected horses manifests clinically as abortion and myeloencephalopathy. We have previously shown that addition of heparin anticoagulants to equine platelet-rich plasma (PRP) can abolish ex vivo EHV-1-induced platelet activation. The goal of this study was to test whether platelets isolated from horses treated with unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) were resistant to ex vivo EHV-1-induced activation. In a masked, block-randomized placebo-controlled cross-over trial, 9 healthy adult horses received 4 subcutaneous injections at q. 12 h intervals of one of the following treatments: UFH (100 U/kg loading dose, 3 maintenance doses of 80 U/kg), 2 doses of LMWH (enoxaparin) 80 U/kg 24 h apart with saline at the intervening 12 h intervals, or 4 doses of saline. Blood samples were collected before treatment and after 36 h, 40 h (4 h after the last injection) and 60 h (24 h after the last injection). Two strains of EHV-1, Ab4 and RacL11, were added to PRP ex vivo and platelet membrane expression of P selectin was measured as a marker of platelet activation. Drug concentrations were monitored in a Factor Xa inhibition (anti-Xa) bioassay. We found that LMWH, but not UFH, inhibited platelet activation induced by low concentrations (1 × 106 plaque forming units/mL) of both EHV-1 strains at 40 h. At this time point, all horses had anti-Xa activities above 0.1 U/ml (range 0.15-0.48 U/ml) with LMWH, but not UFH. By 60 h, a platelet inhibitory effect was no longer detected and anti-Xa activity had decreased (range 0.03 to 0.07 U/ml) in LMWH-treated horses. Neither heparin inhibited platelet activation induced by high concentrations (5 × 106 plaque forming units/mL) of the RacL11 strain. We found substantial between horse variability in EHV-1-induced platelet activation at baseline and after treatment. Minor injection site reactions developed in horses given either heparin. These results suggest that LMWH therapy may prevent thrombotic sequelae of EHV-1, however further evaluation of dosage regimens is required.",0jlk1fs0

Although below-knee stockings are used more often than thigh-length stockings, no reliable evidence indicates that they are as effective as thigh-length stockings. OBJECTIVE To compare the effectiveness of thigh-length stockings with that of below-knee stockings for preventing proximal DVT in immobile, hospitalized patients with stroke. DESIGN Parallel-group trial with centralized randomization (minimization within centers) to ensure allocation concealment. The ultrasonographers who looked for DVT were blinded, but the patients and caregivers were not. (Controlled-trials.com registration number: ISRCTN28163533) SETTING 112 hospitals in 9 countries. PATIENTS 3114 immobile patients hospitalized with acute stroke between January 2002 and May 2009. INTERVENTION 1552 patients received thigh-length stockings and 1562 patients received below-knee stockings to wear while they were in the hospital. MEASUREMENTS Ultrasonographers performed compression duplex ultrasonography in 1406 patients (96% of survivors) in each treatment group between 7 and 10 days after enrollment. They performed a second scan in 643 patients in the thigh-length stockings group and 639 in the below-knee stockings group at about 25 to 30 days. The primary outcome was symptomatic or asymptomatic DVT in the popliteal or femoral veins, detected on either scan. RESULTS Patients were retained in their assigned group for all analyses. The primary outcome occurred in 98 patients (6.3%) who received thigh-length stockings and 138 (8.8%) who received below-knee stockings (absolute difference, 2.5 percentage points [95% CI, 0.7 to 4.4 percentage points]; P = 0.008), an odds reduction of 31% (CI, 9% to 47%). Seventy-five percent of patients in both groups wore the stockings for 30 days or until they were discharged, died, or regained mobility. Skin breaks occurred in 61 patients who received thigh-length stockings (3.9%) and 45 (2.9%) who received below-knee stockings. LIMITATION Blinding was incomplete, 2 scans were not obtained for all enrolled patients, and the trial was stopped before the target accrual was reached. CONCLUSION Proximal DVT occurs more often in patients with stroke who wear below-knee stockings than in those who wear thigh-length stockings.

METHODS Between 2004 and 2009, 33 patients (18 women; mean age 47 years) with iliofemoral DVT underwent pharmacomechanical thrombectomy using the AngioJet (n = 18) or Trellis (n = 15) devices with 10 mg of tenecteplase. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and venography were performed over the iliofemoral segments before and after treatment. Cross-sectional vessel and lumen diameters were measured from the IVUS scans and the post-procedure anteroposterior and lateral venograms at 3 points (proximal, mid-section, and distal) along each iliofemoral vein by 2 independent observers blinded to the treatment method. Volumes of the recanalized segments were calculated and compared to volumes of the original venous segments to assess clot lysis with each PMT device. IVUS scans and venograms were also compared for their ability to identify residual lesions or clot in need of treatment. Repeatability between and among observers was analyzed using the Bland and Altman method. RESULTS All procedures were successfully completed; there were only 2 minor bleeding complications. The mean volume of the recanalized segment was 2255+/-66 mm(3) by IVUS, representing 80% lysis of the clot compared to what was perceived as >90% lysis with venography (p<0.05). IVUS was able to delineate significant residual thrombus, stenosis, or May-Thurner anatomy requiring ancillary interventions in 100% of patients versus 48% (16/33) on the venograms (p<0.01). Quantitative assessments of the diameters of the involved venous segments from the venograms and IVUS were consistent between and among observers. Comparing the similar patient subgroups, AngioJet resulted in greater clot lysis (88%) versus the Trellis device (72%; p<0.01), corresponding to recanalized venous segment volumes of 2486+/-74 and 2025+/-57 mm(3) and total venous segment volumes of 2826+/-84 and 2813+/-79 mm(3), respectively. CONCLUSION IVUS is superior to venography for detection of residual thrombus and underlying venous pathology after pharmacomechanical thrombectomy. While greater clot lysis was seen with the AngioJet system, both the AngioJet and Trellis devices resulted in excellent clinical clot lysis.",ls0xgg4x

Venous and lymphatic disorders,Assessment of thrombotic adverse events and treatment patterns associated with varicose vein treatment.,"OBJECTIVE This retrospective study assessed varicose vein treatment patterns and associated thrombotic complications in a real-world setting. METHODS A retrospective study was conducted with health care claims data from Truven Health, covering more than 40 million insured lives per year and representing all U.S. census regions. The study sample included subjects aged ≥ 18 years with a new diagnosis of varicose veins who had received at least one invasive treatment (eg, surgery, endovenous thermal ablation [radiofrequency or laser], or sclerotherapy [liquid or foam]). The adverse events of interest included a coded diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism within 30 days of a claim for invasive treatment. Patients treated between January 1, 2008, and June 30, 2012, were observed for up to 2 years after diagnosis. RESULTS There were 985,632 unique subjects diagnosed with varicose veins; of them, a total of 131,887 subjects met all of the study criteria: 63,033 (47.8%) having multiple therapies; 22,980 (17.4%) having laser ablation; 21,637 (16.4%) having radiofrequency ablation; 12,708 (9.6%) having sclerotherapy; and 11,529 (8.7%) having surgery. The mean age of the sample was 52.8 years, ranging from 51.5 years (surgery cohort) to 54.5 years (radiofrequency ablation cohort); 77% of the sample was female, ranging from 71% (radiofrequency ablation cohort) to 92% (sclerotherapy cohort). The mean time to treatment after diagnosis was 105 days, ranging from 75 days (sclerotherapy cohort) to 116 days (radiofrequency ablation cohort). The diagnosed prevalence (percentage of subjects within each treatment cohort) of DVT was as follows: radiofrequency ablation, 4.4%; multiple therapies--same day, 3.4%; laser ablation, 3.1%; multiple therapies--deferred, 2.6%; surgery, 2.4%; and sclerotherapy, 0.8%. For pulmonary embolism, the diagnosed prevalence was as follows: radiofrequency ablation, surgery, and laser ablation, 0.3% each; and multiple therapies--same day, multiple therapies--deferred, and sclerotherapy, 0.2% each. CONCLUSIONS Thrombotic complications associated with invasive varicose vein treatments in the real-world setting may be higher than what has been reported in clinical trials, particularly in regard to DVT after endovenous thermal ablation therapy. A better understanding of these patterns of adverse events may have an impact on new strategies to safely and effectively manage patients with varicose veins.",5vsae1he

Previously, the DCB showed favorable 1-year outcomes compared with conventional percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), yet durability of the treatment effect with DCBs remains unknown. OBJECTIVES This study sought to investigate the longer-term outcomes of a paclitaxel-eluting DCB compared to PTA for femoropopliteal lesions. METHODS We enrolled 331 patients with symptomatic (Rutherford 2 to 4) femoropopliteal lesions up to 18 cm in length. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to treatment with DCB or PTA. The 24-month assessments included primary patency, freedom from clinically driven target lesion revascularization (CD-TLR), major adverse events, and quality of life and functional outcomes as assessed by the EuroQOL-5D quality-of-life questionnaire, walking impairment questionnaire, and 6-min walk test. RESULTS At 24 months, patients treated with DCB showed significantly higher primary patency when compared with PTA (78.9% vs. 50.1%; p < 0.001). The rates of CD-TLR were 9.1% and 28.3% (p < 0.001) for the DCB and PTA groups, respectively. The overall mortality rate in the DCB group was 8.1% versus 0.9% in the PTA group (p = 0.008). There were no device- or procedure-related deaths and no major amputations in either group through 24-month follow-up. The rate of vessel thrombosis was low (1.5% DCB vs. 3.8% PTA; p = 0.243), with no new events reported between 1 and 2 years. Both groups showed similar functional improvement at 2 years, although DCB patients achieved this level of function with 58% fewer reinterventions. CONCLUSIONS The 24-month outcomes from the trial demonstrate a durable and superior treatment effect of DCB versus PTA with significantly higher primary patency, lower CD-TLR, and similar functional status improvement with fewer repeat interventions.

Previous studies, using short sessions (<12 h), failed to find any effects on respiratory system compliance. In the present analysis, the effects of prolonged PP sessions (24 h) were retrospectively studied with regard to safety data, oxygenation and respiratory system compliance. METHODS: Retrospective review of 17 consecutive patients who required both VV-ECMO and prone positioning. PP under VV-ECMO was considered when the patient presented at least one unsuccessful ECMO weaning attempt after day 7 or refractory hypoxemia combined or not with persistent high plateau pressure. PP sessions had a duration of 24 h with fixed ECMO and respiratory settings. PP was not performed in patients under vasopressor treatment and in cases of recent open chest cardiac surgery. RESULTS: Despite optimized protective mechanical ventilation and other adjuvant treatment (i.e. PP, inhaled nitric oxide, recruitment maneuvers), 44 patients received VV-ECMO during the study period for refractory acute respiratory distress syndrome. Global survival rate was 66 %. Among the latter, 17 patients underwent PP during VV-ECMO for a total of 27 sessions. After 24 h in prone position, PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio significantly increased from 111 (84–128) to 173 (120–203) mmHg (p < 0.0001) while respiratory system compliance increased from 18 (12–36) to 32 (15–36) ml/cmH(2)O (p < 0.0001). Twenty-four hours after the return to supine position, tidal volume was increased from 3.0 (2.2–4.0) to 3.7 (2.8–5.0) ml/kg (p < 0.005). PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio increased by over 20 % in 14/14 sessions for late sessions (≥7 days) and in 7/13 sessions for early sessions (<7 days) (p = 0.01). Quantitative CT scan revealed a high percentage of non-aerated or poorly-aerated lung parenchyma [52 % (41–62)] in all patients. No correlation was found between CT scan data and respiratory parameter changes. Hemodynamics did not vary and side effects were rare (one membrane thrombosis and one drop in ECMO blood flow). CONCLUSION: When used in combination with VV-ECMO, 24 h of prone positioning improves both oxygenation and respiratory system compliance. Moreover, our study confirms the absence of serious adverse events.

METHODS We analyzed 319 patients (220 asymptomatic and 99 symptomatic) who underwent carotid angioplasty from 2002 until 2012 for CR that occurred after eversion endarterectomy. During this period, 7993 eversion endarterectomies were done for significant carotid artery stenosis. Significant CR was detected by ultrasound examination and confirmed by digital subtraction angiography or multidetector computed tomography angiography. After angioplasty (with or without stenting), color duplex ultrasound imaging was done after 1 month, 6 months, 1 year, and annually thereafter. End points encompassed myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death (fatal myocardial infarction, fatal cardiac failure, fatal stroke), and also puncture site hematoma and recurrent restenosis. Primary end points were analyzed as early results (≤30 days after the procedure), and secondary end points were long-term results (>30 days). Variables and risk factors influencing the early-term and long-term results were also analyzed. Median follow-up was 49.8 ± 22.8 months (range, 17-121 months). RESULTS All but one procedure ended with a technical success (99.7%). In the early postoperative period, transient ischemic attack occurred in 2.8% of the patients and stroke in 1.6%, followed by one lethal outcome (0.3%). Stent thrombosis occurred in one patient (0.3%) several hours after the angioplasty, followed by urgent surgery and graft interposition. In the long-term follow-up, there were no transient ischemic attacks or strokes, non-neurologic mortality was 3.13%, and the recurrent restenosis rate was 4.4%. The rate of non-neurologic outcomes during the follow-up was significantly higher in asymptomatic patients than in symptomatic patients (4.54% vs 0%; P = .034). The statically highest rate of transient ischemic attack was verified in patients in whom Precise (Cordis Corporation, New Brunswick, NJ) stents was used (12.2%) and a Spider Fx (Covidien, Dublin, Ireland) cerebral protection device (12.5%) was used. Female gender, coronary artery disease, plaque calcifications, and smoking history were associated with an adverse outcome after angioplasty. CONCLUSIONS Carotid artery stenting is safe and reliable procedure for CR after eversion endarterectomy treatment, with low rate of postprocedural complications. Type of stent and cerebral embolic protection device may influence the rate of postprocedural neurologic ischemic events.",jjorsh76

The goal of this update is to discuss current practices concerning antithrombosis prophylaxis and the management of recently developed anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents. The duration of prophylaxis is 1 month for oncological surgery. The recommended doses in bariatric surgery are twice daily injections of low-molecular weight heparin without exceeding a total dose of 10,000 IU/day. Dual antiplatelet therapy is necessary for 6 weeks after placement of bare-metal stents, from 6-12 months for drug-eluting stents, and 12 months after an acute coronary artery syndrome. Abrupt discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy exposes the patient to an increased risk of thrombosis. Data are insufficient to make specific recommendations for antiplatelet therapy in gastrointestinal surgery. For major digestive surgery, prescription of daily aspirin should be discussed case by case. If discontinuation of treatment is absolutely necessary, this should be as short as possible (aspirin: 3 days, ticagrelor and clopidogrel: 5 days, prasugrel: 7 days). The modalities for elective management of new oral anticoagulants are similar to those for classical vitamin K antagonists (VKA) therapy, except that any overlapping with heparin administration must be avoided. In the emergency setting, an algorithm can be proposed depending on the drug, the available coagulation tests and the interval before performing surgery.",9yvtq5ib

Our goal was to study the evolution of flow-diverter endothelialization and thrombus organization at different time points after flow-diverter treatment in giant fusiform aneurysms to better understand reasons for flow-diverter thrombosis and delayed aneurysm ruptures. MATERIALS AND METHODS Two giant anterior and 2 posterior circulation aneurysms, all of which had partially thrombosed before treatment, were studied. An unruptured, untreated posterior circulation aneurysm was used as a control. Each specimen was removed at 7 days or at 6, 9, or 13 months after flow-diverter treatment. The 3 patients who survived longer than 7 days were followed up by angiography and MR imaging. Formaldehyde-fixed paraffin-embedded sections were stained by using H&E, Van Gieson elastic, CD34, h-Caldesmon, and Picrosirius stains and studied by light microscopy. RESULTS According to angiography, aneurysms were found to be obliterated partially at 6 and 9 months and completely at 13 months. MR imaging revealed that mass effect remained unchanged in each case. Sections of the flow diverter within the normal parent artery were covered by an endothelialized fibrous layer as early as 6 months, but there was no tissue coverage or endothelialization seen even at 13 months inside the aneurysm itself. Each treated aneurysm had a thin wall with complete lack of smooth muscle cells. No signs of thrombus organization were found at any of the time points studied. CONCLUSIONS Endothelialization of the flow diverter in giant fusiform aneurysms may not occur and thrombus organization may not be initiated inside these aneurysms for as long as 1 year, which explains delayed flow-diverter thrombosis and the possibility of delayed ruptures.",o75j9nhm

The significance of delayed posttreatment residual flow occurring months after FD treatment is unknown. CASE DESCRIPTION A 76-year-old woman with a large intracranial aneurysm measuring 23.0 × 18.1 mm in the cavernous segment of the right internal carotid artery was treated with placement of a single FD (Pipeline Embolization Device, Covidien, Irvine, California, USA). Postprocedure digital subtraction angiography (DSA) demonstrated flow stagnation inside the aneurysm dome. The patient was discharged 9 days post procedure without new neurologic deficits. A 6-month follow-up DSA demonstrated delayed posttreatment residual flow into the aneurysm sac. Although she was scheduled for additional FD placement because of concern for aneurysmal rupture, the operation was not conducted due to an interim motor vehicle accident. Oral treatment with aspirin (100 mg/day) and clopidogrel (75 mg/day) was continued during her recovery. DSA performed 12 months post procedure showed that the aneurysm had completely thrombosed. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that delayed post-treatment residual flow into an aneurysm may form part of the normal clinical course post FD placement and may not preclude eventual thrombosis of the aneurysm. Larger studies are needed to determine whether more frequent follow-up DSAs after FD placement are necessary and whether all patients exhibiting delayed post-treatment residual flow into an aneurysm require additional FD placement or if watchful waiting is a more suitable course.",v2n9yedv

We compared a paclitaxel-coated balloon with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) for the treatment of symptomatic superficial femoral and popliteal artery disease. METHODS AND RESULTS The IN.PACT SFA Trial is a prospective, multicenter, single-blinded, randomized trial in which 331 patients with intermittent claudication or ischemic rest pain attributable to superficial femoral and popliteal peripheral artery disease were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to treatment with DCB or PTA. The primary efficacy end point was primary patency, defined as freedom from restenosis or clinically driven target lesion revascularization at 12 months. Baseline characteristics were similar between the 2 groups. Mean lesion length and the percentage of total occlusions for the DCB and PTA arms were 8.94 ± 4.89 and 8.81 ± 5.12 cm (P=0.82) and 25.8% and 19.5% (P=0.22), respectively. DCB resulted in higher primary patency versus PTA (82.2% versus 52.4%; P<0.001). The rate of clinically driven target lesion revascularization was 2.4% in the DCB arm in comparison with 20.6% in the PTA arm (P<0.001). There was a low rate of vessel thrombosis in both arms (1.4% after DCB and 3.7% after PTA [P=0.10]). There were no device- or procedure-related deaths and no major amputations. CONCLUSIONS In this prospective, multicenter, randomized trial, DCB was superior to PTA and had a favorable safety profile for the treatment of patients with symptomatic femoropopliteal peripheral artery disease.

The current standard in these patients is acetylsalicylic acid, despite high prevalence of yet undetected paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Aim The ATTICUS randomized trial is designed to determine whether the factor Xa inhibitor apixaban administered within 7 days after embolic stroke of undetermined source, is superior to acetylsalicylic acid for prevention of new ischemic lesions documented by brain magnetic resonance imaging within 12 months after index stroke. Design Prospective, randomized, blinded, parallel-group, open-label, German multicenter phase III trial in approximately 500 patients with embolic stroke of undetermined source. A key inclusion criterion is the presence or the planned implantation of an insertable cardiac monitor. Patients are 1:1 randomized to apixaban or acetylsalicylic acid and treated for a 12-month period. It is an event-driven trial aiming for core-lab adjudicated primary outcome events. Study outcomes The primary outcome is the occurrence of at least one new ischemic lesion identified by axial T2-weighted FLAIR magnetic resonance imaging and/or axial DWI magnetic resonance imaging at 12 months when compared with the baseline magnetic resonance imaging. Key secondary outcomes are the combination of recurrent ischemic strokes, hemorrhagic strokes, systemic embolism; combination of MACE including recurrent stroke, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular death and combination of major and clinically relevant non-major bleeding defined according to ISTH, and change of cognitive function and quality of life (EQ-5D, Stroke Impact Scale). Discussion Embolic stroke of undetermined source is caused by embolic disease and associated with a high risk of recurrent ischemic strokes and clinically silent cerebral ischemic lesions. ATTICUS will investigate the impact of atrial fibrillation detected by insertable cardiac monitor and the effects of early anticoagulation with apixaban compared with antiplatelet therapy with acetylsalicylic acid on the incidence of new ischemic lesion after embolic stroke of undetermined source.",6taai8h0

Treatment discontinuation rates in vitamin K antagonist (VKA)-treated patients are high but may be lower with non-VKA oral anticoagulant agents. OBJECTIVES The goal of this study was to describe and explore predictors of dabigatran etexilate persistence in patients with newly diagnosed AF over 2 years of follow-up. METHODS Consecutive patients newly diagnosed with AF and ≥1 stroke risk factor were followed up for 2 years. Dabigatran nonpersistence was defined as discontinuation of dabigatran for >30 days. A multivariable Cox regression model included region as well as patient clinical and sociodemographic characteristics to explore predictors of nonpersistence. RESULTS Eligible patients (N = 2,932) took ≥1 dabigatran dose; their mean age was 70.3 ± 10.2 years, and 55.3% were male. The 2-year probability of dabigatran persistence was 69.2%. Approximately 7% switched to a factor Xa inhibitor and 6% to a VKA. Approximately one-third of dabigatran discontinuations were primarily due to serious or nonserious adverse events. Patients from North America had the highest discontinuation risk, and Latin America had the lowest. Minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic AF and permanent AF were associated with a lower risk for dabigatran nonpersistence. Previous proton pump inhibitor use was associated with a higher risk for dabigatran nonpersistence. CONCLUSIONS Probability of treatment persistence with dabigatran after 2 years was approximately 70%. Nearly one-half of the patients who stopped dabigatran switched to another oral anticoagulant agent. Patients from North America, and those with paroxysmal, persistent, or symptomatic AF, may be at a higher risk for discontinuing dabigatran.",9tb9564p

RESULTS From December 2005 to December 2008, 117 patients (72 male; 45 female, aged 18-75 years) were included. Clinical presentation was mostly haemorrhage (34.2 %) and seizures (28.2 %). Most AVMs were located in the brain hemispheres (85.5 %). AVMs were <3 cm in 52.1 % of patients and ≥ 3 cm in 47.9 %. Morbidity was observed in 6/117 patients (5.1 %), related to haemorrhagic events in 2 cases and non-haemorrhagic complications in 4 cases. Five patients (4.3 %) died in relation to the treatment (bleeding in 4 patients and extensive venous thrombosis in 1). Complete occlusion of the AVM by embolisation alone was obtained in 23.5 % of patients. Complementary treatment was performed in 82.3 % of patients with partial AVM occlusion, mostly radiosurgery. CONCLUSIONS In this prospective, multicentre, European, observational series, the new liquid embolic agent proved to be suitable for BAVM embolisation, with acceptable morbidity and mortality and good efficacy. KEY POINTS • Numerous interventional techniques have been used to embolise brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). • This prospective multicentre study demonstrates the suitability of a liquid embolic agent. • The safety of treatment using Onyx is acceptable. • Such embolisation leads to complete AVM occlusion in 23.5 % of patients.",981lsckw

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy and safety of retrievable vena cava filters plus anticoagulation vs anticoagulation alone for preventing pulmonary embolism recurrence in patients presenting with acute pulmonary embolism and a high risk of recurrence. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized, open-label, blinded end point trial (PREPIC2) with 6-month follow-up conducted from August 2006 to January 2013. Hospitalized patients with acute, symptomatic pulmonary embolism associated with lower-limb vein thrombosis and at least 1 criterion for severity were assigned to retrievable inferior vena cava filter implantation plus anticoagulation (filter group; n = 200) or anticoagulation alone with no filter implantation (control group; n = 199). Initial hospitalization with ambulatory follow-up occurred in 17 French centers. INTERVENTIONS Full-dose anticoagulation for at least 6 months in all patients. Insertion of a retrievable inferior vena cava filter in patients randomized to the filter group. Filter retrieval was planned at 3 months from placement. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary efficacy outcome was symptomatic recurrent pulmonary embolism at 3 months. Secondary outcomes were recurrent pulmonary embolism at 6 months, symptomatic deep vein thrombosis, major bleeding, death at 3 and 6 months, and filter complications. RESULTS In the filter group, the filter was successfully inserted in 193 patients and was retrieved as planned in 153 of the 164 patients in whom retrieval was attempted. By 3 months, recurrent pulmonary embolism had occurred in 6 patients (3.0%; all fatal) in the filter group and in 3 patients (1.5%; 2 fatal) in the control group (relative risk with filter, 2.00 [95% CI, 0.51-7.89]; P = .50). Results were similar at 6 months. No difference was observed between the 2 groups regarding the other outcomes. Filter thrombosis occurred in 3 patients. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among hospitalized patients with severe acute pulmonary embolism, the use of a retrievable inferior vena cava filter plus anticoagulation compared with anticoagulation alone did not reduce the risk of symptomatic recurrent pulmonary embolism at 3 months. These findings do not support the use of this type of filter in patients who can be treated with anticoagulation. TRIAL REGISTRATION clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00457158.",otd3j630

Treatment has changed in recent decades from open surgery to management with flexible endoscopy, resulting in lower morbidity and mortality. The goal of this study was to present the largest series, with the longest follow-up, of patients with Zenker's diverticulum receiving outpatient treatment with flexible endoscopy using a diverticuloscope and Ligasure (Covidien, Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States), a device that allows tissue sealing and coagulation of vessels before cutting the septum between the diverticulum and esophagus. Patients and methods We performed 79 diverticulotomies in 69 patients (65.2 % male, mean age 73.4 years). The mean diverticulum size was 2.8 cm. In three cases with a diverticulum ≤ 1.5 cm, the diverticuloscope could not be placed. Results The technical success was 95.83 % and the clinical success 96.7 %: 84 % of the 56 patients followed for a mean of 34.6 months (24 - 64 months) had no dysphagia. The recurrence rate was 10.4 %, with a good response to a second diverticulotomy at 12 months (IQR: 11.5 - 17) in most cases. The most severe complications were two microperforations, resolved with conservative treatment, and one case of delayed bleeding endoscopically-controlled with a clip. Conclusions Diverticulotomy of the esophageal-diverticular septum with Ligasure is an outpatient endoscopic technique that is simple, effective in the long term and very safe for the treatment of patients with Zenker's diverticulum. In symptomatic recurrences, a second procedure was equally safe and effective in most patients.",3jkw4o66

METHODS AND RESULTS Five randomized controlled trials encompassing 10,350 patients were included. Primary efficacy and safety endpoints were all-cause death and major bleeding, respectively. All-cause death at 30 days did not significantly differ with bivalirudin compared to heparin (odds ratio (OR) 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74-1.28; P=0.84). Major bleeding was significantly reduced by bivalirudin compared to heparin (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.40-0.85; P=0.005). Bivalirudin use was associated with non-significantly different rates of 30-day definite stent thrombosis (ST) (OR 1.71, 95% CI 0.84-3.49; P=0.14), albeit with higher rates of acute ST (OR 3.55, 95% CI 1.67-7.56; P=0.001) and non-significantly different rates of subacute ST (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.46-1.61; P=0.64). There were non-significant differences in the 30-day rates of reinfarction (OR 1.47, 95% CI 0.94-2.30; P=0.10) and cardiovascular death (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.56-1.02; P=0.07). There were no significant interactions between bailout versus routine GPI use in the heparin arm for any of the safety or efficacy outcomes (all Pinteraction>0.10). CONCLUSIONS Bivalirudin compared with heparin was associated with comparable 30-day rates of mortality with reduced major bleeding, at the price of an increased risk of acute ST, with non-significant differences in the overall 30-day rates of ST and reinfarction. Intended use of GPI in the heparin arm did not significantly modify the treatment effects of bivalirudin. Given the important differences between trials, as well as evolution in technique and adjunct pharmacotherapy, further randomized trials are warranted to discriminate whether there are substantial safety and efficacy differences between these agents during primary PCI in STEMI.",m7hihuda

Deciding to stop or continue anticoagulant therapy indefinitely after completing 3 to 6 months of initial treatment requires balancing the long-term risk of recurrent VTE if anticoagulation is stopped against the long-term risk of major bleeding if anticoagulation is continued. However, knowledge of the long-term risk for major bleeding events during extended anticoagulation in this patient population is limited. We plan to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to quantify the risk for major bleeding events during extended oral anticoagulation in patients with first unprovoked VTE. METHODS Electronic databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials will be systematically searched with the assistance of an information specialist (from inception to March 1, 2019) to identify randomized controlled trials and prospective cohort studies reporting major bleeding during extended oral anticoagulation in patients with first unprovoked VTE, who have completed at least 3 months of initial anticoagulant therapy. Study selection, risk of bias assessment, and data extraction will be performed independently by at least two investigators. The number of major bleeding events and person-years of follow-up will be used to calculate the rate (events per 100 person-years) with its 95% confidence interval for each study cohort, during clinically relevant time periods of extended anticoagulant therapy. Results will be pooled using random effect meta-analysis. DISCUSSION The planned systematic review and meta-analysis will provide reliable estimates of the risk for major bleeding events during extended anticoagulation. This information will help inform patient prognosis and assist clinicians with balancing the risks and benefits of treatment to guide management of unprovoked VTE.

The Contour device is designed to target the neck of an aneurysm and cause flow disruption within the aneurysm hence promoting thrombosis and neo-endothelialization at the neck. This article presents initial experiences with the Contour. METHODS The prospectively maintained database was retrospectively reviewed to identify patients treated with the Contour device. Demographic data, aneurysm characteristics, clinical result, and clinical and radiological follow-up information were recorded. RESULTS The review identified 3 patients (2 female), with 3 unruptured aneurysms, of average age 67 ± 8.7 years (range 62-77 years). The aneurysms were all located in the anterior circulation including one pericallosal, one at the A1-2 junction and one on the ICA bifurcation. The mean average dome height was 7.6 ± 0.62 mm (range 7.1-8.3 mm), dome width 5.7 ± 2 mm (range 3.5-7.5 mm), and neck width 3.6 ± 0.95 mm (range 2.5-4.2 mm). At follow-up angiography two of the aneurysms were completely occluded and one device had displaced into the aneurysm sac due to inappropriate positioning of the device. Of the patients one had minor stroke during the postoperative period but returned to baseline neurology. All patients were mRS 0 at last follow-up. CONCLUSION The Contour is a promising new aneurysm occlusion device. Further studies with longer term follow-up are required to determine the efficacy of this novel device.",bz6ep8s2

We sought to identify risk factors of post-hospital discharge VTE events following colorectal surgery. METHODS The NSQIP database was utilized to examine patients developed VTE after hospital discharge following colorectal surgery during 2005-2013. Multivariate analysis using logistic regression was performed to quantify risk factors of VTE after discharge. RESULTS We evaluated a total of 219,477 patients underwent colorectal resections. The overall incidence of VTE was 2.1 % (4556). 33.8 % (1541) of all VTE events occurred after hospital discharge. The length of postoperative hospitalization had a strong association with post-discharge VTE, with the highest risk in patients who were hospitalized for more than 1 week after operation (AOR 9.08, P < 0.01). Other factors associated with post-discharge VTE included chronic steroid use (AOR 1.81, P < 0.01), stage 4 colorectal cancer (AOR 1.40, P = 0.03), obesity (AOR 1.37, P < 0.01), age >70 (AOR 1.21, P = 0.04), and open surgery (AOR 1.36, P < 0.01). Patients who were hospitalized for more than 1 week after an open colorectal resections had a 12 times higher risk of post-discharge VTE event compared to patients hospitalized less than 4 days after a laparoscopic resection (AOR 12.34, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS VTE is uncommon following colorectal resections; however, a significant proportion occurs after patients are discharged from the hospital (33.8 %). The length of postoperative hospitalization appears to have a strong association with post-discharge VTE. High-risk patients may benefit from continued VTE prophylaxis after discharge.",5089wqdx

OBJECTIVES To investigate the timing of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) onset secondary to spinal cord injury without anticoagulant therapies. SETTING Spinal Cord Injury Center in Hokkaido, Japan. METHODS Between November 2012 and June 2013, patients with spinal cord injury who were admitted to our hospital within 1 day after the injury and treated surgically within 24 h underwent a neurological examination, leg vein ultrasonography and D-dimer test 1, 3, 7, 14 and 28 days after surgery. All patients received treatment with intermittent pneumatic compression and elastic stockings, but without any anticoagulant. RESULTS DVT developed in 12 patients (11 men and 1 women), with a mean age of 62.2 years (range, 41-80 years; mean age of total sample, 63.2 years (range, 25-78 years)), all distal to the popliteal vein. DVT occurred more often with a more severe paralysis (66.3%, AIS A and B). The median (± standard error) length of time from the operation to DVT detection was 7.5±2.2 days. The mean D-dimer level upon DVT detection was 14.6±11.8 μg ml(-1), with no significant differences between those who developed DVT and those who did not at any of the time points. CONCLUSION These results suggest that DVT can develop at the very-acute stage of spinal cord injury and the incidence increases with a more severe paralysis. DVT detection was more reliable with ultrasonography, which should be used with DVT-preventive measures, beginning immediately after the injury, for the management of patients with spinal cord injury.",k2kxy525

The administration of recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin (rhTM), which has both anti-inflammatory and anticoagulant activities, improves outcomes and respiratory function in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Therefore, we conducted a prospective clinical study to examine the effects of rhTM on respiratory function, coagulation markers, and outcomes for patients with AE-IPF. METHODS: After registration of the protocol, the patients with AE-IPF who satisfied the study inclusion criteria were treated daily with 380 U/kg of rhTM for 7 days and steroid pulse therapy. The concomitant administration of immunosuppressants and polymyxin B-immobilized fiber column treatment was prohibited. The sample size was 10 subjects. The primary study outcome was the improvement of PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio a week after treatment initiation. Secondary outcomes were change in D-dimer level over time and 28-day survival rate in patients without intubation. Study data were compared with historical untreated comparison group, including 13 patients with AE-IPF who were treated without rhTM before the registration. RESULTS: The mean PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio for the rhTM treatment group (n = 10) on day 8 significantly improved compared with that on day one (two-way analysis of variance, p = 0.01). The mean D-dimer level tended to decrease in the rhTM group on day 8, but the change was not significant. The 28-day survival rate was 50 % higher in the rhTM group than in the historical untreated comparison group, but the difference was not significant. A post hoc analysis showed that overall survival time was significantly longer in the treated group compared with that of the historical untreated comparison group (p = 0.04, log-rank test). CONCLUSION: rhTM plus steroid pulse therapy improves respiratory functions in patients with AE-IPF and is expected to improve overall patient survival without using other combination therapies. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered with University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trial Registry (UMIN-CTR) in October 2012 (UMIN000009082).",qa8e90qv

Meanwhile, the risk factors associated with the disease progression still remain elusive. METHODS: A cohort of 17 patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infections who were admitted to the Ninth Hospital of Nanchang between January 28 and February 6, 2020, were enrolled in this study. All the patients received standardized treatment. The disease progression was evaluated every 7 days after admission. The clinical, radiologic, and laboratory characteristics were retrospectively analyzed, and the factors associated with the disease progression were screened by binary logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The cohort comprised 11 women (64.7%) and 6 men (35.3%) between the ages of 18 to 70 years old. All patients had a reported history of contact with infection-confirmed patients. Fever (11/64.7%) and cough (8/47.1%) were the most common symptoms, whereas dyspnea (2/11.8%) and fatigue (3/17.6%) were rare, and there was no patient with diarrhea symptoms. There were 5 patients with aggravated disease at the first disease progression evaluation, and no patient received mechanical ventilation, transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU), or progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, refractory metabolic acidosis, coagulation dysfunction, or death. Based on the disease progression, patients were divided into the non-aggravation group (12 cases) and the aggravation group (5 cases). There were no significant differences between the 2 groups with respect to their clinical characteristics. Chest computed tomography (CT) on admission revealed there were 8 patients (47.1%) with invasive lesions found bilaterally on the lungs on multiple lobes, 4 patients (23.5%) with invasive lesions on 1 lobe, and 5 patients (29.4%) with normal chest CT. The aggravation group had1 patient (20.0%) with invasive lesions on one lobe, 3 (60.0%) with invasive lesions on multiple lobes, bilaterally, and 1 (20.0%) with normal chest CT; meanwhile, the nonaggravation group had 3 patients (25.0%) with invasive lesions on one lobe, 5 (41.7%) with invasive lesions on multiple lobes, bilaterally, and 4 (33.3%) with normal chest CT. No significant difference was found between the 2 groups. In the aggravation group, the total lymphocyte counts significantly decreased in comparison to that in the non-aggravation group. Further analysis showed that the CD4+ T cell count but not the CD8+ T cell count of the aggravation group was significantly lower than that of the non-aggravation group. Correlation analysis indicated total lymphocyte count was positively correlated with CD4+ T cell count, and no significant differences were found between the 2 groups in other laboratory measurements, including those of white blood cell (WBC) count, C-reactive protein (CRP), albumin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and D-dimer. Finally, a binary logistic regression model was used to identify the factors associated with the disease progression. It was found that total lymphocyte count was a risk factor associated with disease progression in patients infected with 2019-nCoV. CONCLUSIONS: A higher cell count of total lymphocytes may indicate a better outcome of the disease, and immune response may be a vital factor for directing disease progression in the early stage of 2019-nCoV infection.",4qp881mk

Meanwhile, the risk factors associated with the disease progression still remain elusive. METHODS A cohort of 17 patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infections who were admitted to the Ninth Hospital of Nanchang between January 28 and February 6, 2020, were enrolled in this study. All the patients received standardized treatment. The disease progression was evaluated every 7 days after admission. The clinical, radiologic, and laboratory characteristics were retrospectively analyzed, and the factors associated with the disease progression were screened by binary logistic regression analysis. RESULTS The cohort comprised 11 women (64.7%) and 6 men (35.3%) between the ages of 18 to 70 years old. All patients had a reported history of contact with infection-confirmed patients. Fever (11/64.7%) and cough (8/47.1%) were the most common symptoms, whereas dyspnea (2/11.8%) and fatigue (3/17.6%) were rare, and there was no patient with diarrhea symptoms. There were 5 patients with aggravated disease at the first disease progression evaluation, and no patient received mechanical ventilation, transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU), or progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, refractory metabolic acidosis, coagulation dysfunction, or death. Based on the disease progression, patients were divided into the non-aggravation group (12 cases) and the aggravation group (5 cases). There were no significant differences between the 2 groups with respect to their clinical characteristics. Chest computed tomography (CT) on admission revealed there were 8 patients (47.1%) with invasive lesions found bilaterally on the lungs on multiple lobes, 4 patients (23.5%) with invasive lesions on 1 lobe, and 5 patients (29.4%) with normal chest CT. The aggravation group had1 patient (20.0%) with invasive lesions on one lobe, 3 (60.0%) with invasive lesions on multiple lobes, bilaterally, and 1 (20.0%) with normal chest CT; meanwhile, the nonaggravation group had 3 patients (25.0%) with invasive lesions on one lobe, 5 (41.7%) with invasive lesions on multiple lobes, bilaterally, and 4 (33.3%) with normal chest CT. No significant difference was found between the 2 groups. In the aggravation group, the total lymphocyte counts significantly decreased in comparison to that in the non-aggravation group. Further analysis showed that the CD4+ T cell count but not the CD8+ T cell count of the aggravation group was significantly lower than that of the non-aggravation group. Correlation analysis indicated total lymphocyte count was positively correlated with CD4+ T cell count, and no significant differences were found between the 2 groups in other laboratory measurements, including those of white blood cell (WBC) count, C-reactive protein (CRP), albumin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and D-dimer. Finally, a binary logistic regression model was used to identify the factors associated with the disease progression. It was found that total lymphocyte count was a risk factor associated with disease progression in patients infected with 2019-nCoV. CONCLUSIONS A higher cell count of total lymphocytes may indicate a better outcome of the disease, and immune response may be a vital factor for directing disease progression in the early stage of 2019-nCoV infection.",z3rpoqao

We compared a paclitaxel-coated balloon with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) for the treatment of symptomatic superficial femoral and popliteal artery disease. METHODS AND RESULTS The IN.PACT SFA Trial is a prospective, multicenter, single-blinded, randomized trial in which 331 patients with intermittent claudication or ischemic rest pain attributable to superficial femoral and popliteal peripheral artery disease were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to treatment with DCB or PTA. The primary efficacy end point was primary patency, defined as freedom from restenosis or clinically driven target lesion revascularization at 12 months. Baseline characteristics were similar between the 2 groups. Mean lesion length and the percentage of total occlusions for the DCB and PTA arms were 8.94 ± 4.89 and 8.81 ± 5.12 cm (P=0.82) and 25.8% and 19.5% (P=0.22), respectively. DCB resulted in higher primary patency versus PTA (82.2% versus 52.4%; P<0.001). The rate of clinically driven target lesion revascularization was 2.4% in the DCB arm in comparison with 20.6% in the PTA arm (P<0.001). There was a low rate of vessel thrombosis in both arms (1.4% after DCB and 3.7% after PTA [P=0.10]). There were no device- or procedure-related deaths and no major amputations. CONCLUSIONS In this prospective, multicenter, randomized trial, DCB was superior to PTA and had a favorable safety profile for the treatment of patients with symptomatic femoropopliteal peripheral artery disease.

Paclitaxel-eluting balloon (PEB) angioplasty, stenting, and directional atherectomy (DA) have provided new options for the treatment of superficial femoral artery disease; however, the comparative efficacy of these interventional strategies remains uncertain. METHODS One hundred and fifty-five patients with symptomatic peripheral artery disease due to de novo superficial femoral artery stenotic or occlusive lesions were randomized to treatment with plain balloon angioplasty (BA) followed by PEB angioplasty and stenting (n=48), BA and stenting (n=52), or DA with distal protection and bailout stenting (n=55). The primary end point of the study was percentage diameter stenosis after 6 months measured by angiography. Other end points included target lesion revascularization, thrombosis, ipsilateral amputation, binary restenosis, and all-cause mortality at 6 and 24 months. RESULTS Baseline and lesion characteristics were comparable in all groups with a mean lesion length of 65.9±46.8 mm and 56% total occlusions. At 6 months angiography, the percent diameter stenosis was significantly lower in patients treated by PEB angioplasty and stenting (34±31%) as compared with BA angioplasty and stenting (56±29%, P=0.009) or DA (55±29%, P=0.007). Similarly, binary restenosis was significantly lower after treatment with PEB and stenting as compared with BA and stenting or DA. Clinical follow-up at 24 months revealed a lower risk for target lesion revascularization after PEB angioplasty and stenting as compared with BA and stenting or DA. We found no difference in terms of target lesion thrombosis and mortality among groups, and no patient underwent amputation. CONCLUSIONS Treatment of de novo superficial femoral artery lesions with PEB angioplasty and stenting is superior to BA angioplasty and stenting or DA in terms of angiographic diameter stenosis at 6 months and target lesion revascularization at 24 months.

Those in the treatment group (n=259) received 0.1 mg halofuginone base per kg bodyweight daily in a 10 ml solution, for the first seven days following birth, while those in the control group (n=254) received an equal volume of a placebo solution. Faecal samples were collected weekly from all calves until three weeks of age to test for Cryptosporidium oocysts and to assess the diarrhoeal status. Growth parameters of the calves were also recorded at approximately four months of age. Calves that received halofuginone were significantly less likely to shed Cryptosporidium oocysts during the course of the study than placebo-treated calves (odds ratio 0.6, 95 per cent confidence interval 0.4 to 0.9, P=0.009). Mean growth measurements of calves in the treated group were consistently higher than those of the control calves (hipometer-derived P=0.052, wither height P=0.097) and mortality was lower in the treated group (P=0.07).

The Solitaire AB stent (Covidien, Irvine, California), the only fully retrieved stent, assists in the coiling of wide-neck intracranial aneurysms. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the mid-term angiographic follow-up of wide-necked aneurysms treated with the Solitaire AB stent. METHODS SOLARE (SOLitaire Aneurysm Remodeling) is a consecutive, prospective study conducted in 7 European centers. A core laboratory evaluated the postoperative and mid-term (6 month ± 15 days) angiographic results by using the Raymond classification Scale. Recanalization was defined as worsening, and progressive thrombosis was defined as improvement in the Raymond scale score. RESULTS The mean width of the aneurysm sac was 7.5 mm, and the mean diameter of the aneurysm neck was 4.7 mm. Angiographic mid-term follow-up was obtained in 55 of 65 aneurysms (85.9%). Complete occlusion was achieved in 33 aneurysms (60%); a neck remnant was seen in 16 aneurysms (29.1%) and an aneurysm remnant in 6 aneurysms (10.9%). Of 55 aneurysms, recanalization was observed in 8 aneurysms (14.5%), and progressive thrombosis was observed in 17 aneurysms (30.9%). No bleeding or rebleeding was observed during the follow-up period.

American journal of neuroradiology,Risk Factors for Hemorrhagic Complications following Pipeline Embolization Device Treatment of Intracranial Aneurysms: Results from the International Retrospective Study of the Pipeline Embolization Device.," AND PURPOSE Spontaneous intraparenchymal hemorrhage is a dreaded complication of unknown etiology following flow-diversion treatment. Using the International Retrospective Study of the Pipeline Embolization Device registry, we studied demographic, aneurysm, and procedural characteristics associated with intraparenchymal hemorrhage following Pipeline Embolization Device treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS We identified patients in the International Retrospective Study of the Pipeline Embolization Device registry with intraparenchymal hemorrhage unrelated to index aneurysm rupture post-Pipeline Embolization Device treatment. The rate of intraparenchymal hemorrhage was determined by baseline demographics, comorbidities, aneurysm characteristics, and procedural characteristics (including anticoagulation use, platelet testing, number of devices used, sheaths, catheters, and guidewires). Categoric variables were compared with χ(2) testing, and continuous variables were compared with the Student t test. RESULTS Of 793 patients with 906 aneurysms, 20 (2.5%) had intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Fifteen intraparenchymal hemorrhages (75.0%) occurred within 30 days of treatment (median, 5 days; range, 0-150 days). Nine patients with intraparenchymal hemorrhage (45.0%) died, 10 (50.0%) had major neurologic morbidity, and 1 had minor neurologic morbidity (5.0%). Intraparenchymal hemorrhage was ipsilateral to the Pipeline Embolization Device in 16 patients (80%) and contralateral in 3 patients (15.0%). Variables associated with higher odds of intraparenchymal hemorrhage included treatment of ruptured aneurysms (OR, 4.44; 95% CI, 1.65-11.94; P = .005) and the use of ≥ 3 Pipeline Embolization Devices (OR, 4.10; 95% CI, 1.34-12.58; P = .04). The Shuttle sheath was not associated with intraparenchymal hemorrhage (OR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.38-2.45; P = .95). CONCLUSIONS Spontaneous intraparenchymal hemorrhage following Pipeline Embolization Device treatment is a rare-but-devastating complication, with nearly all patients having morbidity or mortality. Variables associated with intraparenchymal hemorrhage included the use of multiple Pipeline Embolization Devices and treatment of ruptured aneurysms. The Shuttle, a device that was previously thought to be associated with intraparenchymal hemorrhage, was not associated with it.",o0e363e1

This study aimed to investigate the impact of heparin use during endovascular therapy of anterior circulation tandem occlusions on the functional and safety outcomes. METHODS A retrospective analysis of the multicenter observational TITAN registry was performed. Patients with anterior circulation tandem occlusion and treated with endovascular therapy (EVT) were included, with or without extracranial carotid intervention. We divided patients into two groups based on periprocedural heparin use (heparin vs. non-heparin). The dose of intravenous unfractionated heparin ranged from 1500 to 2500 I.U. Primary study endpoint was 90-day Modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Secondary study endpoint included angiographic and safety endpoints such as hemorrhagic complications. A propensity-score-matched analysis was performed. RESULTS Among 369 patients, heparin was used in 68 patients (18.4%). In the propensity-score-matched cohort, favorable outcome (mRS 0-2) occurred in 51.3% in heparin group and 58.0% in non-heparin group (matched OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.32-1.78; P = 0.52). Similar result was found in propensity-score-adjusted cohort (adjusted OR, 0.72; 95%CI, 0.39-1.32; P = 0.28). Likewise, there was no difference in the rate of successful reperfusion (mTICI 2b-3) (propensity-score-adjusted OR, 1.03; 95%CI, 0.50-2.09; P = 0.93) neither in safety endpoints between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS Periprocedural heparin use during EVT of anterior circulation tandem occlusions was not associated with better functional, angiographic or safety outcomes. These findings are applicable for low doses of heparin, and further studies are warranted.",ez7h89ta

This study analyzed the risk factors and management of hemorrhagic complications, such as hemoperitoneum, hemothorax, and hemobilia. METHODS We performed 4133 RFA treatments in 2154 patients with primary and metastatic liver tumors from February 1999 to December 2007. Of these, we enrolled patients with hemorrhagic complications and reviewed their medical records thoroughly. The risk factors for each hemorrhagic complication were analyzed using unconditional logistic regression. RESULTS Hemorrhagic complications occurred in 63 out of 4133 treatments (1.5%), including hemoperitoneum in 29 (0.7%), hemothorax in 14 (0.3%), and hemobilia in 20 (0.5%). Eleven, 8, and 4 of these patients, respectively, were categorized as major complications requiring blood transfusion or drainage. Two patients died after hemoperitoneum. Logistic regression analysis revealed large tumor size [odds ratio (OR) 1.06 per 1 mm increase in diameter] and low platelet count (OR 0.88 per 10,000/microL increase) were significant risk factors for hemoperitoneum. The location of tumor nodules was a significant risk factor for hemothorax (segment 7, OR 2.31) and hemobilia (segment 1, OR 3.30). Other factors, including the number of needle insertions or the duration of ablation, were not significant. CONCLUSIONS Although hemorrhagic complications were relatively rare with percutaneous RFA, specific treatments, such as blood transfusion and drainage, were required in some cases. Care must be taken, especially in high-risk patients.",o692zuj6

This study assesses its efficacy in patients admitted to critical care following cardiovascular surgery and the influence of standard antithrombotic agents routinely used in this specific group. METHODS Consecutive cardiovascular surgery patients treated with post-dilution hemofiltration with RCA were included in this prospective observational study. The primary outcome of the study was CRRT circuit life-span adjusted for reasons other than clotting. The secondary outcome evaluated the influence of standard antithrombotic agents (acetylsalicylic acid [ASA], low molecular weight heparin [LMWH] or fondaparinux as thromboprophylaxis or treatment dose with or without ASA) on filter life. RESULTS Fifty-two patients underwent 193 sessions of CVVH, after exclusion of 15 sessions where unfractionated heparin was administered. The median filter life span was 58 hours. Filter life span was significantly longer in patients receiving therapeutic dose of LMWH or fondaparinux (79 h [2-110]), in comparison to patients treated with prophylactic dose of LMWH or fondaparinux (51 h [7-117], p < 0.001), and patients without antithrombotic prophylaxis (42 h [2-91], p < 0.0001). 12 bleeding episodes were observed; 8 occurred in patients receiving treatment dose anticoagulation, 3 in patients receiving prophylactic dose anticoagulation and 1 in a patient with no antithrombotic prophylaxis. CONCLUSIONS A post dilution hemofiltration with RCA provides prolonged filter life span when adjusted for reasons other than clotting. Patients receiving treatment dose anticoagulation had a significantly longer filter life span than those who were on prophylactic doses or ASA alone.",stmu1j0j

METHODS We searched PubMed until May 31, 2012, for randomized clinical trials using the following search items: atrial fibrillation, anticoagulation, warfarin, and previous stroke or transient ischemic attack. Studies had to be phase III trials in atrial fibrillation patients comparing warfarin with a non-VKA currently on the market or with the intention to be brought to the market in North America or Europe. Analysis was performed on intention-to-treat basis. A fixed-effects model was used as more appropriate than a random-effects model when combining a small number of studies. RESULTS Among 47 potentially eligible articles, 3 were included in the meta-analysis. In 14 527 patients, non-VKAs were associated with a significant reduction of stroke/systemic embolism (odds ratios, 0.85 [95% CI, 074-0.99]; relative risk reduction, 14%; absolute risk reduction, 0.7%; number needed to treat, 134 over 1.8-2.0 years) compared with warfarin. Non-VKAs were also associated with a significant reduction of major bleeding compared with warfarin (odds ratios, 0.86 [95% CI, 075-0.99]; relative risk reduction, 13%; absolute risk reduction, 0.8%; number needed to treat, 125), mainly driven by the significant reduction of hemorrhagic stroke (odds ratios, 0.44 [95% CI, 032-0.62]; relative risk reduction, 57.9%; absolute risk reduction, 0.7%; number needed to treat, 139). CONCLUSIONS In the context of the significant limitations of combining the results of disparate trials of different agents, non-VKAs seem to be associated with a significant reduction in rates of stroke or systemic embolism, hemorrhagic stroke, and major bleeding when compared with warfarin in patients with previous stroke or transient ischemic attack.",avpn7343

METHODS Patients with stroke on treatment with a NOAC were prospectively enrolled in this multicentre observational study between February 2012 and 2015. Brain imaging at admission and follow-up imaging until day 7 were reviewed for HT. Functional outcome was assessed by the modified Rankin scale (mRS) before the index event, at discharge, and at 3-months. RESULTS 231 patients without recanalisation therapy (no-RT), and 32 patients with RT were eligible for analysis. Any HT was present at admission in 9/231 no-RT patients (3.9%, 95% CI 2.0 to 7.3) and in none of the patients with RT. In patients with follow-up imaging (no-RT, n=129, and RT, n=32), HT was present in 14.0% (no-RT; 95% CI, 8.9 to 21.1), and 40.6% (RT, 95% CI, 25.5 to 57.8), respectively. After adjustment for stroke severity, this difference between the no-RT and RT groups became non-significant. Symptomatic ICH was observed in 1 patient per group. HT was not associated with unfavourable outcome (mRS 3-6) at 3-months in multivariable analysis. Resumption of OAC after stroke was delayed in patients with HT compared to those without (15 d [IQR, 5-26] vs. 1 d [0-4], P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS The frequency and severity of HT after stroke on NOAC appears similar to previous reports for vitamin K antagonists and no anticoagulation. Whether asymptomatic HT should delay resumption of preventive anticoagulation requires further investigation.",yolk4hx7

METHODS In this retrospective monocentric observational study, we included 95 patients treated for ilio-femoral PTVLs. We proposed a four-grade scale evaluating the severity of PTVLS caudal to the common femoral vein based on CT phlebography and per-operative phlebography. For most patients, venous patency was assessed with color duplex ultrasonography and the clinical efficacy of the intervention using the Villalta and CIVIQ scores. RESULTS Recanalization was successful in 100% of patients with a morbidity rate of 4%. After a mean follow-up of 21 months, the overall primary patency was 75%, the assisted primary patency 82%, and the secondary patency 93%. Secondary patency was 100% for grade 0-1, 90% for grade 2, and 63% for grade 3 (p < 0.002). There was no correlation between the extension of stenting caudally of the common femoral vein and venous patency. The mean improvements in the Villalta and CIVIQ-20 scores were, respectively, 4.6 (p < 0.0001) and 18 (p < 0.0001); scores were not correlated with the grade of PTVLs in the thigh. CONCLUSION Venous patency after endovascular treatment of ilio-femoral PTVLs was strongly linked to the severity of PTVLs caudal to the common femoral vein but not to the extent of stenting.",yo1wdyrl

The goal of this update is to discuss current practices concerning antithrombosis prophylaxis and the management of recently developed anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents. The duration of prophylaxis is 1 month for oncological surgery. The recommended doses in bariatric surgery are twice daily injections of low-molecular weight heparin without exceeding a total dose of 10,000 IU/day. Dual antiplatelet therapy is necessary for 6 weeks after placement of bare-metal stents, from 6-12 months for drug-eluting stents, and 12 months after an acute coronary artery syndrome. Abrupt discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy exposes the patient to an increased risk of thrombosis. Data are insufficient to make specific recommendations for antiplatelet therapy in gastrointestinal surgery. For major digestive surgery, prescription of daily aspirin should be discussed case by case. If discontinuation of treatment is absolutely necessary, this should be as short as possible (aspirin: 3 days, ticagrelor and clopidogrel: 5 days, prasugrel: 7 days). The modalities for elective management of new oral anticoagulants are similar to those for classical vitamin K antagonists (VKA) therapy, except that any overlapping with heparin administration must be avoided. In the emergency setting, an algorithm can be proposed depending on the drug, the available coagulation tests and the interval before performing surgery.",9yvtq5ib

DESIGN A consensus committee of 68 international experts representing 30 international organizations was convened. Nominal groups were assembled at key international meetings (for those committee members attending the conference). A formal conflict of interest policy was developed at the onset of the process and enforced throughout. The entire guidelines process was conducted independent of any industry funding. A stand-alone meeting was held for all subgroup heads, co- and vice-chairs, and selected individuals. Teleconferences and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee served as an integral part of the development.

RESULTS Key recommendations and suggestions, listed by category, include: early quantitative resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 hrs after recognition (1C); blood cultures before antibiotic therapy (1C); imaging studies performed promptly to confirm a potential source of infection (UG); administration of broad-spectrum antimicrobials therapy within 1 hr of recognition of septic shock (1B) and severe sepsis without septic shock (1C) as the goal of therapy; reassessment of antimicrobial therapy daily for de-escalation, when appropriate (1B); infection source control with attention to the balance of risks and benefits of the chosen method within 12 hrs of diagnosis (1C); initial fluid resuscitation with crystalloid (1B) and consideration of the addition of albumin in patients who continue to require substantial amounts of crystalloid to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure (2C) and the avoidance of hetastarch formulations (1C); initial fluid challenge in patients with sepsis-induced tissue hypoperfusion and suspicion of hypovolemia to achieve a minimum of 30 mL/kg of crystalloids (more rapid administration and greater amounts of fluid may be needed in some patients) (1C); fluid challenge technique continued as long as hemodynamic improvement, as based on either dynamic or static variables (UG); norepinephrine as the first-choice vasopressor to maintain mean arterial pressure ≥ 65 mm Hg (1B); epinephrine when an additional agent is needed to maintain adequate blood pressure (2B); vasopressin (0.03 U/min) can be added to norepinephrine to either raise mean arterial pressure to target or to decrease norepinephrine dose but should not be used as the initial vasopressor (UG); dopamine is not recommended except in highly selected circumstances (2C); dobutamine infusion administered or added to vasopressor in the presence of a) myocardial dysfunction as suggested by elevated cardiac filling pressures and low cardiac output, or b) ongoing signs of hypoperfusion despite achieving adequate intravascular volume and adequate mean arterial pressure (1C); avoiding use of intravenous hydrocortisone in adult septic shock patients if adequate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy are able to restore hemodynamic stability (2C); hemoglobin target of 7-9 g/dL in the absence of tissue hypoperfusion, ischemic coronary artery disease, or acute hemorrhage (1B); low tidal volume (1A) and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure (1B) for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); application of at least a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in ARDS (1B); higher rather than lower level of PEEP for patients with sepsis-induced moderate or severe ARDS (2C); recruitment maneuvers in sepsis patients with severe refractory hypoxemia due to ARDS (2C); prone positioning in sepsis-induced ARDS patients with a PaO2/FIO2 ratio of ≤ 100 mm Hg in facilities that have experience with such practices (2C); head-of-bed elevation in mechanically ventilated patients unless contraindicated (1B); a conservative fluid strategy for patients with established ARDS who do not have evidence of tissue hypoperfusion (1C); protocols for weaning and sedation (1A); minimizing use of either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation targeting specific titration endpoints (1B); avoidance of neuromuscular blockers if possible in the septic patient without ARDS (1C); a short course of neuromuscular blocker (no longer than 48 hrs) for patients with early ARDS and a Pao2/Fio2 < 150 mm Hg (2C); a protocolized approach to blood glucose management commencing insulin dosing when two consecutive blood glucose levels are > 180 mg/dL, targeting an upper blood glucose ≤ 180 mg/dL (1A); equivalency of continuous veno-venous hemofiltration or intermittent hemodialysis (2B); prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (1B); use of stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with bleeding risk factors (1B); oral or enteral (if necessary) feedings, as tolerated, rather than either complete fasting or provision of only intravenous glucose within the first 48 hrs after a diagnosis of severe sepsis/septic shock (2C); and addressing goals of care, including treatment plans and end-of-life planning (as appropriate) (1B), as early as feasible, but within 72 hrs of intensive care unit admission (2C). Recommendations specific to pediatric severe sepsis include: therapy with face mask oxygen, high flow nasal cannula oxygen, or nasopharyngeal continuous PEEP in the presence of respiratory distress and hypoxemia (2C), use of physical examination therapeutic endpoints such as capillary refill (2C); for septic shock associated with hypovolemia, the use of crystalloids or albumin to deliver a bolus of 20 mL/kg of crystalloids (or albumin equivalent) over 5 to 10 mins (2C); more common use of inotropes and vasodilators for low cardiac output septic shock associated with elevated systemic vascular resistance (2C); and use of hydrocortisone only in children with suspected or proven ""absolute""' adrenal insufficiency (2C). CONCLUSIONS Strong agreement existed among a large cohort of international experts regarding many level 1 recommendations for the best care of patients with severe sepsis. Although a significant number of aspects of care have relatively weak support, evidence-based recommendations regarding the acute management of sepsis and septic shock are the foundation of improved outcomes for this important group of critically ill patients.",1uwyrst6

The Flow Re-direction Endoluminal Device (FRED) is a relatively new flow diverter with a unique dual-layer design. We report our experience and short-term results with the FRED. MATERIALS AND METHODS We did a retrospective review of all consecutive cases in which the FRED was used to treat intracranial aneurysms at a single institution from March 2014 till December 2015. Clinical parameters, aneurysm characteristics, technical results and short-term outcomes were reviewed. RESULTS Eleven intracranial aneurysms were treated with the FRED in 11 patients. The technical device deployment success rate was 100%. Immediate reduction in intra-aneurysmal flow after deployment was noted in 10 cases. The aneurysm occlusion rate at 6 months was 75%. There was 1 complication of in-stent thrombosis immediately after deployment. There was no side branch occlusion, delayed aneurysm rupture, stroke, or intraparenchymal haemorrhage. There was no neurological deficit, morbidity, or mortality. CONCLUSION The FRED is a new FD. It has shown to be safe and effective in our series. The unique dual-layer design of the device renders it to have technical advantages over other FDs. The 6-month aneurysm occlusion rate and complication profile of FRED are similar to other FDs.",d5zx48au

The standard preventive treatment in these patients is usually acetylsalicylic acid. AIM The Randomized, double-blind, Evaluation in secondary Stroke Prevention comparing the EfficaCy and safety of the oral Thrombin inhibitor dabigatran etexilate vs. acetylsalicylic acid in patients with Embolic Stroke of Undetermined Source (RE-SPECT ESUS) is designed to determine whether the oral thrombin inhibitor dabigatran, taken within three-months after embolic stroke of undetermined source, is superior to acetylsalicylic acid for prevention of recurrent stroke and to characterize the safety of dabigatran in this setting. DESIGN Prospective, randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial in approximately 6000 patients and 550 centers with embolic stroke of undetermined source. Subjects are randomized to dabigatran or acetylsalicylic acid and treated for an expected minimum of six-months and up to approximately three-years. It is an event-driven trial aiming for 353 adjudicated primary outcome events. STUDY OUTCOMES The primary efficacy outcome is time to first recurrent stroke (ischemic, hemorrhagic, or unspecified). Key secondary outcomes are time to first ischemic stroke and time to first occurrence in the composite outcome of nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular death. The primary safety outcome is major hemorrhage, including symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. DISCUSSION Acetylsalicylic acid is the most common antithrombotic given to patients with embolic strokes of undetermined source to reduce recurrence risk.

Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and venography were performed over the iliofemoral segments before and after treatment. Cross-sectional vessel and lumen diameters were measured from the IVUS scans and the post-procedure anteroposterior and lateral venograms at 3 points (proximal, mid-section, and distal) along each iliofemoral vein by 2 independent observers blinded to the treatment method. Volumes of the recanalized segments were calculated and compared to volumes of the original venous segments to assess clot lysis with each PMT device. IVUS scans and venograms were also compared for their ability to identify residual lesions or clot in need of treatment. Repeatability between and among observers was analyzed using the Bland and Altman method. RESULTS All procedures were successfully completed; there were only 2 minor bleeding complications. The mean volume of the recanalized segment was 2255+/-66 mm(3) by IVUS, representing 80% lysis of the clot compared to what was perceived as >90% lysis with venography (p<0.05). IVUS was able to delineate significant residual thrombus, stenosis, or May-Thurner anatomy requiring ancillary interventions in 100% of patients versus 48% (16/33) on the venograms (p<0.01). Quantitative assessments of the diameters of the involved venous segments from the venograms and IVUS were consistent between and among observers. Comparing the similar patient subgroups, AngioJet resulted in greater clot lysis (88%) versus the Trellis device (72%; p<0.01), corresponding to recanalized venous segment volumes of 2486+/-74 and 2025+/-57 mm(3) and total venous segment volumes of 2826+/-84 and 2813+/-79 mm(3), respectively.

Our goal was to study the evolution of flow-diverter endothelialization and thrombus organization at different time points after flow-diverter treatment in giant fusiform aneurysms to better understand reasons for flow-diverter thrombosis and delayed aneurysm ruptures. MATERIALS AND METHODS Two giant anterior and 2 posterior circulation aneurysms, all of which had partially thrombosed before treatment, were studied. An unruptured, untreated posterior circulation aneurysm was used as a control. Each specimen was removed at 7 days or at 6, 9, or 13 months after flow-diverter treatment. The 3 patients who survived longer than 7 days were followed up by angiography and MR imaging. Formaldehyde-fixed paraffin-embedded sections were stained by using H&E, Van Gieson elastic, CD34, h-Caldesmon, and Picrosirius stains and studied by light microscopy. RESULTS According to angiography, aneurysms were found to be obliterated partially at 6 and 9 months and completely at 13 months. MR imaging revealed that mass effect remained unchanged in each case. Sections of the flow diverter within the normal parent artery were covered by an endothelialized fibrous layer as early as 6 months, but there was no tissue coverage or endothelialization seen even at 13 months inside the aneurysm itself. Each treated aneurysm had a thin wall with complete lack of smooth muscle cells. No signs of thrombus organization were found at any of the time points studied. CONCLUSIONS Endothelialization of the flow diverter in giant fusiform aneurysms may not occur and thrombus organization may not be initiated inside these aneurysms for as long as 1 year, which explains delayed flow-diverter thrombosis and the possibility of delayed ruptures.",o75j9nhm

The significance of delayed posttreatment residual flow occurring months after FD treatment is unknown. CASE DESCRIPTION A 76-year-old woman with a large intracranial aneurysm measuring 23.0 × 18.1 mm in the cavernous segment of the right internal carotid artery was treated with placement of a single FD (Pipeline Embolization Device, Covidien, Irvine, California, USA). Postprocedure digital subtraction angiography (DSA) demonstrated flow stagnation inside the aneurysm dome. The patient was discharged 9 days post procedure without new neurologic deficits. A 6-month follow-up DSA demonstrated delayed posttreatment residual flow into the aneurysm sac. Although she was scheduled for additional FD placement because of concern for aneurysmal rupture, the operation was not conducted due to an interim motor vehicle accident. Oral treatment with aspirin (100 mg/day) and clopidogrel (75 mg/day) was continued during her recovery. DSA performed 12 months post procedure showed that the aneurysm had completely thrombosed. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that delayed post-treatment residual flow into an aneurysm may form part of the normal clinical course post FD placement and may not preclude eventual thrombosis of the aneurysm. Larger studies are needed to determine whether more frequent follow-up DSAs after FD placement are necessary and whether all patients exhibiting delayed post-treatment residual flow into an aneurysm require additional FD placement or if watchful waiting is a more suitable course.",v2n9yedv

Treatment should be considered for symptomatic patients or for those at risk for complications, especially retroperitoneal bleeding which is correlated to tumor size, grade of the angiogenic component and to the presence of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). This study reports our single-center experience with the use of selective arterial embolization (SAE) in the management of symptomatic and asymptomatic renal AMLs. METHODS In this retrospective mono-centric study, all demographic and imaging data, medical records, angiographic features, outpatient charts and follow-up visits of patients who underwent prophylactic or emergency SAE for AMLs between January 2005 and July 2016 were reviewed. Tumor size and treatment outcomes were assessed at baseline and after the procedure during follow-up. Computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or ultrasonography was used to evaluate AML shrinkage. Renal function was measured pre- and post-procedure. RESULTS Twenty-three patients (18 females, 5 males; median age, 45 years; range, 19-85 years) who underwent SAE either to treat bleeding AML (n=6) or as a prophylactic treatment (n=17) were included. Overall, 34 AMLs were embolized. TSC status was confirmed for 6 patients. Immediate technical success rate was 96% and 4 patients benefitted from an additional procedure. Major complications occurred in 3 patients and minor post-embolization syndrome (PES) in 14 patients. The mean AML size reduction rate was 26.2% after a mean follow-up was 20.5 months (range, 0.5-56 months), and only non-TSC status was significantly associated with better shrinkage of tumor (P=0.022). Intralesional aneurysms were significantly more frequent in patients with hemorrhagic presentation (P=0.008). There was no change in mean creatinine level after SAE. CONCLUSIONS SAE is a safe and effective technique to manage renal AMLs as a preventive treatment as well as in emergency setting, with significant reduction in tumor size during follow-up. A multidisciplinary approach remains fundamental, especially for TSC patients. In addition to size, the presence of intralesional aneurysms should be considered in any prophylactic treatment decision.",43qbks58

A new type of bioactive coil, the polyglycolic/polylactic acid-covered platinum microfilaments Nexus coil (ev3/Covidien, Irvine, CA, USA), has been proposed. The objective is to evaluate the safety and short-term and mid-term efficacy of Nexus coils in the endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms. METHODS The ENDECOR (European Nexus Detachable Coil Registry) is the first prospective, consecutive, multicenter non-randomized registry. After providing informed consent, 390 patients (238 women and 152 men; mean age, 51.6 years) with 404 ruptured or unruptured aneurysms were enrolled at 34 centers. Treatment was performed with at least 75 % of coil length as Nexus coils. Clinical and technical complications were systematically reported. An independent core laboratory evaluated angiographic results by using the Raymond Grading Scale. RESULTS Complete occlusion was seen in 181 aneurysms (48 %); neck remnant in 86 aneurysms (22 %) and aneurysm remnant in 111 aneurysms (30 %). Technical and clinical complications related to the procedure occurred in 33 patients (8.5 %). At discharge, overall mortality and permanent-morbidity were 4.1 % (16/390) and 5.6 % (14/251), respectively. Angiographic mean follow-up of 13.3 months was obtained in 233 of 390 patients (64.4 %) harboring 247 aneurysms. Recanalization was observed in 44 aneurysms (17.7 %), and progressive thrombosis was observed in 53 aneurysms (21.6 %). CONCLUSIONS Endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms with Nexus coils was associated with low morbidity and mortality rates. Efficacy of Nexus coils was comparable to published series of intracranial aneurysms treated with bare platinum coils, but their efficacy to prevent aneurysm recanalization was not demonstrated.",krzrboud

Treatment discontinuation rates in vitamin K antagonist (VKA)-treated patients are high but may be lower with non-VKA oral anticoagulant agents. OBJECTIVES The goal of this study was to describe and explore predictors of dabigatran etexilate persistence in patients with newly diagnosed AF over 2 years of follow-up. METHODS Consecutive patients newly diagnosed with AF and ≥1 stroke risk factor were followed up for 2 years. Dabigatran nonpersistence was defined as discontinuation of dabigatran for >30 days. A multivariable Cox regression model included region as well as patient clinical and sociodemographic characteristics to explore predictors of nonpersistence. RESULTS Eligible patients (N = 2,932) took ≥1 dabigatran dose; their mean age was 70.3 ± 10.2 years, and 55.3% were male. The 2-year probability of dabigatran persistence was 69.2%. Approximately 7% switched to a factor Xa inhibitor and 6% to a VKA. Approximately one-third of dabigatran discontinuations were primarily due to serious or nonserious adverse events. Patients from North America had the highest discontinuation risk, and Latin America had the lowest. Minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic AF and permanent AF were associated with a lower risk for dabigatran nonpersistence. Previous proton pump inhibitor use was associated with a higher risk for dabigatran nonpersistence. CONCLUSIONS Probability of treatment persistence with dabigatran after 2 years was approximately 70%. Nearly one-half of the patients who stopped dabigatran switched to another oral anticoagulant agent. Patients from North America, and those with paroxysmal, persistent, or symptomatic AF, may be at a higher risk for discontinuing dabigatran.",9tb9564p

The current standard in these patients is acetylsalicylic acid, despite high prevalence of yet undetected paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Aim The ATTICUS randomized trial is designed to determine whether the factor Xa inhibitor apixaban administered within 7 days after embolic stroke of undetermined source, is superior to acetylsalicylic acid for prevention of new ischemic lesions documented by brain magnetic resonance imaging within 12 months after index stroke. Design Prospective, randomized, blinded, parallel-group, open-label, German multicenter phase III trial in approximately 500 patients with embolic stroke of undetermined source. A key inclusion criterion is the presence or the planned implantation of an insertable cardiac monitor. Patients are 1:1 randomized to apixaban or acetylsalicylic acid and treated for a 12-month period. It is an event-driven trial aiming for core-lab adjudicated primary outcome events. Study outcomes The primary outcome is the occurrence of at least one new ischemic lesion identified by axial T2-weighted FLAIR magnetic resonance imaging and/or axial DWI magnetic resonance imaging at 12 months when compared with the baseline magnetic resonance imaging. Key secondary outcomes are the combination of recurrent ischemic strokes, hemorrhagic strokes, systemic embolism; combination of MACE including recurrent stroke, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular death and combination of major and clinically relevant non-major bleeding defined according to ISTH, and change of cognitive function and quality of life (EQ-5D, Stroke Impact Scale). Discussion Embolic stroke of undetermined source is caused by embolic disease and associated with a high risk of recurrent ischemic strokes and clinically silent cerebral ischemic lesions. ATTICUS will investigate the impact of atrial fibrillation detected by insertable cardiac monitor and the effects of early anticoagulation with apixaban compared with antiplatelet therapy with acetylsalicylic acid on the incidence of new ischemic lesion after embolic stroke of undetermined source.",6taai8h0

METHODS A prospective, multicentre series was conducted at 11 interventional centres in Europe to evaluate embolisation of bAVMs with the new liquid embolic agent. Technical conditions, complications, clinical outcome and anatomical results were independently analysed. RESULTS From December 2005 to December 2008, 117 patients (72 male; 45 female, aged 18-75 years) were included. Clinical presentation was mostly haemorrhage (34.2 %) and seizures (28.2 %). Most AVMs were located in the brain hemispheres (85.5 %). AVMs were <3 cm in 52.1 % of patients and ≥ 3 cm in 47.9 %. Morbidity was observed in 6/117 patients (5.1 %), related to haemorrhagic events in 2 cases and non-haemorrhagic complications in 4 cases. Five patients (4.3 %) died in relation to the treatment (bleeding in 4 patients and extensive venous thrombosis in 1).

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy and safety of retrievable vena cava filters plus anticoagulation vs anticoagulation alone for preventing pulmonary embolism recurrence in patients presenting with acute pulmonary embolism and a high risk of recurrence. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized, open-label, blinded end point trial (PREPIC2) with 6-month follow-up conducted from August 2006 to January 2013. Hospitalized patients with acute, symptomatic pulmonary embolism associated with lower-limb vein thrombosis and at least 1 criterion for severity were assigned to retrievable inferior vena cava filter implantation plus anticoagulation (filter group; n = 200) or anticoagulation alone with no filter implantation (control group; n = 199). Initial hospitalization with ambulatory follow-up occurred in 17 French centers. INTERVENTIONS Full-dose anticoagulation for at least 6 months in all patients. Insertion of a retrievable inferior vena cava filter in patients randomized to the filter group. Filter retrieval was planned at 3 months from placement. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary efficacy outcome was symptomatic recurrent pulmonary embolism at 3 months. Secondary outcomes were recurrent pulmonary embolism at 6 months, symptomatic deep vein thrombosis, major bleeding, death at 3 and 6 months, and filter complications. RESULTS In the filter group, the filter was successfully inserted in 193 patients and was retrieved as planned in 153 of the 164 patients in whom retrieval was attempted. By 3 months, recurrent pulmonary embolism had occurred in 6 patients (3.0%; all fatal) in the filter group and in 3 patients (1.5%; 2 fatal) in the control group (relative risk with filter, 2.00 [95% CI, 0.51-7.89]; P = .50). Results were similar at 6 months. No difference was observed between the 2 groups regarding the other outcomes. Filter thrombosis occurred in 3 patients. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among hospitalized patients with severe acute pulmonary embolism, the use of a retrievable inferior vena cava filter plus anticoagulation compared with anticoagulation alone did not reduce the risk of symptomatic recurrent pulmonary embolism at 3 months. These findings do not support the use of this type of filter in patients who can be treated with anticoagulation. TRIAL REGISTRATION clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00457158.",otd3j630

Patients were randomized to standard care or standard care + noradrenaline infusion. Low-dose noradrenaline improved intraoperative platelet aggregation and clot formation. Noradrenaline may be considered to improve intraoperative hemostasis during cardiac surgery. SUMMARY: Background New approaches to prevent bleeding complications during cardiac surgery are needed. Objective To investigate if noradrenaline (NA) enhances platelet aggregation in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Patients/Methods Twenty-four patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) were included in a prospective parallel-group randomized study. All patients but one were treated with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). In the treatment group (n = 12), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) was maintained at pre-induction levels by NA infusion. In the control group (n = 12), NA was administered only if MAP decreased below 60 mmHg. Platelet aggregation (impedance aggregometry with ADP, arachidonic acid [AA] and thrombin-receptor activating peptide [TRAP] as initiators) and clot formation (clotting time, clot formation time and maximum clot firmness by EXTEM, INTEM and FIBTEM tests with thromboelastometry) were assessed before and 50 min after anesthesia induction (before cardiopulmonary bypass was initiated). Results All patients in the treatment group received NA (median dose after 50 min 0.09 (range 0-0.26) μg kg-1 min-1 ). Four patients in the control group also received NA (0.03-0.12 μg kg-1 min-1 ). There were differences between the treatment group and the control group in ADP- and AA-induced aggregation changes (ADP, +16 [25th-75th percentiles, 5-26] vs. -7 [-19 to -1] U; AA, +12 [-4 to 16] vs. -9 [-13 to 1] U). INTEM maximum clot firmness increased in the treatment group but not in the control group. Conclusion Infusion of clinically relevant doses of NA enhanced platelet aggregation and clot firmness in ASA-treated CABG patients. NA infusion is hence a potential new method to acutely improve platelet reactivity in patients on antiplatelet therapy undergoing surgery.",3ozef29x

Cardiovascular interventions,"Proton Pump Inhibitors, Platelet Reactivity, and Cardiovascular Outcomes After Drug-Eluting Stents in Clopidogrel-Treated Patients: The ADAPT-DES Study."," Certain proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) interfere with clopidogrel metabolism, potentially attenuating P2Y12 receptor inhibition. Previous observational and randomized trials report conflicting results regarding the clinical significance of this pharmacological interaction. We examined the interaction between concomitant administration of PPI and clopidogrel on platelet reactivity and clinical outcomes in the large-scale, prospective Assessment of Dual AntiPlatelet Therapy With Drug-Eluting Stents study. METHODS AND RESULTS On-treatment P2Y12 platelet reactivity testing was performed using the VerifyNow assay after clopidogrel loading and successful drug-eluting stent implantation at 11 sites in the United States and Germany. PPIs were prescribed at the discretion of treating physicians; patients were followed for 2 years. High platelet reactivity was defined as P2Y12 reactivity units >208. Of 8582 enrolled patients, 2697 (31.4%) were taking a PPI at the time of coronary intervention. After adjustment for differences in baseline characteristics, PPI use was independently associated with high platelet reactivity (odds ratio, 1.38: 95% confidence interval, 1.25-1.52, P=0.0001). A total of 2162 (25.2%) patients were prescribed a PPI at hospital discharge. In a propensity-adjusted multivariable analysis, discharge PPI use was independently associated with increased risk for postdischarge major adverse cardiac events (cardiac death, myocardial infarction, or ischemia-driven target lesion revascularization) at 2-year follow-up (hazard ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.42, P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS In patients treated with clopidogrel after successful drug-eluting stents implantation, the concomitant administration of PPI was associated with high platelet reactivity and a greater rate of adverse outcomes during long-term follow-up. Additional studies are warranted to determine the risk-benefit ratio of PPIs in patients with drug-eluting stents treated with clopidogrel.

MATERIALS AND METHODS 39 patients (17 women and 22 men) with a total of 125 liver metastases were treated with percutaneous or intraoperative CEUS-guided MW ablation. The primary tumor was colorectal cancer (n = 31), breast cancer (n = 6), carcinoid tumor (n = 1), and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) (n = 1). The median number of metastases ablated in the 45 treatment sessions was 2 (range 1 - 11). The median size (maximum diameter) of the 125 metastases was 1.5 cm (range, 0.6 - 4.0 cm). Nineteen (15 %) of the 125 metastases were bigger than 2 cm. Metastases smaller than 2 cm were treated with a single needle, metastases bigger than 2 cm were treated with 2 or 3 parallel needles. RESULTS The 45 MW ablation sessions were performed percutaneously (n = 30), during laparotomy (n = 3), or during laparotomy combined with liver resection (n = 12). The 39 patients were followed up for at least 4 months with a median duration of 11 months (range, 4 - 20 months). The technical success rate was 100 %. The clinical effectiveness was 100 % with complete coverage of the metastasis by the avascular coagulation zone evaluated on immediate post-ablation CEUS. Local tumor progression (local recurrence) was seen in 12 (9.6 %) of the 125 treated metastases, and affected 10 (26 %) of the 39 patients. One major complication was observed in the form of a liver abscess that easily resolved after percutaneous drainage. Four minor complications were observed: Three cases of pain located at the puncture site and one case of ascites. CEUS was valuable in all phases of ablation including pre-ablation staging and procedure planning, placement of MW needles in the tumor, immediate post-ablation control of coagulation size, and finally in the long term follow-up regime. CONCLUSION CEUS-guided MW ablation of liver metastases is an efficient and safe ablation technique with several advantages compared to other ablation modalities.",253t8e5p
