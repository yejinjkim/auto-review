to public health. There is no specific medicine available for treating the disease. Luckily, traditional Chinese medicine has played a positive role in the fighting against COVID-19. In this paper, We collected and sorted the prescriptions of modern Chinese medicine for COVID-19 released by national government, different provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities, as well as online databases, such as CNKI, WanFang medical network, and VIP database. These prescriptions were combined with the inheritance of traditional Chinese medicine auxiliary V2.5, and the complex system entropy clustering method was used to determine the association rules and frequency of single drug and drug combination in the prescription. In the end, 96 effective prescriptions were included. Among them, the four properties were mainly concentrated in temperature, cold and level, the five tastes were mainly concentrated in bitter, hot and sweet, and the meridians were mainly concentrated in lung, stomach and spleen. The high-frequency drugs were Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma, Armeniacae Semen Amarum, Gypsum Fibrosum, etc., and the high-frequency combinations are Gypsum Fibrosum-Armeniacae Semen Amarum, Gypsum Fibrosum-Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma, Armeniacae Semen Amarum-Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma, the core combinations are Lepidii Semen-Armeniacae Semen Amarum-Gypsum Fibrosum, Pogostemonis Herba-Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens-Magnoliae Officinalis Cortex, Ophiopogonis Radix-Armeniacae Semen Amarum-Scutellariae Radix and so on. Form new prescriptions Lepidii Semen, Armeniacae Semen Amarum, Gypsum Fibrosum, Pogostemonis Herba, Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens, Magnoliae Officinalis Cortex. Ophiopogonis Radix, Armeniacae Semen Amarum, Scutellariae Radix, Schisandrae Sphenantherae Fructus, Panacis Quinquefolii Radix. From the medicinal properties to high-frequency drugs and new prescriptions, it could be seen that the overall treatment of COVID-19 by traditional Chinese medicine was to strengthen body resistance, eliminate pathogenic factors, and give attention to Qi and Yin.", " Fertility in dairy cows depends on ovarian cyclicity and on uterine involution. Ovarian cyclicity and uterine involution are delayed when there is uterine dysbiosis (overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria). Fertility in dairy cows may involve a mechanism through which the uterine microbiota affects ovarian cyclicity as well as the transcriptome of the endometrium within the involuting uterus. The hypothesis was that the transcriptome of the endometrium in postpartum cows would be associated with the cyclicity status of the cow as well as the microbiota during uterine involution. The endometrium of first lactation dairy cows was sampled at 1, 5, and 9 weeks postpartum. All cows were allowed to return to cyclicity without intervention until week 5 and treated with an ovulation synchronization protocol so that sampling at week 9 was on day 13 of the estrous cycle. The endometrial microbiota was measured by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and principal component analysis. The endometrial transcriptome was measured by mRNA sequencing, differential gene expression analysis, and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. RESULTS The endometrial microbiota changed from week 1 to week 5 but the week 5 and week 9 microbiota were similar. The endometrial transcriptome differed for cows that were either cycling or not cycling at week 5 and cyclicity status depended in part on the endometrial microbiota. Compared with cows cycling at week 5, there were large changes in the transcriptome of cows that progressed from non-cycling at week 5 to cycling at week 9. There was evidence for concurrent and longer-term associations between the endometrial microbiota and transcriptome. The week 1 endometrial microbiota had the greatest effect on the subsequent endometrial transcriptome and this effect was greatest at week 5 and diminished by week 9. CONCLUSIONS The cumulative response of the endometrial transcriptome to the microbiota represented the combination of past microbial exposure and current microbial exposure. The endometrial transcriptome in postpartum cows, therefore, depended on the immediate and longer-term effects of the uterine microbiota that acted directly on the uterus. There may also be an indirect mechanism through which the microbiome affects the transcriptome through the restoration of ovarian cyclicity postpartum.", "Introduction Transoral laser microsurgery (TLM) has established itself as an effective option in the management of malignant tumors of the glottis, supraglottis, and hypopharynx. Nonetheless, TLM is not a harmless technique. Complications such as bleeding, dyspnea, or ignition of the air may appear in this type of surgery. Objective The aim of this study is to describe the complications that occurred in a group of patients treated for glottic and supraglottic carcinomas in all stages by TLM. Methods This study is a retrospective analysis of patients diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the glottis and supraglottis for all stages (T1, T2, T3, T4), N -/ + , M -/+ treated with TLM between January 2009 and March 2012 in a tertiary hospital. Results Ninety-eight patients met the inclusion criteria, which had undergone a total of 131 interventions. Ninety-four (95.9%) patients were male and 4 (4.1%) were female. The mean age was 64.2 years (\u00b1 10.7 years = min 45; max 88). The presence of intraoperative complications was low, affecting only 2% of patients. Immediate postoperative complications occurred in 6.1%, whereas delayed complications affected 13.2% of patients, without any of them being fatal. Conclusion TLM has shown good oncologic results and low complication rate compared with traditional open surgery during intervention, in the immediate and delayed postoperative period and in the long-term with respect to radiotherapy.", " To ensure the safety and efficacy of the increasing number of transvenous lead extractions (TLEs), it is necessary to adequately assess the procedure-related risk. METHODS We analyzed potential clinical and procedural risk factors associated with 2049 TLE procedures. The TLEs were performed between 2006 and 2016 using only simple tools for lead extraction. Logistic regression analysis was used to develop a risk prediction scoring system for TLEs. RESULTS Multivariate analysis showed that the sum of lead dwell times, anemia, female gender, the number of procedures preceding TLE, and removal of leads implanted in patients under the age of 30 had a significant influence on the occurrence of major complications during a TLE. This information served as a basis for developing a predictive SAFeTY TLE score, where: S = sum of lead dwell times, A = anemia, Fe = female, T = treatment (previous procedures), Y = young patients, and TLE = transvenous lead extraction. In order to facilitate the use of the SAFeTY TLE Score, a simple calculator was constructed. CONCLUSION The SAFeTY TLE score is easy to calculate and predicts the potential occurrence of procedure-related major complications. High-risk patients (scoring more than 10 on the SAFeTY TLE scale) must be treated at high-volume centers with surgical backup.", "SUMMARYPatients undergoing solid-organ transplantation (SOT) or allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) are at increased risk for infectious complications. Community-acquired respiratory viruses (CARVs) pose a particular challenge due to the frequent exposure pre-, peri-, and posttransplantation. Although influenza A and B viruses have a top priority regarding prevention and treatment, recent molecular diagnostic tests detecting an array of other CARVs in real time have dramatically expanded our knowledge about the epidemiology, diversity, and impact of CARV infections in the general population and in allogeneic HCT and SOT patients. These data have demonstrated that non-influenza CARVs independently contribute to morbidity and mortality of transplant patients. However, effective vaccination and antiviral treatment is only emerging for non-influenza CARVs, placing emphasis on infection control and supportive measures. Here, we review the current knowledge about CARVs in SOT and allogeneic HCT patients to better define the magnitude of this unmet clinical need and to discuss some of the lessons learned from human influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenzavirus, rhinovirus, coronavirus, adenovirus, and bocavirus regarding diagnosis, prevention, and treatment.", "Every year, approximately 62,000 people with stroke and transient ischemic attack are treated in Canadian hospitals. The 2014 update of the Canadian Secondary Prevention of Stroke guideline is a comprehensive summary of current evidence-based recommendations for clinicians in a range of settings, who provide care to patients following stroke. Notable changes in this 5th edition include an emphasis on treating the highest risk patients who present within 48 h of symptom onset with transient or persistent motor or speech symptoms, who need to be transported to the closest emergency department with capacity for advanced stroke care; a recommendation for brain and vascular imaging (of the intra- and extracranial vessels) to be completed urgently using computed tomography/computed tomography angiography; prolonged cardiac monitoring for patients with suspective cardioembolic stroke but without evidence for atrial fibrillation on electrocardiogram or holter monitoring; and de-emphasizing the need for routine echocardiogram. The Canadian Stroke Best Practice Recommendations include a range of supporting materials such as implementation resources to facilitate the adoption of evidence to practice, and related performance measures to enable monitoring of uptake and effectiveness of the recommendations using a standardized approach. The guidelines further emphasize the need for a systems approach to stroke care, involving an interprofessional team, with access to specialists regardless of patient location, and the need to overcome geographical barriers to ensure equity in access within a universal health-care system.", "Patients affected by severe coronavirus induced disease-2019 (Covid-19) often experience hypoxemia due to alveolar involvement and endothelial dysfunction, which leads to the formation of micro thrombi in the pulmonary capillary vessels. Both hypoxemia and a prothrombotic diathesis have been associated with more severe disease and increased risk of death. To date, specific indications to treat this condition are lacking. This was a single center, investigator initiated, compassionate use, proof of concept, case control, phase IIb study (NCT04368377) conducted in the Intermediate Respiratory Care Unit of L. Sacco University Hospital in Milano, Italy. Our objective was to explore the effects of the administration of anti-platelet therapy on arterial oxygenation and clinical outcomes in patients with severe Covid-19 with hypercoagulability. We enrolled five consecutive patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, severe respiratory failure requiring helmet continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and a pro-thrombotic state identified as a D-dimer > 3 times the upper limit of normal. Five patients matched for age, D-dimer value and SOFA score formed the control group. Beyond standard of care, treated patients received 25 \u00b5g/Kg/body weight tirofiban as bolus infusion, followed by a continuous infusion of 0.15 \u00b5g/Kg/body weight per minute for 48 hours. Before tirofiban, patients received acetylsalicylic acid 250 mg infusion and oral clopidogrel 300 mg; both were continued at a dose of 75 mg daily for 30 days. Fondaparinux2.5 mg/day sub-cutaneous was given for the duration of the hospital stay. All controls were receiving prophylactic or therapeutic dose heparin, according to local standard operating procedures. Treated patients consistently experienced a mean (SD) reduction in A-a O2 gradient of -32.6 mmHg (61.9, P = 0.154), -52.4 mmHg (59.4, P = 0.016) and -151.1 mmHg (56.6, P = 0.011; P = 0.047 vs. controls) at 24, 48 hours and 7 days after treatment. PaO2/FiO2 ratio increased by 52 mmHg (50, P = 0.172), 64 mmHg (47, P = 0.040) and 112 mmHg (51, P = 0.036) after 24, 48 hours and 7 days, respectively. All patients but one were successfully weaned from CPAP after 3 days. This was not true for the control group. No major adverse events were observed. Antiplatelet therapy might be effective in improving the ventilation/perfusion ratio in Covid-19 patients with severe respiratory failure. The effects might be sustained by the prevention and interference on forming clots in lung capillary vessels and by modulating megakaryocytes\u2019 function and platelet adhesion. Randomized clinical trials are urgently needed to confirm these results.", "Pneumonia is a serious problem worldwide. We recently demonstrated that innate defense mechanisms of the lung are highly inducible against pneumococcal pneumonia. To determine the breadth of protection conferred by stimulation of lung mucosal innate immunity, and to identify cells and signaling pathways activated by this treatment, mice were treated with an aerosolized bacterial lysate, then challenged with lethal doses of bacterial and fungal pathogens. Mice were highly protected against a broad array of Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and class A bioterror bacterial pathogens, and the fungal pathogen, Aspergillus fumigatus. Protection was associated with rapid pathogen killing within the lungs, and this effect was recapitulated in vitro using a respiratory epithelial cell line. Gene expression analysis of lung tissue showed marked activation of NF-kappaB, type I and II IFN, and antifungal Card9-Bcl10-Malt1 pathways. Cytokines were the most strongly induced genes, but the inflammatory cytokines TNF and IL-6 were not required for protection. Lung-expressed antimicrobial peptides were also highly up-regulated. Taken together, stimulated innate resistance appears to occur through the activation of multiple host defense signaling pathways in lung epithelial cells, inducing rapid pathogen killing, and conferring broad protection against virulent bacterial and fungal pathogens. Augmentation of innate antimicrobial defenses of the lungs might have therapeutic value for protection of patients with neutropenia or impaired adaptive immunity against opportunistic pneumonia, and for defense of immunocompetent subjects against a bioterror threat or epidemic respiratory infection.", "Significant advances have been made in allogeneic transplantation for both adults and pediatric transplant recipients over the past 20 years, corresponding with dramatic declines in treatment-related mortality (TRM). The cumulative incidence of TRM at 1 year following unrelated donor transplants has decreased from 40 to 15 % between 1987 and 2006 for children with acute leukemia, the primary indication for transplant in the pediatric population (MacMillan et al., Biol Blood Marrow Transpl 14(9 Suppl):16\u201322, 2008). Improvements in conditioning regimen, supportive care, and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) testing have all been associated with incremental improvements in survival during this period. In particular, the management of both infectious and noninfectious organ complications has changed dramatically, with improved sensitivity for diagnostic testing for pathogens and tremendous improvements in our understanding of organ complications. Two organ complications in particular, pulmonary and hepatic, have been a major focus of investigation over the past several decades. The introduction of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors for the management of acute, noninfectious lung injury and the introduction of an endothelial stabilizing agent (defibrotide) for the management of hepatic veno-occlusive disease have been major advances in the past decade.", "Viruses are leading causes of severe acute lower respiratory infections (LRIs). These infections evoke incomplete immunity, as individuals can be repeatedly reinfected throughout life. We report that acute viral LRI causes rapid pulmonary CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte (TCD8) functional impairment via programmed death-1/programmed death ligand-1 (PD-1/PD-L1) signaling, a pathway previously associated with prolonged antigenic stimulation during chronic infections and cancer. PD-1-mediated TCD8 impairment occurred acutely in mice following infection with human metapneumovirus or influenza virus. Viral antigen was sufficient for PD-1 upregulation, but induction of PD-L1 was required for impairment. During secondary viral infection or epitope-only challenge, memory TCD8 rapidly reexpressed PD-1 and exhibited severe functional impairment. Inhibition of PD-1 signaling using monoclonal antibody blockade prevented TCD8 impairment, reduced viral titers during primary infection, and enhanced protection of immunized mice against challenge infection. Additionally, PD-1 and PD-L1 were upregulated in the lungs of patients with 2009 H1N1 influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, or parainfluenza virus infection. These results indicate that PD-1 mediates TCD8 functional impairment during acute viral infection and may contribute to recurrent viral LRIs. Therefore, the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway may represent a therapeutic target in the treatment of respiratory viruses.", "The guidewire (GW) is probably the most important tool for the endovascular treatment of arterial obstructions. In fact, the treatment of a lesion is only possible when the GW is passed beyond the target lesion. Lower limb percutaneous arterial revascularisation can be achieved using a variety of GWs which may differ in calibre, body, tip or coating. As the choice of an appropriate GW is critical for the success of a lower limb artery angioplasty, knowledge of the properties and performances of different GWs should be well known in order to tailor the choice of the device to the lesion characteristics and location, as well as to the intended revascularisation strategy. The aim of the present paper is to describe the constructive characteristics of GWs for lower limb arterial revascularisation, and to evaluate groups of GWs for each segment of the lower limb arterial vasculature.", " An Amyand's hernia is defined by the presence of a vermiform appendix within an inguinal hernia sac. Most of these cases are not diagnosed preoperatively and the surgical approach is dependent on the type present and associated intraoperative findings. We present a case of a preoperatively diagnosed Amyand's hernia in a man who underwent treatment by simultaneous laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal repair and laparoscopic appendectomy. CASE PRESENTATION We encountered the case of a 76-year-old Japanese man with a right inguinal pain. Ultrasound and computed tomography confirmed his vermiform appendix herniated into the right inguinal canal. We managed a simultaneous laparoscopic total extraperitoneal inguinal hernia repair with mesh and laparoscopic appendectomy. He was discharged without any postoperative morbidity. CONCLUSIONS We recommend laparoscopic appendectomy and totally extraperitoneal hernia repair with mesh after laparoscopic reduction for Amyand's hernia.", "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has emerged as one of the greatest challenges faced by humankind in the recent past. People with diabetes and related comorbidities are at increased risk of its complications and of COVID-19-related death. Older age, multi-morbidity, hyperglycaemia, cardiac injury and severe inflammatory response are predictors of poor outcome. The complex interplay between COVID-19, diabetes and the effects of related therapies is being explored. Most patients experience a mild illness with COVID-19, while people with diabetes are at increased risk of severe disease. Optimising glycaemic control and adopting measures to prevent disease spread are critical aspects. The management of mild disease is supportive, while very many immunomodulatory and antiviral therapies are being investigated for the treatment of severe disease. Several of these agents have specific considerations for use in people with diabetes. Since mass population lockdowns are considered a key step in controlling disease spread, it follows that, in addition to the direct vulnerability to severe COVID-19, people with diabetes can be affected by limited access to healthcare, insulin, other medications and blood glucose monitoring equipment. Measures to prevent disease spread at the individual and community level are the key to mitigating the rapidly escalating pandemic, while agents for chemoprophylaxis and vaccines are being explored. People with diabetes should be recognised as a vulnerable group for complicated disease and are at risk during times of disturbed social systems. Strategies are needed to safeguard the health of patients with diabetes during the pandemic. This review summarises the current knowledge and perceived challenges for prevention and management of COVID-19 in people with diabetes.", "OBJECTIVE To describe the treatment of posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) aneurysms with the Low-profile Visualized Intraluminal Support Device (LVIS Jr) stent. MATERIALS AND METHODS The databases of three institutions were retrospectively reviewed. Patients who underwent endovascular treatment of PICA aneurysms using a reconstructive technique where the LVIS Jr stent was totally or partially deployed into the PICA were included in the analysis. Clinical presentation, aneurysm and PICA sizes, procedural complications, and clinical and angiographic follow-up information was recorded and analyzed. RESULTS Seven patients who underwent endovascular treatment of PICA aneurysms with an LVIS Jr stent were identified. Four aneurysms were treated in the acute phase of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). There were no symptomatic complications. One patient had spasm distal to the stent as a result of mechanical straightening of the vessel. One patient was treated in the acute phase of SAH and required a gycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor after the stent was implanted. This patient needed to be re-treated to complete embolization. All patients had good clinical outcomes (Glasgow Outcome Scale 5). No in-stent stenosis or occlusion was seen on short-term angiographic follow-up and the aneurysms were occluded. CONCLUSIONS This small series suggests that the use of a reconstructive technique with the LVIS Jr stent for the treatment of PICA aneurysms is feasible, safe and effective in the short term.", "Human enterovirus 68 (EVD68) is a primary causative agent for respiratory illness worldwide. Until now, there has been no available medication for treating EVD68-related diseases. Rheum emodin, artemisinin, astragaloside, pseudolaric acid B, oridonin, and erianin are natural extracts from Chinese herbs that have traditionally been used for the treatment and prevention of epidemic diseases. Our results showed that pseudolaric acid B protected cells from EVD68-induced cytopathic effects and decreased viral production. However, the same effects were not observed with rheum emodin, astragaloside, or artemisinin. Pseudolaric acid B inhibited EVD68 production by manipulating the host cell cycle in G2/M phase. Further, either oridonin or erianin related G2/M arrest also inhibited viral production. Due to inducing G2/M phase arrest, pseudolaric acid B, oridonin, and erianin might be good candidates for inhibiting EVD68 production, and Chinese herbs with natural compounds inducing G2/M arrest should be considered for the treatment of EVD68-related diseases.", " Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) using stent-retrievers has been proven to be a safe and effective treatment in acute ischemic stroke (AIS), particularly in large vessel occlusion. Other than patient characteristics, time to recanalization is the most important factor linked to outcome. MT is usually performed in a dedicated angiography suite using a floor- and/or ceiling-mounted biplane angiographic system. Here we report our first experience of MT with a new combined CT and mobile C-arm X-ray device setup. METHODS Patients with AIS underwent stroke imaging (non-contrast enhanced CT, CT perfusion, and CT angiography) using a commercially available 64-slice CT scanner which was modified for combined use with a C-arm system. In patients with large vessel occlusion, MT was conducted without further patient transfer within the CT imaging suite using a mobile C-arm X-ray device equipped with a 30\u00d730 cm (12\u00d712 inch), 1.5\u00d71.5 k full-view flat detector which was positioned between the gantry and patient table. The safety and feasibility of this new system was assessed in preliminary patients. RESULTS Angiographic imaging quality of the mobile C-arm was feasible and satisfactory for diagnostic angiography and MT. Using this setup, time between stroke imaging and groin puncture (picture-to-puncture time) was reduced by up to 35 min (including time for preparation of the patient such as intubation). CONCLUSIONS MT using a combined CT/C-arm system is safe and feasible. The potential advantages, particularly time saving and ensuing improvement in patient outcome, need to be assessed in a larger study.", "The basic treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) over the past several decades has consisted of anticoagulation only, with inferior vena cava filtration for those who either failed or could not tolerate anticoagulation. Until recently no randomized trials had studied the efficacy of thrombolysis in DVT despite advances in techniques and technologies for endovascular clot removal. This article is a review of the current evidence on catheter-based therapies for patients with DVT. Technical considerations to improve outcome as well as optimal patient selection are discussed.", "Ebola virus (EBOV) is highly pathogenic, with a predisposition to cause outbreaks in human populations accompanied by significant mortality. Owing to the lack of approved therapies, screening programmes of potentially efficacious drugs have been undertaken. One of these studies has demonstrated the possible utility of chloroquine against EBOV using pseudotyped assays. In mouse models of EBOV disease there are conflicting reports of the therapeutic effects of chloroquine. There are currently no reports of its efficacy using the larger and more stringent guinea pig model of infection. In this study we have shown that replication of live EBOV is impaired by chloroquine in vitro. However, no protective effects were observed in vivo when EBOV-infected guinea pigs were treated with chloroquine. These results advocate that chloroquine should not be considered as a treatment strategy for EBOV.", "PURPOSE To report the results and complications of a single-center experience of above-the-knee angioplasty via transradial access (TRA). METHODS In a prospective study, 110 consecutive patients (88 men; mean age 72 years, range 37-90) referred for critical limb ischemia (26, 24%) or claudication were eligible for lower limb angioplasty via TRA (patients with TASC D lesions of the superficial femoral artery and below-the-knee lesions were excluded). RESULTS The majority of patients (84, 76%) were treated via a left TRA. A total of 170 lesions were addressed, of which 38 (22%) were occlusions; 113 stents were positioned in 82 patients. The overall technical success rate was 91%, with a 63% success rate in occlusions and a 98% success rate in stenoses; by location, the success rates were 91% in suprainguinal lesions and 90% in infrainguinal lesions. No hemorrhagic or local complications requiring surgery were observed. At 1-month follow-up, 101 patients had a downward shift of at least one category in the Rutherford classification of symptoms (clinical success rate 92%); 18 (16%) patients had occlusion of their access radial artery, but none had symptoms or discomfort. CONCLUSION The present study demonstrates that TRA is a safe and effective approach for lower extremity arterial revascularization, at least for interventionists with longstanding experience in TRA and in selected anatomical subsets.", " This systematic review examines healthcare costs associated with mental health conditions among cancer survivors in the United States. AREAS COVERED Ten published studies were identified. Studies varied substantially in terms of population, mental health conditions examined, data collection methods, and type of cost reported. Cancer survivors with mental health conditions incurred significantly higher total medical costs and costs of most service types compared to cancer survivors without a mental health condition. Additionally, the total healthcare expenditure related to mental health was higher among cancer survivors compared with people without history of cancer. EXPERT COMMENTARY Mental health conditions are associated with increased healthcare costs among cancer survivors. Future examination of other components of economic burden, including patient out-of-pocket costs, nonmedical costs, such as transportation, childcare, and productivity losses for patients and their caregivers, will be important. Additionally, evaluation of economic burden by cancer site, stage at diagnosis, duration of survivorship, and treatment(s) will increase understanding of the overall impact of mental health conditions on cancer survivors and on the healthcare system.", " AND PURPOSE In acute ischemic stroke patients, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)-Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography Score (ASPECTS) is correlated with infarct volume and is an independent factor of functional outcome. Patients with pretreatment DWI-ASPECTS \u22646 were excluded or under-represented in the recent randomized mechanical thrombectomy trials. Our aim was to assess the impact of reperfusion in pretreatment DWI-ASPECTS \u22646 patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy. METHODS We analyzed data collected between January 2012 and August 2015 in a bicentric prospective clinical registry of consecutive acute ischemic stroke patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy. Every patient with a documented internal carotid artery or middle cerebral artery occlusion with pretreatment DWI-ASPECTS \u22646 was eligible for this study. The primary end point was a favorable outcome defined by a modified Rankin Scale score \u22642 at 90 days. RESULTS Two hundred and eighteen patients with a DWI-ASPECTS \u22646 were included. Among them, 145 (66%) patients had successful reperfusion at the end of mechanical thrombectomy. Reperfused patients had an increased rate of favorable outcome (38.7% versus 17.4%; P=0.002) and a decreased rate of mortality at 3 months (22.5% versus 39.1%; P=0.013) compared with nonreperfused patients. The symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage rate was not different between the 2 groups (13.0% versus 14.1%; P=0.83). However, in patients with DWI-ASPECTS <5, favorable outcome was low (13.0% versus 9.5%; P=0.68) with a high mortality rate (45.7% versus 57.1%; P=0.38) with or without successful reperfusion. CONCLUSIONS Successful reperfusion is associated with reduced mortality and disability in patients with a pretreatment DWI-ASPECTS \u22646. Further data from randomized studies are needed, particularly in patients with DWI-ASPECTS <5.", " AND AIM Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for dysplastic Barrett's esophagus (BE) is highly effective. RFA failures are infrequent but can be a challenging cohort to manage. There are limited data on the feasibility of liquid nitrogen cryospray ablation for complete eradication of dysplasia (CE-D) and/or intestinal metaplasia (CE-IM) after RFA has failed to achieve CE-IM in patients with dysplastic BE. METHODS This is a retrospective review from two medical centers of prospectively maintained databases looking at patients that underwent liquid nitrogen cryospray ablation for refractory intestinal metaplasia post failed RFA. RESULTS Eighteen patients were identified that met inclusion criteria. Eleven patients had persistent dysplasia and IM following RFA and seven had persistent non-dysplastic IM. More than 80% of patients were male with long-segment BE (median length 8 cm). Seventy two percent of patients with dysplasia achieved CE-D after cryotherapy. Fifty percent (9/18) of all RFA failures achieved CE-IM with cryotherapy. In comparison, RFA has a CE-IM of 78% in a less challenging treatment na\u00efve cohort from a large-scale meta-analysis of 3802 patients. No adverse events occurred in our cohort. CONCLUSION Cryospray ablation is feasible and safe for achieving CE-D and CE-IM after RFA failure. The CE-D rates are high with cryotherapy in this population. CE-IM with cryotherapy is acceptable in this difficult-to-treat cohort when compared to CE-IM rates with RFA in dysplastic BE treatment na\u00efve patients (50% vs 78%).", "PURPOSE Laparoscopic ventral hernia repair (LVHR) is associated with shorter hospitalization and lower complication rates compared to open ventral hernia repair. We sought to determine if hernia-related factors, such as defect size and re-operative status correlate with postoperative complications, operative times and length of stay (LOS). METHODS The study is a retrospective review of 30-day perioperative outcomes following LVHR in 91 patients who underwent surgery at a single institution from August 2009 through June 2012. A single surgeon performed all procedures. RESULTS Indications for surgery were recurrent incisional hernia in 33 % of patients and primary incisional or ventral abdominal hernias in the rest. Coated polyester mesh with an average size of 348 cm(2) (\u00b1214; range 113-1,036) was used. Mean operative time was 132 min (\u00b166.1; range 53-412). The mean LOS was 4.0 days (\u00b13.5; range 1-22). Complications occurred in 13 patients for overall morbidity of 16.5 % and no mortality. There was one recurrence in 30 days (1.1 %). Patients who had a surgery >120 min or a LOS >1 day were statistically more likely to have multiple hernias, larger defect sizes (>40 cm(2)), larger mesh sizes (>300 cm(2)) or a history of recurrent hernia (P < 0.05). No other clinical or demographic variable evaluated in this study correlated with operative time or LOS. CONCLUSIONS LVHR is safe with a low incidence of perioperative complications. Patients with multiple, larger and recurrent hernias have longer operative times and LOS. This information can be used to guide preoperative planning for the patient, surgeon and treating institution.", "The spike (S) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is an important viral structural protein. Based on bioinformatics analysis, 10 antigenic peptides derived from the S protein sequence were selected and synthesized. The antigenicity and immunoreactivity of all the peptides were tested in vivo and in vitro. Four peptides (P6, P8, P9 and P10) which contain B cell epitopes of the S protein were identified, and P8 peptide was confirmed in vivo to have a potential in serological diagnosis. By using a syncytia formation model, we tested the neutralization ability of all 10 peptides and their corresponding antibodies. It is interesting to find that P8 and P9 peptides inhibited syncytia formation, suggesting that the P8 and P9 spanning regions may provide a good target for anti-SARS-CoV drug design. Our data suggest that we have identified peptides derived from the S protein of SARS-CoV, which are useful for SARS treatment and diagnosis.", " The COVID-19 outbreak is presenting the health system with new challenges, and there is a great need for knowledge about symptoms, clinical findings and course of illness in patients admitted to Norwegian hospitals with COVID-19. MATERIAL AND METHOD In this observational qualitative study, all patients admitted to a Norwegian local hospital (B\u00e6rum Hospital) with proven COVID-19 infection were included consecutively from the start of the outbreak. We present here patient characteristics, symptoms, clinical findings, experience of using clinical scoring systems and course of illness based on data in medical records. RESULTS In the period 9-31 March 2020, 42 patients, of whom 28 (67 %) were men, were admitted to hospital with COVID-19 infection. The median age was 72.5 years (range 30-95). Fever (79 %), reduced general condition (79 %), dyspnoea (69 %) and cough (67 %) were the most common symptoms. A total of nine patients (21 %) had a critical course of illness with treatment in the Intensive Care Department and/or death during their stay in hospital. Patients with a critical course had a higher average score on National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) on admission (7.6 vs 3.3). Only one of the most severely ill patients scored \u2265 2 on the quick Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) on admission. INTERPRETATION Most patients admitted to our hospital with COVID-19 had a fever and respiratory tract symptoms. A high percentage of patients had a critical course of illness. A NEWS2 score of \u2265 5 on admission may be a useful aid in identifying patients at risk of a critical course of illness, while CRB-65 and qSOFA score \u2265 2 proved to be of little usefulness for this purpose in our material.", "Liver thermal ablation is an alternative treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and secondary liver malignancies. Microwave ablation (MWA) produces large ablation zones (AZ) in short time; however, AZ prediction is based on preclinical ex vivo models, rising concerns about reproducibility and safety in humans. We aimed to investigate the effects produced by a new-generation MWA system on human liver in vivo with different approaches (percutaneous or intraoperative) and liver conditions (cirrhosis or previous chemotherapy treatment), in comparison with manufacturer-provided predictions based on ex vivo animal models. Complete tumor ablation (CA) and early clinical outcomes were also assessed. From October 2014, 60 consecutive patients (cirrhotic = 31; non-cirrhotic = 10; chemotherapy-treated = 19) with 81 liver nodules (HCC = 31; mets = 50) underwent MWA procedures (percutaneous = 30; laparotomic = 18; laparoscopic = 12), with a 2450 MHz/100 W generator with Thermosphere\u2122 Technology (Emprint\u2122, Medtronic). A contrast-enhanced CT or MR was performed after one month to assess CA and measure AZ. A linear correlation between AZ volumes and ablation times was observed in vivo, without differences from manufacturer-provided ex vivo predictions in all operative approaches and liver conditions. Other independent variables (sex, age, nodule location) showed no relationship when added to the model. Median (IQR) longitudinal and transverse roundness-indexes of the AZs were, respectively, 0.77(0.13) and 0.93(0.11). CA at 1 month was 93% for percutaneous and 100% for intraoperative procedures (p = 0.175). Thirty-day morbidity and mortality were 3% and 0%. MWA with Thermosphere\u2122 Technology produces predictable AZs on human liver in vivo, according to manufacturer-provided ex vivo predictions. In our experience, this new-generation MWA system is effective and safe to treat liver malignancies in different operative and clinical settings.", "Glioblastomas are the most common malignant primary intrinsic brain tumors. Their incidence increases with age, and males are more often affected. First-line management includes maximum safe surgical resection followed by involved-field radiotherapy plus concomitant and six cycles of maintenance temozolomide chemotherapy. Standards of care at recurrence are much less well defined. Minorities of patients are offered second surgery or re-irradiation, but data on a positive impact on survival from randomized trials are lacking. The majority of patients who are eligible for salvage therapy receive systemic treatment, mostly with nitrosourea-based regimens or, depending on availability, bevacizumab alone or in various combinations. In clinical trials, lomustine alone has been increasingly used as a control arm, assigning this drug a standard-of-care position in the setting of recurrent glioblastoma. Here we review the activity of lomustine in the treatment of diffuse gliomas of adulthood in various settings. The most compelling data for lomustine stem from three randomized trials when lomustine was combined with procarbazine and vincristine as the PCV regimen in the newly diagnosed setting together with radiotherapy; improved survival with PCV was restricted to patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase-mutant tumors. No other agent with the possible exception of regorafenib has shown superior activity to lomustine in recurrent glioblastoma, but activity is largely restricted to patients with tumors with O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation. Hematological toxicity, notably thrombocytopenia often limits adequate exposure.", ": Diabetes is a risk factor for the progression and prognosis of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), but the relationship between glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level, inflammation, and prognosis of COVID-19 patients has not been explored. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of COVID-19 patients who underwent an HbA1c test. Their demographic data, medical history, signs and symptoms of COVID-19, laboratory test results, and final outcomes of COVID-19 treatment were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 132 patients were included and divided into three groups based on their blood glucose status. There were significant differences in SaO2, serum ferritin level, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), fibrinogen (Fbg) level, and IL6 level among the three groups. A pairwise comparison of the groups showed that groups B and C were significantly different from group A in terms of CRP, ESR, and Fbg, IL6, and serum ferritin levels (P < 0.05). Correlation analysis showed that there was a linear negative correlation between SaO2 and HbA1c (r = -0.22, P = 0.01), while there was a linear positive correlation between serum ferritin, CRP, Fbg, and ESR levels and HbA1c (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: High HbA1c level is associated with inflammation, hypercoagulability, and low SaO2 in COVID-19 patients, and the mortality rate (27.7%) is higher in patients with diabetes. Determining HbA1c level after hospital admission is thus helpful assessing inflammation, hypercoagulability, and prognosis of COVID-19 patients.", "Cytosolic bacterial pathogens must evade intracellular innate immune recognition and clearance systems such as autophagy to ensure their survival and proliferation. The intracellular cycle of the bacterium Francisella tularensis is characterized by rapid phagosomal escape followed by extensive proliferation in the macrophage cytoplasm. Cytosolic replication, but not phagosomal escape, requires the locus FTT0369c, which encodes the dipA gene (deficient in intracellular replication A). Here, we show that a replication-deficient, \u2206dipA mutant of the prototypical SchuS4 strain is eventually captured from the cytosol of murine and human macrophages into double-membrane vacuoles displaying the late endosomal marker, LAMP1, and the autophagy-associated protein, LC3, coinciding with a reduction in viable intracellular bacteria. Capture of SchuS4\u0394dipA was not dipA-specific as other replication-deficient bacteria, such as chloramphenicol-treated SchuS4 and a purine auxotroph mutant SchuS4\u0394purMCD, were similarly targeted to autophagic vacuoles. Vacuoles containing replication-deficient bacteria were labeled with ubiquitin and the autophagy receptors SQSTM1/p62 and NBR1, and their formation was decreased in macrophages from either ATG5-, LC3B- or SQSTM1-deficient mice, indicating recognition by the ubiquitin-SQSTM1-LC3 pathway. While a fraction of both the wild-type and the replication-impaired strains were ubiquitinated and recruited SQSTM1, only the replication-defective strains progressed to autophagic capture, suggesting that wild-type Francisella interferes with the autophagic cascade. Survival of replication-deficient strains was not restored in autophagy-deficient macrophages, as these bacteria died in the cytosol prior to autophagic capture. Collectively, our results demonstrate that replication-impaired strains of Francisella are cleared by autophagy, while replication-competent bacteria seem to interfere with autophagic recognition, therefore ensuring survival and proliferation.", " AND AIMS Ustekinumab is approved for the treatment of Crohn's disease (CD). Systematically registered prospective real-world data is scarce. We therefore aimed to study the effectiveness, safety and usage of ustekinumab for CD in everyday practise. METHODS We prospectively enrolled CD patients initiating ustekinumab in regular care between December 2016 and January 2019. Clinical (Harvey Bradshaw Index (HBI)), biochemical (C-reactive protein (CRP) and faecal calprotectin (FCP)), extra-intestinal manifestations, and peri-anal fistula activity, ustekinumab dosage, concomitant medication use, and adverse events were documented at week 0, 12, 24, and 52. The primary outcome was corticosteroid-free clinical remission. RESULTS In total, 221 CD patients were included (98.6% anti-TNF and 46.6% vedolizumab exposed) with a median follow-up of 52.0 weeks (IQR 49.3-58.4). The corticosteroid-free clinical remission rates at week 24 and 52 was 38.2% and 37.1%, respectively. An initial dosing schedule of 8 weeks, compared to 12 weeks, correlated with a lower discontinuation rate (20.0% vs. 42.6%, p=0.01), but comparable corticosteroid-free clinical remission at week 52 (46.3% (q8w) vs. 34.6% (q12w), p=0.20). There was no clinical benefit of combination therapy after 52 weeks when compared to ustekinumab monotherapy (combi 40.6% vs. mono 36.0% p=0.64). At baseline, 28 patients had active peri-anal fistula, of which 35.7% showed complete clinical resolution after 24 weeks. During follow-up we encountered six severe infections (3.5 per 100 patient years), all patients were on concomitant immunosuppressant therapies. Ustekinumab treatment discontinuation was observed in 75 (33.9%) patients mainly due to lack of response. CONCLUSION Ustekinumab is relatively safe and effective treatment option for CD patients with prior failure of anti-TNF and anti-integrin therapies.", " There is inconclusive evidence from observational studies to suggest that people who eat a diet rich in antioxidant vitamins (carotenoids, vitamins C, and E) or minerals (selenium and zinc) may be less likely to develop age-related macular degeneration (AMD). OBJECTIVES To determine whether or not taking antioxidant vitamin or mineral supplements, or both, prevent the development of AMD. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2017, Issue 2), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 29 March 2017), Embase Ovid (1947 to 29 March 2017), AMED (Allied and Complementary Medicine Database) (1985 to 29 March 2017), OpenGrey (System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe) (www.opengrey.eu/); searched 29 March 2017, the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch); searched 29 March 2017, ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov); searched 29 March 2017 and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en); searched 29 March 2017. We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. SELECTION CRITERIA We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing an antioxidant vitamin or mineral supplement (alone or in combination) to control. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Both review authors independently assessed risk of bias in the included studies and extracted data. One author entered data into RevMan 5; the other author checked the data entry. We pooled data using a fixed-effect model. We graded the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. MAIN RESULTS We included a total of five RCTs in this review with data available for 76,756 people. The trials were conducted in Australia, Finland, and the USA, and investigated vitamin C, vitamin E, beta-carotene, and multivitamin supplements. All trials were judged to be at low risk of bias.Four studies reported the comparison of vitamin E with placebo. Average treatment and follow-up duration ranged from 4 to 10 years. Data were available for a total of 55,614 participants. There was evidence that vitamin E supplements do not prevent the development of any AMD (risk ratio (RR) 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90 to 1.06; high-certainty evidence), and may slightly increase the risk of late AMD (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.67; moderate-certainty evidence) compared with placebo. Only one study (941 participants) reported data separately for neovascular AMD and geographic atrophy. There were 10 cases of neovascular AMD (RR 3.62, 95% CI 0.77 to 16.95; very low-certainty evidence), and four cases of geographic atrophy (RR 2.71, 95% CI 0.28 to 26.0; very low-certainty evidence). Two trials reported similar numbers of adverse events in the vitamin E and placebo groups. Another trial reported excess of haemorrhagic strokes in the vitamin E group (39 versus 23 events, hazard ratio 1.74, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.91, low-certainty evidence).Two studies reported the comparison of beta-carotene with placebo. These studies took place in Finland and the USA. Both trials enrolled men only. Average treatment and follow-up duration was 6 years and 12 years. Data were available for a total of 22,083 participants. There was evidence that beta-carotene supplements did not prevent any AMD (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.14; high-certainty evidence) nor have an important effect on late AMD (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.24; moderate-certainty evidence). Only one study (941 participants) reported data separately for neovascular AMD and geographic atrophy. There were 10 cases of neovascular AMD (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.17 to 2.15; very low-certainty evidence) and 4 cases of geographic atrophy (RR 0.31 95% CI 0.03 to 2.93; very low-certainty evidence). Beta-carotene was associated with increased risk of lung cancer in people who smoked.One study reported the comparison of vitamin C with placebo, and multivitamin (Centrum Silver) versus placebo. This was a study in men in the USA with average treatment duration and follow-up of 8 years for vitamin C and 11 years for multivitamin. Data were available for a total of 14,236 participants. AMD was assessed by self-report followed by medical record review. There was evidence that vitamin C supplementation did not prevent any AMD (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.18; high-certainty evidence) or late AMD (RR 0.94, 0.61 to 1.46; moderate-certainty evidence). There was a slight increased risk of any AMD (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.43; moderate-certainty evidence) and late AMD (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.69; moderate-certainty evidence) in the multivitamin group. Neovascular AMD and geographic atrophy were not reported separately. Adverse effects were not reported but there was possible increased risk of skin rashes in the multivitamin group.Adverse effects were not consistently reported in these eye studies, but there is evidence from other large studies that beta-carotene increases the risk of lung cancer in people who smoke or who have been exposed to asbestos.None of the studies reported quality of life or resource use and costs. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Taking vitamin E or beta-carotene supplements will not prevent or delay the onset of AMD. The same probably applies to vitamin C and the multivitamin (Centrum Silver) investigated in the one trial reported to date. There is no evidence with respect to other antioxidant supplements, such as lutein and zeaxanthin. Although generally regarded as safe, vitamin supplements may have harmful effects, and clear evidence of benefit is needed before they can be recommended. People with AMD should see the related Cochrane Review on antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplements for slowing the progression of AMD, written by the same review team.", "Direct exposure and cannulation of the superior ophthalmic vein (SOV) provides an alternative access to reach the cavernous sinus for carotid-cavernous fistula (CCF) embolization, when classic transvenous routes through the inferior petrosal sinus (IPS) or facial vein are not feasible. We have used indocyanine green (ICG)-videoangiography to study intraoperatively the flow inside the SOV in two cases of indirect CCF. In this paper, we report the operative technique and the result of ICG videoangiographic-guided cannulation of the SOV for endovascular treatment of CCF. Two male patients, of 59 and 66 years of age respectively, presented at our Institution with right decreased visual acuity, persistent binocular diplopia and painful ophthalmoplegia, chemosis and proptosis, due to right unilateral indirect CCF fistula. The endovascular transvenous approach failed in one case due to thrombosis of the inferior petrosal sinus (IPS) and the extreme tortuosity of the angular vein. In the other case, it was considered unfeasible due to an unfavourable vascular angioarchitecture. For this reason, an ICG videoangiographic-guided cannulation of the SOV, followed by endovascular obliteration of the CCF, was performed. CCF was cured in both cases with this approach. No additional neurological deficits and no complications due to SOV cannulation were registered during the hospital stay. There were no fistula recurrences during the mean follow-up of 18 months. ICG-videoangiography is a simple, fast and cost-effective technique that can be reliably applied in SOV cannulation for subsequent indirect CCF embolization.", "OBJECTIVE In December 2019, a new type of coronavirus-infected pneumonia broke out in Wuhan and spread rapidly to other parts of the country. The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical features of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective analysis was performed on the confirmed cases of COVID-19, who were admitted to the North Hospital of Changsha first Hospital (Changsha Public Health treatment Center) from January 17 to February 7, 2020. RESULTS The median age of COVID-19 patients was 45 years (range 33.5-57). The male patients accounted for 49.7%, 64.6% of the patients had a history of exposure in Wuhan, and 31.7% had family aggregation. The median days of onset were six, and the incidence of severe illness was 18.6%. Compared with the non-severe group, the severe group showed statistical significance in older age, hypertension, bilateral lung plaque shadow, decrease in lymphocyte count, increase in C-reactive protein (CRP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase. CONCLUSIONS Age, combined hypertension, oxygenation index, double lung patch, decreased lymphocyte count, and elevated levels of C-reactive protein, aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase can be used as predictors of the disease severity.", " In patients with ischemic stroke, endovascular treatment results in a higher rate of recanalization of the affected cerebral artery than systemic intravenous thrombolytic therapy. However, comparison of the clinical efficacy of the two approaches is needed. METHODS We randomly assigned 362 patients with acute ischemic stroke, within 4.5 hours after onset, to endovascular therapy (intraarterial thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator [t-PA], mechanical clot disruption or retrieval, or a combination of these approaches) or intravenous t-PA. Treatments were to be given as soon as possible after randomization. The primary outcome was survival free of disability (defined as a modified Rankin score of 0 or 1 on a scale of 0 to 6, with 0 indicating no symptoms, 1 no clinically significant disability despite symptoms, and 6 death) at 3 months. RESULTS A total of 181 patients were assigned to receive endovascular therapy, and 181 intravenous t-PA. The median time from stroke onset to the start of treatment was 3.75 hours for endovascular therapy and 2.75 hours for intravenous t-PA (P<0.001). At 3 months, 55 patients in the endovascular-therapy group (30.4%) and 63 in the intravenous t-PA group (34.8%) were alive without disability (odds ratio adjusted for age, sex, stroke severity, and atrial fibrillation status at baseline, 0.71; 95% confidence interval, 0.44 to 1.14; P=0.16). Fatal or nonfatal symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 7 days occurred in 6% of the patients in each group, and there were no significant differences between groups in the rates of other serious adverse events or the case fatality rate. CONCLUSIONS The results of this trial in patients with acute ischemic stroke indicate that endovascular therapy is not superior to standard treatment with intravenous t-PA. (Funded by the Italian Medicines Agency, ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00640367.).", "Total gastrectomy or proximal gastrectomy is usually performed either as an open procedure or laparoscopically for the treatment of early gastric cancer (EGC) in the upper stomach. However, quality of life after either total or proximal gastrectomy is not so satisfactory. The authors report a novel surgical procedure, laparoscopy-assisted subtotal gastrectomy (LAsTG), by which a very small remnant stomach is preserved, for the surgery of selected EGCs in the upper stomach. Twenty-three patients with EGC in the upper stomach underwent LAsTG. After lymph node dissection and mobilization of the stomach, the stomach was transected about 2 cm proximal to the tumor and a very small remnant stomach was preserved. An anvil was inserted transorally into the remnant stomach by using the OrVil system. The reconstruction method was Roux-en-Y, and hemidouble-stapling gastrojejunostomy with a circular stapler was performed intracorporeally. There were no intraoperative complications or conversions to open surgery. Mean operation time and blood loss were 266.7 min and 54.6 ml, respectively. The overall incidence of early postoperative complications was 17.4%, and two patients underwent reoperation because of duodenal stump leakage and stenosis of the Y-anastomosis, respectively. During the follow-up period, two patients experienced gastrojejunostomy stenosis and both were treated successfully by endoscopic balloon dilation. LAsTG may be performed in selected patients with EGC in the upper stomach. With the described method, a very small remnant stomach can be preserved.", " The technique of balloon remodeling allows the endovascular treatment of wide-neck intracranial aneurysms. For many years the only available devices were the Hyperform and the Hyperglide balloon catheters. Recently, other companies have developed newer devices, single or dual-lumen. We present our initial experience with the TransForm occlusion balloon catheter for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms. METHODS We retrospectively analysed from our prospectively gathered aneurysm database all aneurysms that were treated with balloon remodelling using TransForm occlusion balloon catheters from January 2013 to February 2014. We assessed patient demographics, morphological features of the aneurysms, procedure feasibility, technical and clinical complications. RESULTS Thirty-three patients harbouring 36 intracranial saccular aneurysms were treated during 33 procedures. Clinical finding were: 15 incidental discovery, 13 subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH), five aneurysms with mass effect, one ruptured aneurysm with SAH and mass effect, one recanalisation and one intraparenchymal haematoma. Thirty-five aneurysms were in the anterior and one in the posterior circulation. Mean dome and neck size were, respectively, 5.8 mm and 3.6 mm. Twenty-three aneurysms were treated with TransForm C and 13 with TransForm SC. We had two procedural thromboembolic complications, without permanent clinical events. No early rebleeding occurred. CONCLUSIONS In our small series, the TransForm occlusion balloon catheter seems to be safe and effective for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms, in ruptured and unruptured cases.", "CASE DESCRIPTION 5 dogs (a Newfoundland, Golden Retriever, Shiba Inu, Staffordshire Terrier, and Vizsla) were referred for evaluation and treatment of unilateral aural hematomas within a week after their formation. CLINICAL FINDINGS Aural hematomas involved the left (3) or right (2) ears. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME With patients under anesthesia, the aural hematomas were approached surgically from the convex, or lateral, pinnal surface. Two small incisions were used to position a vacuum drain into the incised hematoma cavity. The drain exited at the base of the pinna and adjacent cervical skin. The free end of the drain was attached to a vacuum reservoir for 18 to 21 days. Drains and skin sutures were removed at this time along with the protective Elizabethan collar. All hematomas resolved and surgical sites healed during the minimum 6-month follow-up period. Cosmetic results were considered excellent in 4 of 5 patients. Slight wrinkling of the pinna in 1 patient resulted from asymmetric enlargement of the cartilaginous walls of the hematoma, where vacuum application resulted in a slight folding of the redundant lateral cartilage wall. CLINICAL RELEVANCE The described treatment was efficient, economical, and minimally invasive and required no bandaging or wound care. Placement of the drain tubing on the convex (lateral) aspect sheltered the system from displacement by patients with an Elizabethan collar in place. Overall cosmetic results were excellent; asymmetric enlargement of the cartilaginous walls of the hematoma with slight folding of the pinna was seen in 1 patient.", "OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to assess the correlation between central venous pressure (CVP) and venous blood gas (VBG) analysis parameters, to facilitate management of severe sepsis and septic shock in emergency department. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This diagnostic study was conducted from January 2014 until June 2015 in three major educational medical centers, Tehran, Iran. For patients selected with diagnosis of septic shock, peripheral blood sample was taken for testing the VBG parameters and the anion gap (AG) was calculated. All the mentioned parameters were measured again after infusion of 500 cc of normal saline 0.9% in about 1 h. RESULTS: Totally, 93 patients with septic shock were enrolled, 63 male and 30 female. The mean age was 72.53 \u00b1 13.03 and the mean Shock Index (SI) before fluid therapy was 0.79 \u00b1 0.30. AG and pH showed significant negative correlations with CVP, While HCO3 showed a significant positive correlation with CVP. These relations can be affected by the treatment modalities used in shock management such as fluid therapy, mechanical ventilation and vasopressor treatment. CONCLUSION: It is likely that there is a significant statistical correlation between VBG parameters and AG with CVP, but further research is needed before implementation of the results of this study.", "Liver failure is associated to high mortality due to the accumulation of protein-bound metabolites, such as bilirubin, not removed by conventional hemodialysis. Different methods can efficiently remove them, such as the molecular adsorbent recirculating system (MARS), plasma exchange (PEX), and bilirubin or plasma adsorption perfusion (PAP). No direct comparison exists between MARS, PEX and PAP, and current guidelines do not specify which method (and when) to use. We have retrospectively evaluated MARS, PEX and PAP in their effectiveness in lowering plasma bilirubin concentration, and their effects on liver and kidney function. A total of 98 patients have been recruited, which comprised 68 patients treated with PAP (177 sessions), 16 patients with PEX (41 sessions) and 11 patients with MARS (21 sessions). Bilirubin, creatinine, liver enzymes were analyzed before and after the first treatment with each technique. The three methods did not differ for bilirubin lowering efficiency, with MARS showing only slightly less effective reductions. Finally, the three techniques did not differ in the amount of change of cholinesterase, but a lower reduction in AST was found using PAP. Our retrospective observation is one of the largest case series of hepatic failure treated with bilirubin absorption. The choice of the technique cannot be based on the desired reduction in bilirubin concentration. Based on costs and duration of treatment, we suggest that PAP could be considered as a first-line approach. In case of kidney involvement, MARS remains a valuable option.", "Neutrophil Elastase Inhibitors: A potential prophylactic treatment option for SARS-CoV-2-induced respiratory complications?", " Certain proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) interfere with clopidogrel metabolism, potentially attenuating P2Y12 receptor inhibition. Previous observational and randomized trials report conflicting results regarding the clinical significance of this pharmacological interaction. We examined the interaction between concomitant administration of PPI and clopidogrel on platelet reactivity and clinical outcomes in the large-scale, prospective Assessment of Dual AntiPlatelet Therapy With Drug-Eluting Stents study. METHODS AND RESULTS On-treatment P2Y12 platelet reactivity testing was performed using the VerifyNow assay after clopidogrel loading and successful drug-eluting stent implantation at 11 sites in the United States and Germany. PPIs were prescribed at the discretion of treating physicians; patients were followed for 2 years. High platelet reactivity was defined as P2Y12 reactivity units >208. Of 8582 enrolled patients, 2697 (31.4%) were taking a PPI at the time of coronary intervention. After adjustment for differences in baseline characteristics, PPI use was independently associated with high platelet reactivity (odds ratio, 1.38: 95% confidence interval, 1.25-1.52, P=0.0001). A total of 2162 (25.2%) patients were prescribed a PPI at hospital discharge. In a propensity-adjusted multivariable analysis, discharge PPI use was independently associated with increased risk for postdischarge major adverse cardiac events (cardiac death, myocardial infarction, or ischemia-driven target lesion revascularization) at 2-year follow-up (hazard ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.42, P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS In patients treated with clopidogrel after successful drug-eluting stents implantation, the concomitant administration of PPI was associated with high platelet reactivity and a greater rate of adverse outcomes during long-term follow-up. Additional studies are warranted to determine the risk-benefit ratio of PPIs in patients with drug-eluting stents treated with clopidogrel. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Unique identifier: NCT00433966.", " Acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) is the most common reason for antibiotic prescription in adults. Antibiotics are often inappropriately prescribed for patients with ARTI. This article presents best practices for antibiotic use in healthy adults (those without chronic lung disease or immunocompromising conditions) presenting with ARTI. METHODS A narrative literature review of evidence about appropriate antibiotic use for ARTI in adults was conducted. The most recent clinical guidelines from professional societies were complemented by meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and randomized clinical trials. To identify evidence-based articles, the Cochrane Library, PubMed, MEDLINE, and EMBASE were searched through September 2015 using the following Medical Subject Headings terms: \"acute bronchitis,\" \"respiratory tract infection,\" \"pharyngitis,\" \"rhinosinusitis,\" and \"the common cold.\" HIGH-VALUE CARE ADVICE 1 Clinicians should not perform testing or initiate antibiotic therapy in patients with bronchitis unless pneumonia is suspected. HIGH-VALUE CARE ADVICE 2 Clinicians should test patients with symptoms suggestive of group A streptococcal pharyngitis (for example, persistent fevers, anterior cervical adenitis, and tonsillopharyngeal exudates or other appropriate combination of symptoms) by rapid antigen detection test and/or culture for group A Streptococcus. Clinicians should treat patients with antibiotics only if they have confirmed streptococcal pharyngitis. HIGH-VALUE CARE ADVICE 3 Clinicians should reserve antibiotic treatment for acute rhinosinusitis for patients with persistent symptoms for more than 10 days, onset of severe symptoms or signs of high fever (>39 \u00b0C) and purulent nasal discharge or facial pain lasting for at least 3 consecutive days, or onset of worsening symptoms following a typical viral illness that lasted 5 days that was initially improving (double sickening). HIGH-VALUE CARE ADVICE 4 Clinicians should not prescribe antibiotics for patients with the common cold.", " Casts are used to treat clubfeet, developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH), forearm fractures, and femur fractures. The ability of a cast to maintain a desired shape is termed moldability. Clinicians use plaster, fiberglass, and soft casts. To our knowledge the biomechanical molding characteristics of these 3 materials have never been reported. We hypothesized that moldability of plaster would be better than fiberglass and fiberglass would be better than soft cast. METHODS We compared 12.7 cm wide casts of plaster, fiberglass, and soft cast. Casts were 5 layers thick, prepared in 40\u00b0C water, and placed over 2 layers of cotton padding on 5.1 cm and 15.2 cm diameter foam cylinders. A loading device simulated loads applied by clinicians when molding casts for 4 conditions: clubfoot (thumb-shaped 50 N load on 5.1 cm model), DDH (thumb-shaped 100 N load on 15.2 cm model), forearm fracture (palm-shaped 50 N load on 5.1 cm model), and femur fracture (palm-shaped 100 N load on 15.2 cm model). The loading device applied molding for 7 minutes. Five casts of each material were made for each model. Casts were removed, photographed, and the area of maximal deformation was compared with an unmolded cast. A large area of maximal deformation meant that the deformation was spread out over a large area, less precise molding. RESULTS In the clubfoot model, plaster was more precise than fiberglass (P=0.002) and soft cast (P<0.0001). In the DDH model, plaster was more precise than fiberglass (P<0.0001) and soft cast (P<0.0001) and fiberglass was more precise than soft cast (P<0.0001).In the femur fracture model, plaster was more precise than fiberglass (P=0.001) and soft cast (P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS The moldability of plaster is better than fiberglass and soft cast and fiberglass is better than soft cast. CLINICAL RELEVANCE If precise molding is required, plaster has the best moldability. In cases not requiring precise molding, fiberglass and soft cast are lightweight, waterproof, and available in child-friendly colors.", "OBJECTIVES Extraction socket preservation procedures are critical to successful esthetic implant therapy. Conventional surgical approaches are technique sensitive and often result in alteration of the soft tissue architecture, which then requires additional corrective surgical procedures. This case series report presents the ability of flapless surgical techniques combined with a growth factor-enhanced bone matrix to provide esthetic ridge preservation at the time of extraction for compromised sockets. CLINICAL CONSIDERATIONS When considering esthetic dental implant therapy, preservation, or further enhancement of the available tissue support at the time of tooth extraction may provide an improved esthetic outcome with reduced postoperative sequelae and decreased treatment duration. Advances in minimally invasive surgical techniques combined with recombinant growth factor technology offer an alternative for bone reconstruction while maintaining the gingival architecture for enhanced esthetic outcome. The combination of freeze-dried bone allograft (FDBA) and rhPDGF-BB (platelet-derived growth factor-BB) provides a growth-factor enhanced matrix to induce bone and soft tissue healing. CONCLUSIONS The use of a growth-factor enhanced matrix is an option for minimally invasive ridge preservation procedures for sites with advanced bone loss. Further studies including randomized clinical trials are needed to better understand the extent and limits of these procedures. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE The use of minimally invasive techniques with growth factors for esthetic ridge preservation reduces patient morbidity associated with more invasive approaches and increases the predictability for enhanced patient outcomes. By reducing the need for autogenous bone grafts the use of this technology is favorable for patient acceptance and ease of treatment process for esthetic dental implant therapy.", "The guidewire (GW) is probably the most important tool for the endovascular treatment of arterial obstructions. In fact, the treatment of a lesion is only possible when the GW is passed beyond the target lesion. Lower limb percutaneous arterial revascularisation can be achieved using a variety of GWs which may differ in calibre, body, tip or coating. As the choice of an appropriate GW is critical for the success of a lower limb artery angioplasty, knowledge of the properties and performances of different GWs should be well known in order to tailor the choice of the device to the lesion characteristics and location, as well as to the intended revascularisation strategy. The aim of the present paper is to describe the constructive characteristics of GWs for lower limb arterial revascularisation, and to evaluate groups of GWs for each segment of the lower limb arterial vasculature.", " AND PURPOSE The goal of stent retriever-based thrombectomy is removal of embolic clots in patients with intracranial large artery occlusion. However, outcomes of stent retrieval may differ between acute arterial occlusions due to intracranial atherosclerotic disease (IAD) and those due to embolism. This case series describes the outcomes of stent retriever-based thrombectomy and rescue treatments in 9 patients with IAD-related occlusion. METHODS Among patients who underwent endovascular treatment for acute intracranial large artery occlusion, those in whom stent retrieval was attempted as first-line treatment were included in this review. IAD was defined as significant fixed focal stenosis at the occlusion site, which was evident on final angiographic assessment or observed during endovascular treatment. RESULTS Median number of stent retriever passes was 2 (range, 1-3), and temporary bypass was seen in all patients. Immediate partial recanalization (arterial occlusive lesion grade 2-3) was observed in 7 patients. Immediate modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction grade 2b-3 was seen in 6 patients, but the lesions often required rescue treatment due to reocclusion or flow insufficiency. In terms of rescue treatments, angioplasty and intra-arterial tirofiban infusion seemed to be effective. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that stent retrieval can effectively remove thrombi from stenotic lesions and achieve partial recanalization despite the tendency toward reocclusion in most patients with IAD-related occlusion. Further research into the use of rescue treatments, such as tirofiban infusion and angioplasty, is warranted.", "The National Task Force for Covid-19 of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in a bulletin dated March 21, 2020 recommended the use of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis in asymptomatic health care workers caring for suspected or confirmed patients and household contacts of confirmed patients. This is cause for concern with regard to bioethics and good clinical practice. The evidence for the efficacy of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine is currently derived from open label trials and cell culture studies with no conclusive evidence available from randomised clinical trials. Hydroxychloroquine also carries contraindications in the case of conditions such as maculopathy, retinopathy and QTc prolongation and should be used with caution in vulnerable populations such as children, pregnancy, lactation and the elderly. Despite this, there has been a rush to procure and self-medicate with hydroxychloroquine, which has been addressed by the National Task Force. The WHO and the FDA have not found adequate evidence to recommend any specific medication for the treatment of Covid-19. While further evidence is awaited, including from trials registered with the FDA and the ICMR, it is recommended that the administration of hydroxychloroquine for chemo-prophylaxis be considered on a case by case basis with monitoring by a registered medical practitioner including electrocardiography (ECG). The potential for retinal and cardiac toxicity must also be borne in mind. It is further recommended that a public advisory regarding the need for caution in chemo-prophylaxis be made available in the public domain. Keywords: Coronavirus, Covid-19, SARS-CoV-2, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, chemoprophylaxis, bioethics, evidence- based medicine.", "PURPOSE Onyx has been successfully applied in the treatment of various neurovascular lesions. However, some experience is required to get accustomed to its unpredictable fluoroscopic visibility during injection. This in vitro study aimed to evaluate the characteristics of radiopacity change in a simulated embolization procedure. MATERIALS AND METHODS Using a bench-top Onyx injection experiment simulating a typical brain arteriovenous malformation embolization, nine cycles of casting modes (continuous injection) and plugging modes (injection with intermittent pauses) were performed. Radiodensity of Onyx droplets collected from the microcatheter tip and the distal head portion of the microcatheter were measured as time lapsed. Distribution of droplet radiodensity (radiodensity) and distribution of radiographic grade (grade) were analyzed and compared by repeated measurements. RESULTS Within-group analysis revealed no significant radiodensity change with time (P>0.05). The radiodensity was significantly higher in the casting mode than in the plugging mode (P<0.01). The lateral radiograph of the microcatheter showed higher radiopacity (P<0.01) and better evenness (P<0.01) in the casting mode than in the plugging mode. A significant difference in microcatheter attenuation (both radiographic grade mean and SD; P<0.01) was noted between the two modes. Radiodensity had a significant influence on the radiopacity and radiopacity evenness of the microcatheter. CONCLUSION The radiopacity of the Onyx can vary significantly over time because of early precipitation of tantalum powder. Radiopacity decreased significantly during plugging modes, characterized by pauses between injections.", " The treatment of incisional and ventral hernias is associated with significant complications and recurrences, especially in severely obese patients. Recent studies have shown a reduced rate of surgical site infections and length of hospital stay in severely obese patients undergoing a laparoscopic ventral hernia repair. AIM This study aims to describe the clinical experience in terms of efficacy and safety with laparoscopic ventral hernia repair using the ParietexTM Composite mesh (Covidien Sofradim Production, Trevoux, France) in severely obese patients (body mass index \u226535) compared with non-severe obese patients in a seven-year single-center cohort. MATERIAL AND METHODS All patients with a primary ventral or incisional hernia admitted to our hospital from 2006 until December 2012 who underwent a laparoscopic repair with the Parietex Composite mesh were included in this study. Pain scores using a numeric rating were collected prospectively 24-48 hours postoperatively. Patient data were retrospectively collected. RESULTS A total number of 210 patients were included; 173 with a BMI <35 and 37 with a BMI \u226535. Mean follow-up was 31 months. No statistically significant differences were found with regard to operation time, hospital stay, use of analgesics and postoperative complications. The long-term follow up recurrence rate in non-severely obese patients was 13% compared to 16% in severely obese patients (p = .60). CONCLUSION Laparoscopic ventral and incisional hernia repair using the Parietex Composite mesh is feasible and safe in severely obese patients compared to non-severely obese patients.", "Several commercial models of stapler devices are available. This study evaluated the ease of use, effectiveness and safety of new commercial stapling devices for gastrointestinal anastomosis. A total of 11 patients (5 men) requiring surgical therapy for benign or malignant disease of the digestive tract were recruited between July and October 2006. Eleven patients were treated with KYGW circular stapler or KYFB linear stapler (Changzhou Kangdi Medical Stapler). In these patients, 14 staplers were used and 21 stapled sutures (16 linear, 5 circular) were performed. Number of anastomoses successfully completed, postoperative anastomotic fistula or dehiscence, days to take fluid and normal diet, length of hospital stay and anastomotic stenosis were recorded. A 10-point questionnaire enquiring about the instrument and anastomotic features was administered to surgeons immediately after the operation in the study group and in 10 control patients treated with standard CDH circular and SDH linear staples (Ethicon Endo-Surgery). Mean scores on the questionnaire for the experimental and control groups were good (>7.5) and did not significantly differ for handling, closing ease, bleeding, and overall satisfaction. No case of intra-abdominal sepsis, leakage or intestinal obstruction was recorded in the study group. In the 5 patients with colorectal anastomosis, the anastomotic lumen at 15 days was wide open and at 3 months there were no strictures. These new instruments are valuable for performing gastrointestinal anastomosis and are in conformity with clinical requirements; their use is simple and seems to be safe.", "UNLABELLED Renal sympathetic denervation (RDN) is an emerging technique in the treatment of resistant hypertension, most commonly performed using an endovascular approach. Clinical and anatomical criteria for RDN are well established and imaging plays an integral role in selecting patients with suitable anatomy, procedural planning and device selection. Nevertheless, the current body of literature surrounding imaging related to RDN remains limited. The purpose of this article is to illustrate the expectations and limitations of various imaging techniques, including Doppler ultrasound, CT angiography, MR angiography and newer techniques such as non-contrast MR angiography, in the context of RDN. KEY POINTS \u2022 To understand the role of imaging in renal denervation \u2022 To understand strengths and weaknesses of current imaging techniques \u2022 To understand the relevant imaging findings in the context of renal denervation.", "PURPOSE This retrospective, single-center study evaluated radiofrequency (RF) ablation for pulmonary metastases of sarcoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS Forty-six patients with sarcoma (144 pulmonary metastases) underwent 88 RF ablation sessions. Data regarding local tumor progression, efficacy, procedural adverse events (AEs; National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0), overall survival (OS), and OS-associated prognostic factors were retrospectively evaluated using univariate analyses. RESULTS Local progression occurred in 22 of 144 tumors (15.3%). Primary and secondary efficacy rates were 83.5 and 90.0% at 1 year and 76.3 and 81.4% at 2 years, respectively. Seventy-three grade 1 AEs, 33 grade 2 AEs, and no grade \u2265 3 AEs were observed. Twenty-eight patients (60.9%) remained alive and 18 died, yielding 1-, 2-, and 3-year OS rates of 80.6, 70.1, and 47.1% (median survival time, 31.7 months). Univariate analysis revealed extrapulmonary metastasis (P = 0.005), noncurative RF ablation (P = 0.009), and a post-RF ablation disease-free interval of \u226412 months (P = 0.015) as significant negative prognostic factors. CONCLUSION RF ablation is safe, offers good local control, and may be a viable treatment option for pulmonary metastasis of sarcoma.", "The number of infectious disease outbreaks and the number of unique pathogens responsible have significantly increased since the 1980s. HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM) are a vulnerable population with regards to the introduction, spread and clinical consequences of (newly introduced) STIs. After the introduction of combination antiretroviral treatment (cART), the incidence of sexually acquired hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and human papillomavirus (HPV)-induced anal cancers have significantly increased among HIV-positive MSM. The introduction and expansion of HCV is the result of increased sexual risk behaviour and sexually acquired mucosal trauma within large interconnected networks of HIV-positive MSM in particular. With the availability of cART, postexposure and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PEP and PrEP) and direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) for HCV, less concern for HIV and HCV might require a new approach to develop effective behavioural intervention strategies among MSM. The marked rise in HPV-induced anal cancers can be ascribed to the long-term immunologic defects in an ageing population affected by HIV. More evidence with regards to effective treatment options for anal dysplastic lesions and the usefulness of anal malignancy screening programmes is urgently needed. Most anal cancers in the future generation of HIV-positive MSM could be prevented with the inclusion of boys in addition to girls in current HPV vaccination programmes.", "PURPOSE To describe planning and a technique for fenestrated endovascular repair of a large Crawford type IV thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm after previous 2-fenestration endovascular aneurysm repair (FEVAR). TECHNIQUE The first FEVAR procedure performed at another center implanted a standard Zenith device with 2 fenestrations and 1 scallop for a juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm. The diameter of the Crawford type IV thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm had progressed from 68 to 75 mm within a year after the FEVAR. Since the celiac trunk was already occluded, a 3-fenestration 22-\u00d7172-mm stent-graft was chosen to extend the existing stent-graft further proximally. A tapered 38/22-\u00d7179-mm Zenith custom-made device was designed for the thoracic component. The technique addresses several issues that arise during a FEVAR-in-FEVAR case, such as the orientation of the new stent-graft and its fenestrations, the absence of space between the 2 devices for maneuvers, and the difficulty in catheterizing target vessels with existing bridging stents, for which a bailout \"snare-ride\" maneuver is described. CONCLUSION FEVAR after previous FEVAR is a feasible and efficient treatment option. The modified \"snare-ride\" technique can be used to catheterize target vessels in the absence of an Indy snare.", "Porous carbon monoliths (PCMs) were prepared from waste corrugated cardboard box (WCCB) via slurrying in FeCl(3) solution followed by molding and thermal treatment. The thermal process was analyzed by a thermogravimetric analyzer coupled with a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. The evolution of physicochemical characteristics of PCMs was studied. The photothermal conversion and solar steam generation performances of the optimal sample (PCM(Fe/600)) were evaluated. The adsorption properties of PCM(Fe/600) for methylene blue (MB) were investigated. Results showed that Fe(3+) promoted the breaking of cellulose chains in WCCB, leading to the occurrence of pyrolysis of WCCB at lower temperatures and the reduction of activation energy by 76.63 kJ mol(\u22121). Char yield raised because volatile radicals were captured by FeCl(3)-derived amorphous Fe(III) species, then involved in char formation. Amorphous Fe(III) continuously converted into Fe(3)O(4) crystallites with carbonization temperature increasing from 400 to 700 \u00b0C, then \u03b1-Fe was formed at 800 \u00b0C via the carbothermal reduction of Fe(3)O(4). FeCl(3) was favorable to the formation of a developed microporous structure. Surface area significantly increased with carbonization temperature increasing from 400 to 600 \u00b0C due to the removal of volatiles. The etching of carbon by Fe(3)O(4) above 700 \u00b0C also led to the increase of surface area. PCM(Fe/600) exhibited higher optical absorption than other samples due to its high graphite degree and porosity. It also had excellent photothermal performance; thus, solar steam yield was 1.46 times that of the pure water with the assistance of PCM(Fe/600). PCM(Fe/600) in floating state was effective in adsorption of MB from water. Besides, the adsorption behavior fitted Langmuir model with a monolayer adsorption capacity reached up to 70.9 mg g(\u22121).", "OBJECTIVES To describe our buried penis repair technique that includes penile release, tissue resection, wound closure, and penile reconstruction. PATIENTS AND METHODS In all, 73 patients were treated from 2007 to 2017. Patients can be categorised into five stages: Stage I, involves only a phimotic band; Stage 2, required excision of diseased penile skin with split-thickness skin grafting (STSG); Stage 3, requires scrotal excision; Stage 4, requires escutcheonectomy; and Stage 5, requires panniculectomy. Successful treatment hinges on adequate excision of diseased skin and de-bulking followed by replacement of deficient skin with STSG. RESULTS In all, 36 of 73 (49%) patients had Stage 1-3 disease, whilst 37 of 73 (51%) were Stage 4-5. There were complications within the first 30 days in 44 of 73 (60%) patients. In all, 62 of 73 (85%) patients either had no complications or Clavien-Dindo grade I-II complications and nine (12%) had complications beyond 30 days. Only five of 36 (14%) patients with Stage 1-3 disease had complications. One patient developed recurrent phimosis. CONCLUSION The buried penis is a challenging surgical entity where conservative treatment will most likely lead to failure. Surgery is the only means for a lasting cure in these patients and should be used as a first-line treatment. One should expect complications postoperatively, especially within the first 30 days; however, these are mostly limited to Clavien-Dindo grade I-II complications.", "PURPOSE The validity of measuring cardiac output (CO) using thermodilution via pulmonary artery catheterization in the presence of tricuspid regurgitation (TR) remains controversial. METHODS We compared the accuracy and precision of a non-invasive cardiac output (NICO) monitor and of thermodilution with those of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) to measure CO in 50 patients who underwent elective valvoplasty to treat TR (26 mild and 24 moderate-to-severe) and in 25 normal controls (without TR). We used TEE as a reference method to measure CO and to intraoperatively grade TR. RESULTS The differences between NICO monitor and TEE measurements in patients without TR and in those with mild and with moderate-to-severe TR were -0.17 +/- 0.88 (n = 150, r (2) = 0.75), -0.16 +/- 0.82 (n = 158, r (2) = 0.78), and 0.17 +/- 0.91 L/min (n = 155, r (2) = 0.78), respectively. The differences between bolus thermodilution cardiac output and TEE measurements in patients without TR and in those with mild and with moderate-to-severe TR were -0.08 +/- 0.55 (r (2) = 0.88), 0.05 +/- 0.61 (r (2) = 0.86), and 0.43 +/- 1.37 L/min (r (2) = 0.58), respectively. CONCLUSION These findings demonstrate that measuring CO using the thermodilution technique is less accurate in patients with moderate-to-severe TR and that the NICO monitor is more accurate for such patients. We postulate that the NICO monitor measures CO more accurately and reproducibly than thermodilution in patients with coexisting TR.", " Symptomatic slow-acting drugs for osteoarthritis (SYSADOAs) are an important drug class in the treatment armamentarium for osteoarthritis (OA). OBJECTIVE We aimed to re-assess the safety of various SYSADOAs in a comprehensive meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials, using, as much as possible, data from full safety reports. METHODS We performed a systematic review and random-effects meta-analyses of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials that assessed adverse events (AEs) with various SYSADOAs in patients with OA. The databases MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Ovid CENTRAL) and Scopus were searched. The primary outcomes were overall severe and serious AEs, as well as AEs involving the following Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) system organ classes (SOCs): gastrointestinal, cardiac, vascular, nervous system, skin and subcutaneous tissue, musculoskeletal and connective tissue, renal and urinary system. RESULTS Database searches initially identified 3815 records. After exclusions according to the selection criteria, 25 studies on various SYSADOAs were included in the qualitative synthesis, and 13 studies with adequate data were included in the meta-analyses. Next, from the studies previously excluded according to the protocol, 37 with mainly oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) permitted as concomitant medication were included in a parallel qualitative synthesis, from which 18 studies on various SYSADOAs were included in parallel meta-analyses. This post hoc parallel inclusion was conducted because of the high number of studies allowing concomitant anti-OA medications. Indeed, primarily excluding studies with concomitant anti-OA medications was crucial for a meta-analysis on safety. The decision for parallel inclusion was made for the purpose of comparative analyses. Glucosamine sulfate (GS), chondroitin sulfate (CS) and avocado soybean unsaponifiables (ASU; Piascledine\u00ae) were not associated with increased odds for any type of AEs compared with placebo. Overall, with/without concomitant OA medication, diacerein was associated with significantly increased odds of total AEs (odds ratio [OR] 2.22; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.58-3.13; I2 = 52.8%), gastrointestinal disorders (OR 2.85; 95% CI 2.02-4.04; I2 = 62.8%) and renal and urinary disorders (OR 3.42; 95% CI 2.36-4.96; I2 = 17.0%) compared with placebo. In studies that allowed concomitant OA medications, diacerein was associated with significantly more dermatological disorders (OR 2.47; 95% CI 1.42-4.31; I2 = 0%) and more dropouts due to AEs (OR 3.18; 95% CI 1.85-5.47; I2 = 13.4%) than was placebo. No significant increase in serious or severe AEs was found with diacerein versus placebo. CONCLUSIONS GS and CS can be considered safe treatments for patients with OA. All eligible studies on ASU included in our analysis used the proprietary product Piascledine\u00ae and allowed other anti-OA medications; thus, the safety of ASU must be confirmed in future studies without concomitant anti-OA medications. Given the safety concerns with diacerein, its usefulness in patients with OA should be assessed, taking into account individual patient characteristics.", " AND PURPOSE High blood pressure (BP) is associated with poor outcome and the occurrence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage in acute ischemic stroke. Whether BP influences the benefit or safety of intra-arterial treatment (IAT) is not known. We aimed to assess the relation of BP with functional outcome, occurrence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and effect of IAT. METHODS This is a post hoc analysis of the MR CLEAN (Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment of Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands). BP was measured at baseline, before IAT or stroke unit admission. We estimated the association of baseline BP with the score on the modified Rankin Scale at 90 days and safety parameters with ordinal and logistic regression analysis. Effect of BP on the effect of IAT was tested with multiplicative interaction terms. RESULTS Systolic BP (SBP) had the best correlation with functional outcome. This correlation was U-shaped; both low and high baseline SBP were associated with poor functional outcome. Higher SBP was associated with symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (adjusted odds ratio, 1.25 for every 10 mm Hg higher SBP [95% confidence interval, 1.09-1.44]). Between SBP and IAT, there was no interaction for functional outcome, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, or other safety parameters; the absolute benefit of IAT was evident for the whole SBP range. The same was found for diastolic BP. CONCLUSIONS BP does not affect the benefit or safety of IAT in patients with acute ischemic stroke caused by proximal intracranial vessel occlusion. Our data provide no arguments to withhold or delay IAT based on BP. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION URL: https://www.isrctn.com.

Balancing the need to avoid delays in the diagnosis of breast cancer while avoiding infection requires careful attention to personal protective equipment and physical distancing and vigilance to maintain these practices. The Canadian Society of Breast Imaging/Canadian Association of Radiologists guideline for breast imaging during COVID-19 is provided based on priority according to risk of breast cancer and impact of delaying treatment. A review of the best practices is presented that allow breast imaging during COVID-19 to maximize protection of patients, technologists, residents, fellows, and radiologists and minimize spread of the infection. The collateral damage of delaying diagnosis of breast cancer due to COVID-19 should be avoided when possible.", "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is associated with an outbreak of more than 90 cases of severe pneumonia with high mortality (greater than 50%). To date, there are no antiviral drugs or specific therapies to treat MERS-CoV. To rapidly identify potential inhibitors of MERS-CoV replication, we expressed the papain-like protease (PLpro) and the 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) from MERS-CoV and developed luciferase-based biosensors to monitor protease activity in cells. We show that the expressed MERS-CoV PLpro recognizes and processes the canonical CoV-PLpro cleavage site RLKGG in the biosensor. However, existing CoV PLpro inhibitors were unable to block MERS-CoV PLpro activity, likely due to the divergence of the amino acid sequence in the drug binding site. To investigate MERS-CoV 3CLpro activity, we expressed the protease in context with flanking nonstructural protein 4 (nsp4) and the amino-terminal portion of nsp6 and detected processing of the luciferase-based biosensors containing the canonical 3CLpro cleavage site VRLQS. Importantly, we found that a small-molecule inhibitor that blocks replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) CoV and murine CoV also inhibits the activity of MERS-CoV 3CLpro. Overall, the protease expression and biosensor assays developed here allow for rapid evaluation of viral protease activity and the identification of protease inhibitors. These biosensor assays can now be used to screen for MERS-CoV-specific or broad-spectrum coronavirus PLpro and 3CLpro inhibitors.", "Untreated mental health disorders among people living with HIV (PLHIV) may prevent low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) from achieving the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets. Anxiety disorders may be associated with decreased adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART). We sought to review and meta-analyze studies estimating associations between anxiety and ART adherence in LMICs. We searched PubMed, PsychINFO, CINAHL and EMBASE for relevant studies published before July 18, 2018. We defined anxiety as reported anxiety scores from screening questionnaires or having a clinical diagnosis of an anxiety disorder, and poor ART adherence as missed doses, poor visit attendance, or scores from structured adherence questionnaires. We used a random effects model to conduct a meta-analysis for calculating a pooled odds ratio, and conducted sensitivity analyses by time on ART, anxiety evaluation method, and study region. From 472 screened manuscripts, thirteen studies met our inclusion criteria. Eleven studies were included in the meta-analysis. PLHIV who reported anxiety had 59% higher odds of poor ART adherence compared with those who did not report anxiety disorder (pooled odds ratio [pOR]: 1.59, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.29-1.96, p < 0.001). When excluding PLHIV who initiated ART within 6 months, reported anxiety remained strongly associated with poor ART adherence (pOR: 1.61, 95% CI 1.18-2.20, p = 0.003). Among PLHIV in LMICs, reported anxiety was associated with poor ART adherence. This association persisted after the ART initiation period. Increased resources for mental health may be important for achieving virologic suppression in LMICs.", " Macrophages can imbibe low-density lipoprotein (LDL) through scavenger receptors to become foam cells, which is critical in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis. Mounting evidence suggests that the anti-inflammatory nature of Chinese herbs have the capacity to halt the complex mechanisms underlying atherosclerosis. This study examined the effects of Chinese herbs on foam cell formation. METHODS Chinese herbs were obtained from the Sun Ten pharmaceutic company. Using oxidized LDL (OxLDL) uptake and a cell toxicity assay, we screened more than 30 types of Chinese herbs. Western blotting was used to determine expressions of scavenger receptors (SRs) and extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activities. RESULTS We found that Gentiana scabra reduced oxidized LDL uptake effectively in THP-1 macrophages (p < 0.05 vs. OxLDL treated control). Moreover, treatment with Gentiana scabra in THP-1 macrophages resulted in decreased expression of scavenger receptor- A (SR-A) (p < 0.05 vs. control). Molecular investigation revealed that Gentiana scabra inhibited SR-A protein expression, possibly by regulating ERK signaling pathways (p < 0.05 vs. control). CONCLUSIONS By regulating SR-A expression, Gentiana scabra reduced oxidized LDL uptake in human macrophages. These results support the potential use of Gentiana scabra in treating atherosclerosis.", "Immunosuppression required to prevent allograft rejection in the solid organ transplant recipient increases vulnerability to infections. Given continuous environmental exposure, the lungs are increasingly susceptible to bacterial, viral, and fungal opportunistic infections. Drug therapy options for the treatment of opportunistic pulmonary infections are used infrequently. These medications are often classified as high risk with specific administration instructions, as well as a multitude of toxicities. Therefore, in this article, we will discuss select pulmonary opportunistic infections and their associated drug therapies.", "This comprehensive review outlines the impact of military-relevant respiratory infections, with special attention to recruit training environments, influenza pandemics in 1918 to 1919 and 2009 to 2010, and peacetime operations and conflicts in the past 25 years. Outbreaks and epidemiologic investigations of viral and bacterial infections among high-risk groups are presented, including (i) experience by recruits at training centers, (ii) impact on advanced trainees in special settings, (iii) morbidity sustained by shipboard personnel at sea, and (iv) experience of deployed personnel. Utilizing a pathogen-by-pathogen approach, we examine (i) epidemiology, (ii) impact in terms of morbidity and operational readiness, (iii) clinical presentation and outbreak potential, (iv) diagnostic modalities, (v) treatment approaches, and (vi) vaccine and other control measures. We also outline military-specific initiatives in (i) surveillance, (ii) vaccine development and policy, (iii) novel influenza and coronavirus diagnostic test development and surveillance methods, (iv) influenza virus transmission and severity prediction modeling efforts, and (v) evaluation and implementation of nonvaccine, nonpharmacologic interventions.", " Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is an effective and safe therapy for major depressive disorder (MDD). This study assessed quality of life (QOL) and functional status outcomes for depressed patients after an acute course of TMS. METHODS Forty-two, U.S.-based, clinical TMS practice sites treated 307 outpatients with a primary diagnosis of MDD and persistent symptoms despite prior adequate antidepressant pharmacotherapy. Treatment parameters were based on individual clinical considerations and followed the labeled procedures for use of the approved TMS device. Patient self-reported QOL outcomes included change in the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) and the EuroQol 5-Dimensions (EQ-5D) ratings from baseline to end of the acute treatment phase. RESULTS Statistically significant improvement in functional status on a broad range of mental health and physical health domains was observed on the SF-36 following acute TMS treatment. Similarly, statistically significant improvement in patient-reported QOL was observed on all domains of the EQ-5D and on the General Health Perception and Health Index scores. Improvement on these measures was observed across the entire range of baseline depression symptom severity. CONCLUSION These data confirm that TMS is effective in the acute treatment of MDD in routine clinical practice settings. This symptom benefit is accompanied by statistically and clinically meaningful improvements in patient-reported QOL and functional status outcomes.", "OBJECTIVES: Glycoproteins are organic compounds formed from proteins and carbohydrates, which are found in many parts of the living systems including the cell membranes. Furthermore, impaired metabolism of glycoprotein components plays the main role in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus. The aim of this study is to investigate the influence of glycoprotein levels in the treatment of diabetes mellitus. METHODS: All relevant papers in the English language were compiled by searching electronic databases, including Scopus, PubMed and Cochrane library. The keywords of glycoprotein, diabetes mellitus, glycan, glycosylation, and inhibitor were searched until January 2019. RESULTS: Glycoproteins are pivotal elements in the regulation of cell proliferation, growth, maturation and signaling pathways. Moreover, they are involved in drug binding, drug transportation, efflux of chemicals and stability of therapeutic proteins. These functions, structure, composition, linkages, biosynthesis, significance and biological effects are discussed as related to their use as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of diabetes mellitus and its complications. CONCLUSIONS: The findings revealed several chemical and natural compounds have significant beneficial effects on glycoprotein metabolism. The comprehension of glycoprotein structure and functions are very essential and inevitable to enhance the knowledge of glycoengineering for glycoprotein-based therapeutics as may be required for the treatment of diabetes mellitus and its associated complications. [Figure: see text]", " An Amyand's hernia is defined by the presence of a vermiform appendix within an inguinal hernia sac. Most of these cases are not diagnosed preoperatively and the surgical approach is dependent on the type present and associated intraoperative findings. We present a case of a preoperatively diagnosed Amyand's hernia in a man who underwent treatment by simultaneous laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal repair and laparoscopic appendectomy. CASE PRESENTATION We encountered the case of a 76-year-old Japanese man with a right inguinal pain. Ultrasound and computed tomography confirmed his vermiform appendix herniated into the right inguinal canal. We managed a simultaneous laparoscopic total extraperitoneal inguinal hernia repair with mesh and laparoscopic appendectomy. He was discharged without any postoperative morbidity. CONCLUSIONS We recommend laparoscopic appendectomy and totally extraperitoneal hernia repair with mesh after laparoscopic reduction for Amyand's hernia.", " AND PURPOSE Endovascular therapy with liquid embolic agents is a common treatment strategy for cranial dural arteriovenous fistulas. This study evaluated the long-term effectiveness of transarterial Onyx as the single embolic agent for curative embolization of noncavernous cranial dural arteriovenous fistulas. MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed a retrospective review of 40 consecutive patients with 41 cranial dural arteriovenous fistulas treated between March 2006 and June 2012 by using transarterial Onyx embolization with intent to cure. The mean age was 57 years; one-third presented with intracranial hemorrhage. Most (85%) had cortical venous drainage. Once angiographic cure was achieved, long-term treatment effectiveness was assessed with DSA and clinical follow-up. RESULTS Forty-nine embolization sessions were performed; 85% of cranial dural arteriovenous fistulas were treated in a single session. The immediate angiographic cure rate was 95%. The permanent neurologic complication rate was 2% (mild facial palsy). Thirty-five of the 38 patients with initial cure underwent short-term follow-up DSA (median, 4 months). The short-term recurrence rate was only 6% (2/35). All patients with occlusion at short-term DSA undergoing long-term DSA (median, 28 months) had durable occlusion. No patient with long-term clinical follow-up (total, 117 patient-years; median, 45 months) experienced hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS Transarterial embolization with Onyx as the single embolic agent results in durable long-term cure of noncavernous cranial dural arteriovenous fistulas. Recurrence rates are low on short-term follow-up, and all patients with angiographic occlusion on short-term DSA follow-up have experienced a durable long-term cure. Thus, angiographic cure should be defined at short-term follow-up angiography instead of at the end of the final embolization session. Finally, long-term DSA follow-up may not be necessary if occlusion is demonstrated on short-term angiographic follow-up.", "PURPOSE To evaluate the effectiveness of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) using Sonazoid for the diagnosis of the local recurrence after treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by comparing it with dynamic CT. METHODS Seventy-one patients with 87 HCC lesions (mean +/- SD; 19.5 +/- 9.6 mm) underwent CEUS using Sonazoid and dynamic CT after radiofrequency ablation (n = 55), transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (n = 22), or radiofrequency ablation combined with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (n = 10). Two hepatologists (observer 1; 10 years of experience, and 2; 20 years of experience) reviewed the CEUS and dynamic CT images independently and evaluated presence or absence of the local recurrence. Diagnostic performance for the local recurrence was assessed using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. RESULTS The Az value for dynamic CT was significantly lower in observer 1 than 2 (p < 0.05). The sensitivity of CEUS was 79% in observer 1 and 83.9% in observer 2, and that of dynamic CT was 83.9% and 90.3%, respectively. The specificity of CEUS was 96%, and that of dynamic CT was 92%, in both observers. CONCLUSION This study suggests that CEUS using Sonazoid is less affected by the observer's experience and is more accurate in the diagnosis of local recurrence after treatment for HCC than dynamic CT.", "PURPOSE Acute basilar artery occlusion is associated with high rates of major morbidity and mortality. In rare cases, the underlying pathology is a high-grade stenosis of the basilar artery. We report on a series of seven cases with occluded high-grade basilar artery stenosis who received endovascular therapy at our center. MATERIAL AND METHODS Our prospective database since October 2009 until September 2013 was screened for patients with acute basilar artery occlusion and underlying high-grade stenosis who underwent endovascular therapy. Case files were retrospectively reviewed for clinical, outcome, and technical data. RESULTS Seven patients were identified who suffered from an acute basilar artery occlusion based on a high-grade stenosis between October 2009 and September 2013. These patients were treated with an acute stenting of the basilar artery with or without a preceding mechanical thrombectomy. Median age was 75 (53-83) years; median prethrombectomy National Institute of Health Stroke scale score was 19 (7-28). A successful recanalization result defined as modified Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction grade 2b or higher was achieved in all cases. Two of the seven patients had a procedural complication consisting of a vessel dissection after angioplasty. A good clinical outcome according to the Solitaire flow restoration device versus the Merci Retriever in patients with acute ischaemic stroke (SWIFT) study criteria was achieved in three of the seven patients. One patient died during hospitalization in the acute phase. CONCLUSION Mechanical thrombectomy combined with acute stenting of the basilar artery is technically feasible and may be an effective therapeutic option in the rare case of an acutely occluded high-grade stenosis of the basilar artery in patients with an otherwise poor prognosis.", "PURPOSE The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of microwave (MW) ablation of liver metastases guided by B-mode ultrasound (US) and contrast-enhanced US (CEUS). MATERIALS AND METHODS 39 patients (17 women and 22 men) with a total of 125 liver metastases were treated with percutaneous or intraoperative CEUS-guided MW ablation. The primary tumor was colorectal cancer (n = 31), breast cancer (n = 6), carcinoid tumor (n = 1), and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) (n = 1). The median number of metastases ablated in the 45 treatment sessions was 2 (range 1 - 11). The median size (maximum diameter) of the 125 metastases was 1.5 cm (range, 0.6 - 4.0 cm). Nineteen (15 %) of the 125 metastases were bigger than 2 cm. Metastases smaller than 2 cm were treated with a single needle, metastases bigger than 2 cm were treated with 2 or 3 parallel needles. RESULTS The 45 MW ablation sessions were performed percutaneously (n = 30), during laparotomy (n = 3), or during laparotomy combined with liver resection (n = 12). The 39 patients were followed up for at least 4 months with a median duration of 11 months (range, 4 - 20 months). The technical success rate was 100 %. The clinical effectiveness was 100 % with complete coverage of the metastasis by the avascular coagulation zone evaluated on immediate post-ablation CEUS. Local tumor progression (local recurrence) was seen in 12 (9.6 %) of the 125 treated metastases, and affected 10 (26 %) of the 39 patients. One major complication was observed in the form of a liver abscess that easily resolved after percutaneous drainage. Four minor complications were observed: Three cases of pain located at the puncture site and one case of ascites. CEUS was valuable in all phases of ablation including pre-ablation staging and procedure planning, placement of MW needles in the tumor, immediate post-ablation control of coagulation size, and finally in the long term follow-up regime. CONCLUSION CEUS-guided MW ablation of liver metastases is an efficient and safe ablation technique with several advantages compared to other ablation modalities.", "Recombinant adenoviruses are being developed for gene therapy for cystic fibrosis and other lung diseases, and for prevention and treatment of vascular thrombosis. A major limitation to the clinical utility of adenoviruses is the low efficiency of gene transfer achieved in vivo. In addition, little is known about the initial interactions between adenoviruses and the target cell. To address the hypothesis that the negative charge presented by membrane glycoproteins reduces the efficiency of adenovirus-mediated gene transfer, primary cultures of human airway, Madin\u2013Darby canine kidney cells, an immortalized cystic fibrosis airway epithelial cell line, and primary cultures of sheep pulmonary artery endothelium were infected with recombinant adeno- virus containing the E. coli lacZ reporter gene (Ad2\u03b2gal2) in the presence of various polyions. For each cell type, adsorption of Ad2\u03b2gal2 in the presence of the polycations polybrene, protamine, DEAE-dextran, and poly-L-lysine significantly increased the percentage of cells that express lacZ. The polyanion heparin did not significantly alter gene transfer efficiency, but completely abrogated the effects of polycations. These data provide evidence that negatively charged moieties on the cell surface reduce the efficiency of adenovirus-mediated gene transfer, and that alteration of the charge interaction between adenoviruses and the cell surface may improve the potential clinical application of these vectors.", "Lambda interferon (IFN-\u03bb) has potent antiviral effects against multiple enteric viral pathogens, including norovirus and rotavirus, in both preventing and curing infection. Because the intestine includes a diverse array of cell types, however, the cell(s) upon which IFN-\u03bb acts to exert its antiviral effects is unclear. Here, we sought to identify IFN-\u03bb-responsive cells by generation of mice with lineage-specific deletion of the receptor for IFN-\u03bb, Ifnlr1 We found that expression of IFNLR1 on intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) in the small intestine and colon is required for enteric IFN-\u03bb antiviral activity. IEC Ifnlr1 expression also determines the efficacy of IFN-\u03bb in resolving persistent murine norovirus (MNoV) infection and regulates fecal shedding and viral titers in tissue. Thus, the expression of Ifnlr1 by IECs is necessary for the response to both endogenous and exogenous IFN-\u03bb. We further demonstrate that IEC Ifnlr1 expression is required for the sterilizing innate immune effects of IFN-\u03bb by extending these findings in Rag1-deficient mice. Finally, we assessed whether our findings pertained to multiple viral pathogens by infecting mice specifically lacking IEC Ifnlr1 expression with reovirus. These mice phenocopied Ifnlr1-null animals, exhibiting increased intestinal tissue titers and enhanced reovirus fecal shedding. Thus, IECs are the critical cell type responding to IFN-\u03bb to control multiple enteric viruses. This is the first genetic evidence that supports an essential role for IECs in IFN-\u03bb-mediated control of enteric viral infection, and these findings provide insight into the mechanism of IFN-\u03bb-mediated antiviral activity.IMPORTANCE Human noroviruses (HNoVs) are the leading cause of epidemic gastroenteritis worldwide. Type III interferons (IFN-\u03bb) control enteric viral infections in the gut and have been shown to cure mouse norovirus, a small-animal model for HNoVs. Using a genetic approach with conditional knockout mice, we identified IECs as the dominant IFN-\u03bb-responsive cells in control of enteric virus infection in vivo Upon murine norovirus or reovirus infection, Ifnlr1 depletion in IECs largely recapitulated the phenotype seen in Ifnlr1-/- mice of higher intestinal tissue viral titers and increased viral shedding in the stool. Moreover, IFN-\u03bb-mediated sterilizing immunity against murine norovirus requires the capacity of IECs to respond to IFN-\u03bb. These findings clarify the mechanism of action of this cytokine and emphasize the therapeutic potential of IFN-\u03bb for treating mucosal viral infections.", " Although flow diverters (FDs) have been widely accepted by neurointerventionists, their safety has yet to be fully defined. Stratification by aneurysm size and location is essential for correct evaluation of treatment outcomes and risks of flow diversion. OBJECTIVE To compare neurological and anatomic outcomes and evaluate the risk of complications after endovascular treatment of large or giant internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysms with FD/FDs alone or together with coil embolization. METHODS We reviewed all patients with large or giant, ruptured or unruptured ICA aneurysms who underwent endovascular treatment with flow diversion alone (group A) or with concomitant coiling (group B) in 4 international institutions between 2010 and 2015. Anatomic outcome was evaluated using the Byrne scale on digital subtraction angiography and/or angioMRI and/or angioCT scans 3, 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. RESULTS We collected 44 patients with large or giant ICA aneurysms. Four patients (9%) presented with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). FD/FDs were used alone in 26 patients and in combination with coil embolization in the 18 remaining patients. The mortality rate due to procedure-related and/or neurological complications was 2.2%. Twelve months after the procedure, 88.6% (n = 39) of patients had a favorable neurological outcome. One year after the procedure, the aneurysm was completely occluded in 72.7% of patients: 61.5% (16/18) in group A and 88.9% (16/26) in group B. CONCLUSION Clinical outcomes and rates of intraoperative and postoperative complications did not differ significantly between the groups. Better anatomic results using FD/FDs combined with coils were documented 6 months after the procedure; this option seems to provide a higher aneurysm occlusion rate and reduce the need for retreatment.", "PURPOSE To examine the accuracy of the unenhanced zone at contrast material-enhanced ultrasonography (US) in predicting coagulative necrosis during and 21 days after radiofrequency (RF) ablation by using radiologic-pathologic comparison. MATERIALS AND METHODS Animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The livers of 28 rats underwent US-guided RF ablation. In four animals, contrast-enhanced US was performed during ablation and 2 hours and 2, 7, 14, and 21 days after ablation. The unenhanced zone area on US images was measured. DiI-labeled microbubbles were administered during ablation at 2, 4, and 6 minutes or at 2 hours and 2, 7, 14, and 21 days after ablation in the remaining 24 animals (n = 3 at each time point). One minute later, the animal was euthanized, and the ablated liver was harvested. Tissue samples were imaged to quantify total fluorescence, and NADH staining was performed on the same slice. Hematoxylin-eosin staining was also performed. The findings on fluorescence images, NADH-stained images, and hematoxylin-eosin-stained images were compared. The areas of DiI bubble-negative zones, NADH-negative zones, and lightly NADH-staining zones were measured. Data were analyzed by using one-way analysis of variance. RESULTS The area of the unenhanced zone on contrast-enhanced US images increased during RF ablation and reached a maximum within 2 days after ablation. At histopathologic examination, a transition zone manifested adjacent to the coagulation zone until 2 days after ablation. The DiI-bubble negative zone on fluorescence images and the damaged zone (transition zone plus coagulation zone) on NADH-stained images increased rapidly within 2 hours after ablation, then slowly reached the maximum on day 2. The ratios of the mean areas of these two zones at hour 2 to those at day 2 were 94.6% and 95.6%, respectively. High uniformity between the damaged zone on NADH-stained images and the DiI bubble-negative zone on fluorescence images was noted at all time points. CONCLUSION The temporary transition zone in NADH staining is partially damaged and should transition to nonviability 2 days after ablation. These results demonstrate that contrast-enhanced US can help delineate the maximum area of cell damage (to within 5% of the maximum) as early as 2 hours after ablation. Contrast-enhanced US may be a simple and accurate tool for monitoring the effects of RF ablation and quantifying the size of thermal damage after treatment.", " Atherosclerosis in the superficial femoral artery is common in patients suffering from peripheral artery disease. Paclitaxel-eluting balloon (PEB) angioplasty, stenting, and directional atherectomy (DA) have provided new options for the treatment of superficial femoral artery disease; however, the comparative efficacy of these interventional strategies remains uncertain. METHODS One hundred and fifty-five patients with symptomatic peripheral artery disease due to de novo superficial femoral artery stenotic or occlusive lesions were randomized to treatment with plain balloon angioplasty (BA) followed by PEB angioplasty and stenting (n=48), BA and stenting (n=52), or DA with distal protection and bailout stenting (n=55). The primary end point of the study was percentage diameter stenosis after 6 months measured by angiography. Other end points included target lesion revascularization, thrombosis, ipsilateral amputation, binary restenosis, and all-cause mortality at 6 and 24 months. RESULTS Baseline and lesion characteristics were comparable in all groups with a mean lesion length of 65.9\u00b146.8 mm and 56% total occlusions. At 6 months angiography, the percent diameter stenosis was significantly lower in patients treated by PEB angioplasty and stenting (34\u00b131%) as compared with BA angioplasty and stenting (56\u00b129%, P=0.009) or DA (55\u00b129%, P=0.007). Similarly, binary restenosis was significantly lower after treatment with PEB and stenting as compared with BA and stenting or DA. Clinical follow-up at 24 months revealed a lower risk for target lesion revascularization after PEB angioplasty and stenting as compared with BA and stenting or DA. We found no difference in terms of target lesion thrombosis and mortality among groups, and no patient underwent amputation. CONCLUSIONS Treatment of de novo superficial femoral artery lesions with PEB angioplasty and stenting is superior to BA angioplasty and stenting or DA in terms of angiographic diameter stenosis at 6 months and target lesion revascularization at 24 months. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Unique identifier: NCT00986752.", " Symptomatic slow-acting drugs for osteoarthritis (SYSADOAs) are an important drug class in the treatment armamentarium for osteoarthritis (OA). OBJECTIVE We aimed to re-assess the safety of various SYSADOAs in a comprehensive meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials, using, as much as possible, data from full safety reports. METHODS We performed a systematic review and random-effects meta-analyses of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials that assessed adverse events (AEs) with various SYSADOAs in patients with OA. The databases MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Ovid CENTRAL) and Scopus were searched. The primary outcomes were overall severe and serious AEs, as well as AEs involving the following Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) system organ classes (SOCs): gastrointestinal, cardiac, vascular, nervous system, skin and subcutaneous tissue, musculoskeletal and connective tissue, renal and urinary system. RESULTS Database searches initially identified 3815 records. After exclusions according to the selection criteria, 25 studies on various SYSADOAs were included in the qualitative synthesis, and 13 studies with adequate data were included in the meta-analyses. Next, from the studies previously excluded according to the protocol, 37 with mainly oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) permitted as concomitant medication were included in a parallel qualitative synthesis, from which 18 studies on various SYSADOAs were included in parallel meta-analyses. This post hoc parallel inclusion was conducted because of the high number of studies allowing concomitant anti-OA medications. Indeed, primarily excluding studies with concomitant anti-OA medications was crucial for a meta-analysis on safety. The decision for parallel inclusion was made for the purpose of comparative analyses. Glucosamine sulfate (GS), chondroitin sulfate (CS) and avocado soybean unsaponifiables (ASU; Piascledine\u00ae) were not associated with increased odds for any type of AEs compared with placebo. Overall, with/without concomitant OA medication, diacerein was associated with significantly increased odds of total AEs (odds ratio [OR] 2.22; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.58-3.13; I2 = 52.8%), gastrointestinal disorders (OR 2.85; 95% CI 2.02-4.04; I2 = 62.8%) and renal and urinary disorders (OR 3.42; 95% CI 2.36-4.96; I2 = 17.0%) compared with placebo. In studies that allowed concomitant OA medications, diacerein was associated with significantly more dermatological disorders (OR 2.47; 95% CI 1.42-4.31; I2 = 0%) and more dropouts due to AEs (OR 3.18; 95% CI 1.85-5.47; I2 = 13.4%) than was placebo. No significant increase in serious or severe AEs was found with diacerein versus placebo. CONCLUSIONS GS and CS can be considered safe treatments for patients with OA. All eligible studies on ASU included in our analysis used the proprietary product Piascledine\u00ae and allowed other anti-OA medications; thus, the safety of ASU must be confirmed in future studies without concomitant anti-OA medications. Given the safety concerns with diacerein, its usefulness in patients with OA should be assessed, taking into account individual patient characteristics.", "Obesity is one of the key noncommunicable diseases leading to significant comorbidities. In recent years, obesity has become a major public health issue and has threatened the wellbeing of millions of patients. Although there are multiple reasons for people becoming obese, sustained positive energy balance - energy intake is greater than energy expenditure - is the key for accumulating excess bodyfat. Prevention of obesity by lifestyle changes, healthy eating and increased physical activity are more cost effective than pharmacotherapy, bariatric surgery or ultimately treating complications of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Not all patients with obesity experience complications such as T2DM. The distribution of bodyfat is important in determining whether a person is obese and healthy or needs medical attention; however, the use of BMI alone will not differentiate this. Obesity patients with excess abdominal fat have the highest risk for T2DM, insulin resistance and thus, higher incidence of cardiovascular diseases. Obesity-associated complications can be reversed through healthy eating habits and increased duration and intensity of physical activity. Increasing work- and leisure-related physical activities increase the energy expenditure, having salutary effects on weightloss programs. Although treating symptoms of obesity and related disorders is important, it is not a solution for the obesity epidemic. Causes that lead to weight-gain need to be identified in individual patients, who should be educated about the causes of weight gain and ways to prevent it, and be provided with simple and practical interventions to lose weight.", "We report a rare case of a laparoscopic splenectomy performed for a carcinoid metastasis. The patient represented with pleuritic left-sided chest pain from pleural deposits 9 years following resection of a primary lung carcinoid tumour. They were found to have a 4.7 cm splenic lesion on CT with a probable left acetabular metastasis demonstrated on Gallium PET scan. The patient underwent laparoscopic splenectomy for debulking treatment of the splenic lesion that was confirmed to be a splenic metastasis of the resected carcinoid lung tumour. Following an uncomplicated recovery, the patient was discharged on the second postoperative day. On discharge, she received adjuvant therapy with Lutetium 177 DOTATATE. This is the first report of a carcinoid splenic metastasis successfully treated with laparoscopic splenectomy.", "Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a syndrome of excessive immune system activation driven mainly by high levels of interferon gamma. The clinical presentation of HLH can have considerable overlap with other inflammatory conditions. We present a cohort of patients with therapy refractory HLH referred to our center who were found to have a simultaneous presentation of complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). Twenty-three patients had therapy refractory HLH (13 primary, 4 EVB-HLH, 6 HLH without known trigger). Sixteen (69.6%) met high-risk TMA criteria. Renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy, severe hypertension, serositis, and gastrointestinal bleeding were documented only in patients with HLH who had concomitant complement-mediated TMA. Patients with HLH and without TMA required ventilator support mainly due to CNS symptoms, while those with HLH and TMA had respiratory failure predominantly associated with pulmonary hypertension, a known presentation of pulmonary TMA. Ten patients received eculizumab for complement-mediated TMA management while being treated for HLH. All patients who received the complement blocker eculizumab in addition to the interferon gamma blocker emapalumab had complete resolution of their TMA and survived. Our observations suggest co-activation of both interferon and complement pathways as a potential culprit in the evolution of thrombotic microangiopathy in patients with inflammatory disorders like refractory HLH and may offer novel therapeutic approaches for these critically ill patients. TMA should be considered in children with HLH and multi-organ failure, as an early institution of a brief course of complement blocking therapy in addition to HLH-targeted therapy may improve clinical outcomes in these patients. ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL: The online version of this article (10.1007/s10875-020-00789-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.", "PURPOSE Acute major stroke with high-grade stenosis or occlusion of the extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) and additional intracranial large artery occlusion is increasingly treated with a mechanical endovascular approach by extracranial stenting and intracranial thrombectomy due to poor response to systemic thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA). This article presents a single centre cohort of this challenging subtype of stroke, describing the technical procedure and analysing the angiographic and clinical outcome. METHODS Clinical and imaging data of all consecutive patients between July 2008 and March 2013 with intracranial artery occlusion in the anterior circulation and additional occlusion or pseudo-occlusion of the cervical ICA were retrospectively analysed with respect to demographical and clinical characteristics. Technical approach, recanalization rate, recanalization time and short-term clinical outcome were determined. RESULTS A total of 43 patients with tandem occlusion in the anterior circulation met the inclusion criteria. Out of these, 32 (74.4%) occlusions and 11 (25.6%) pseudo-occlusions of the extracranial ICA with additional occlusion of the distal segment of the ICA in 7.0% (3/43), the M1-segment of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) in 81.4% (35/43) or the M2-segment of the MCA in 11.6% (5/43) of cases were treated with combined endovascular approach including extracranial stenting with angioplasty and intracranial mechanical thrombectomy. In 76.7% of cases, an angiographic recanalization result of 2b or 3 using the Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) score was achieved. Mean time from first angiographic series to recanalization was 103 min. A modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of \u2264 2 was achieved in 32.6% at the time of discharge. CONCLUSION Endovascular therapy of patients with tandem occlusion in the anterior circulation with emergency extracranial stenting and intracranial mechanical thrombectomy appears to be safe and may lead to a satisfactory angiographic result and clinical outcome.", "Fiberoptic bronchoscopy is a valuable diagnostic tool in solid-organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients presenting with a range of pulmonary complications. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the utility and potential adverse effects of diagnostic bronchoscopy for transplant recipients. Recommendations are offered on the selection of patients, the timing of bronchoscopy, and the samples to be obtained across the spectrum of suspected pulmonary complications of transplantation. Based on review of the literature, the authors recommend early diagnostic bronchoscopy over empiric treatment in transplant recipients with evidence of certain acute, subacute, or chronic pulmonary processes. This approach may be most critical when an underlying infectious etiology is suspected. In the absence of prompt diagnostic information on which to base effective treatment, the risks associated with empiric antimicrobial therapy, including medication side effects and the development of antibiotic resistance, compound the potential harm of delaying targeted management.", "OBJECTIVE To determine whether the course of COVID-19 is more severe in patients with MS and if MS disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) affect the risk of contracting the disease. METHODS In a cross-sectional survey, data were collected by sending a questionnaire to 2000 patients with a demyelinating disease through an online portal system. Collected data included the current MS DMT and patient-reported disability level, history of recent sick contact, recent fever, respiratory symptoms, diagnosis with COVID-19, and the disposition after the diagnosis. We defined a COVID-19-suspect group as patients having fever and cough or fever and shortness of breath, or a presumptive diagnosis based on suggestive chest computed tomography. We calculated the proportion of COVID-19-suspect patients and compared their demographics, clinical characteristics, and DMT categories with the rest of survey-responders, using univariable and multivariable models. RESULTS Out of 712 patients, 34 (4.8%) fulfilled our criteria for being in the COVID-19-suspect group. Only two patients required hospitalization. No patient required intensive care. In a multivariable model, disease duration (p-value=0.017), DMT category (p-value=0.030), and history of sick contact (p-values<0.001) were associated with the risk of being in the COVID-19-suspect group. Being on B-cell depleting antibodies (as compared to non-cell depleting, non-cell trafficking inhibitor DMTs) was associated with a 2.6-fold increase in the risk of being in the COVID-19-suspect group. (RR: 3.55, 95%CI: 1.45, 8.68, p-value=0.005). CONCLUSIONS The course of infection in patients with MS suspected of having COVID-19 was mild to moderate, and all patients had a full recovery. B-cell depleting antibodies may increase the susceptibility to contracting COVID-19.", "Marburg virus (MARV) and Ebola virus (EBOV), members of the family Filoviridae, represent a significant challenge to global public health. Currently, no licensed therapies exist to treat filovirus infections, which cause up to 90% mortality in human cases. To facilitate development of antivirals against these viruses, we established two distinct screening platforms based on MARV and EBOV reverse genetics systems that express secreted Gaussia luciferase (gLuc). The first platform is a mini-genome replicon to screen viral replication inhibitors using gLuc quantification in a BSL-2 setting. The second platform is complementary to the first and expresses gLuc as a reporter gene product encoded in recombinant infectious MARV and EBOV, thereby allowing for rapid quantification of viral growth during treatment with antiviral compounds. We characterized these viruses by comparing luciferase activity to virus production, and validated luciferase activity as an authentic real-time measure of viral growth. As proof of concept, we adapt both mini-genome and infectious virus platforms to high-throughput formats, and demonstrate efficacy of several antiviral compounds. We anticipate that both approaches will prove highly useful in the development of anti-filovirus therapies, as well as in basic research on the filovirus life cycle.", "Although transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement is the standard procedure for the treatment of portal hypertension, it is often impossible to perform in patients with extrahepatic portal vein occlusion. In these patients, options for decompressing the liver are few. In this report, we present a novel solution for managing gastro-esophageal hemorrhage in a child with portal hypertension and extrahepatic portal vein occlusion, through the creation of a percutaneous mesocaval shunt.", "AIMS This was a pilot study assessing the impact of a sensory adapted dental environment (SADE) on children with developmental disabilities (DD) receiving routine dental care. METHODS A crossover study of 22 children with DD, aged 6 through 21, was conducted at a University Pediatric Dental clinic. Each participant was randomized to a sequence of two dental cleanings on a 3- to 4-month recall schedule, one with a regular dental environment (RDE) and one with SADE. Outcomes included physiological measures (heart rate and oxygen saturation) and cooperation (Frankl scores). RESULTS Study subjects completed 36 visits. None of the physiological measures differed at either time point between the two treatment settings. The Frankl scores were significantly higher with SADE setting than RDE (P = 0.0368). Forty-six percent of parents strongly agreed that they would prefer the SADE for their child's next visit. CONCLUSION SADE may be associated with improved behavior in children with DD.", "PURPOSE To describe the use of Embozene microspheres as an alternative treatment for intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVF). CASE REPORT The DAVF was located close to the vertex and mainly fed by the left medial meningeal artery (MMA). Embolization was performed using Embozene microspheres due to stenosis in the posterior branch of the left MMA and a conglomerate of tortuous courses in the anterior branch. Complete occlusion was achieved without complication. Neurological symptoms improved, and the patient remained asymptomatic during 1-year follow-up. Angiography at 1 year did not reveal any revascularization. CONCLUSION Use of microspheres may be a safe and effective alternative treatment, particularly in patients with impeded access to the DAVF.", " AND PURPOSE To assess whether the combined analysis of all phase III trials of nonvitamin-K-antagonist (non-VKA) oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation and previous stroke or transient ischemic attack shows a significant difference in efficacy or safety compared with warfarin. METHODS We searched PubMed until May 31, 2012, for randomized clinical trials using the following search items: atrial fibrillation, anticoagulation, warfarin, and previous stroke or transient ischemic attack. Studies had to be phase III trials in atrial fibrillation patients comparing warfarin with a non-VKA currently on the market or with the intention to be brought to the market in North America or Europe. Analysis was performed on intention-to-treat basis. A fixed-effects model was used as more appropriate than a random-effects model when combining a small number of studies. RESULTS Among 47 potentially eligible articles, 3 were included in the meta-analysis. In 14 527 patients, non-VKAs were associated with a significant reduction of stroke/systemic embolism (odds ratios, 0.85 [95% CI, 074-0.99]; relative risk reduction, 14%; absolute risk reduction, 0.7%; number needed to treat, 134 over 1.8-2.0 years) compared with warfarin. Non-VKAs were also associated with a significant reduction of major bleeding compared with warfarin (odds ratios, 0.86 [95% CI, 075-0.99]; relative risk reduction, 13%; absolute risk reduction, 0.8%; number needed to treat, 125), mainly driven by the significant reduction of hemorrhagic stroke (odds ratios, 0.44 [95% CI, 032-0.62]; relative risk reduction, 57.9%; absolute risk reduction, 0.7%; number needed to treat, 139). CONCLUSIONS In the context of the significant limitations of combining the results of disparate trials of different agents, non-VKAs seem to be associated with a significant reduction in rates of stroke or systemic embolism, hemorrhagic stroke, and major bleeding when compared with warfarin in patients with previous stroke or transient ischemic attack.", "Background and purpose In patients with acute ischemic stroke who receive antiplatelet treatment, uncertainty exists about the effect and safety of intra-arterial treatment. Our aim was to study whether intra-arterial treatment in patients with prior antiplatelet treatment is safe and whether prior antiplatelet treatment modifies treatment effect. Methods All 500 MR CLEAN patients were included. We estimated the effect of intra-arterial treatment with ordinal logistic regression analysis, and tested for interaction of antiplatelet treatment with intra-arterial treatment on outcome. Furthermore, safety parameters and serious adverse events were analyzed. Results The 144 patients (29%) on antiplatelet treatment were older, more often male, and had more vascular comorbidity. Intra-arterial treatment effect size after adjustments in antiplatelet treatment patients was 1.7 (95% confidence interval 0.9-3.2), and in no antiplatelet treatment patients 1.8 (95% confidence interval: 1.2-2.6). There was no statistically or clinically significant interaction between prior antiplatelet treatment and the relative effect of intra-arterial treatment ( p = 0.78). However, in patients on antiplatelet treatment, the effect of successful reperfusion on functional outcome in the intervention arm of the trial was doubled: the absolute risk difference for favorable outcome after successful reperfusion in patients on prior antiplatelet treatment was 39% versus 18% in patients not on prior antiplatelet treatment (Pinteraction = 0.025). Patients on antiplatelet treatment more frequently had a symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (15%) compared to patients without antiplatelet treatment (4%), without differences between the control and intervention arm. Conclusions Prior treatment with antiplatelet agents did not modify the effect of intra-arterial treatment in patients with acute ischemic stroke presenting with an intracranial large vessel occlusion. There were no safety concerns. In patients with reperfusion, antiplatelet agents may improve functional outcome.", "Corticosteroid use has been implicated in the development of osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH). The exact mechanism and predisposing factors such as age, gender, dosage, type and combination of steroid treatment remain controversial. Between March and July 2003, a total of 539 patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) were treated with five different types of steroid. There were 129 men (24%) and 410 women (76%) with a mean age of 33.7 years (21 to 59). Routine screening was undertaken with radiographs, MRI and/or CT to determine the incidence of ONFH. Of the 129 male patients with SARS, 51 (39.5%) were diagnosed as suffering from ONFH, compared with only 79 of 410 female patients (19.3%). The incidence of ONFH in the patients aged between 20 and 49 years was much higher than that of the group aged between 50 and 59 years (25.9% (127 of 491) versus 6.3% (3 of 48); p = 0.018). The incidence of ONFH in patients receiving one type of steroid was 12.5% (21 of 168), which was much lower than patients receiving two different types (28.6%; 96 of 336) or three different types of steroid (37.1%; 13 of 35).", " AND PURPOSE To assess whether the combined analysis of all phase III trials of nonvitamin-K-antagonist (non-VKA) oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation and previous stroke or transient ischemic attack shows a significant difference in efficacy or safety compared with warfarin.

METHODS We analyzed 319 patients (220 asymptomatic and 99 symptomatic) who underwent carotid angioplasty from 2002 until 2012 for CR that occurred after eversion endarterectomy. During this period, 7993 eversion endarterectomies were done for significant carotid artery stenosis. Significant CR was detected by ultrasound examination and confirmed by digital subtraction angiography or multidetector computed tomography angiography. After angioplasty (with or without stenting), color duplex ultrasound imaging was done after 1 month, 6 months, 1 year, and annually thereafter. End points encompassed myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death (fatal myocardial infarction, fatal cardiac failure, fatal stroke), and also puncture site hematoma and recurrent restenosis. Primary end points were analyzed as early results (\u226430 days after the procedure), and secondary end points were long-term results (>30 days). Variables and risk factors influencing the early-term and long-term results were also analyzed. Median follow-up was 49.8 \u00b1 22.8 months (range, 17-121 months). RESULTS All but one procedure ended with a technical success (99.7%). In the early postoperative period, transient ischemic attack occurred in 2.8% of the patients and stroke in 1.6%, followed by one lethal outcome (0.3%). Stent thrombosis occurred in one patient (0.3%) several hours after the angioplasty, followed by urgent surgery and graft interposition. In the long-term follow-up, there were no transient ischemic attacks or strokes, non-neurologic mortality was 3.13%, and the recurrent restenosis rate was 4.4%. The rate of non-neurologic outcomes during the follow-up was significantly higher in asymptomatic patients than in symptomatic patients (4.54% vs 0%; P = .034). The statically highest rate of transient ischemic attack was verified in patients in whom Precise (Cordis Corporation, New Brunswick, NJ) stents was used (12.2%) and a Spider Fx (Covidien, Dublin, Ireland) cerebral protection device (12.5%) was used. Female gender, coronary artery disease, plaque calcifications, and smoking history were associated with an adverse outcome after angioplasty. CONCLUSIONS Carotid artery stenting is safe and reliable procedure for CR after eversion endarterectomy treatment, with low rate of postprocedural complications. Type of stent and cerebral embolic protection device may influence the rate of postprocedural neurologic ischemic events.", "OBJECTIVE: To identify predictors of pulmonary fibrosis development by combining follow-up thin-section CT findings and clinical features in patients discharged after treatment for COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study involved 32 confirmed COVID-19 patients who were divided into two groups according to the evidence of fibrosis on their latest follow-up CT imaging. Clinical data and CT imaging features of all the patients in different stages were collected and analyzed for comparison. RESULTS: The latest follow-up CT imaging showed fibrosis in 14 patients (male, 12; female, 2) and no fibrosis in 18 patients (male, 10; female, 8). Compared with the non-fibrosis group, the fibrosis group was older (median age: 54.0 years vs. 37.0 years, p = 0.008), and the median levels of C-reactive protein (53.4 mg/L vs. 10.0 mg/L, p = 0.002) and interleukin-6 (79.7 pg/L vs. 11.2 pg/L, p = 0.04) were also higher. The fibrosis group had a longer-term of hospitalization (19.5 days vs. 10.0 days, p = 0.001), pulsed steroid therapy (11.0 days vs. 5.0 days, p < 0.001), and antiviral therapy (12.0 days vs. 6.5 days, p = 0.012). More patients on the worst-state CT scan had an irregular interface (59.4% vs. 34.4%, p = 0.045) and a parenchymal band (71.9% vs. 28.1%, p < 0.001). On initial CT imaging, the irregular interface (57.1%) and parenchymal band (50.0%) were more common in the fibrosis group. On the worst-state CT imaging, interstitial thickening (78.6%), air bronchogram (57.1%), irregular interface (85.7%), coarse reticular pattern (28.6%), parenchymal band (92.9%), and pleural effusion (42.9%) were more common in the fibrosis group. CONCLUSION: Fibrosis was more likely to develop in patients with severe clinical conditions, especially in patients with high inflammatory indicators. Interstitial thickening, irregular interface, coarse reticular pattern, and parenchymal band manifested in the process of the disease may be predictors of pulmonary fibrosis. Irregular interface and parenchymal band could predict the formation of pulmonary fibrosis early.", "Curative endovascular treatment of sphenoid wing dural arteriovenous fistula (dAVF) with pure cortical venous drainage is challenging because of its rarity, lack of accessible dural sinus for transvenous embolization (TVE), and proximity of skull base vital regions. Direct surgery to disconnect venous reflux has been favored. We report the curative endovascular treatment of two sphenoid wing dAVFs with pure cortical venous drainage. One patient revealed complete obliteration of dAVF by a single session of transarterial embolization (TAE). As part of strategic TAE for this complex dAVF, we used a novel approach to create a complete flow-arrest condition in which coils and an occlusion balloon were combined. A liquid agent was then injected across the pathological fistula and into the parent venous apparatus, thereby occluding the lesion. The other patient was treated with percutaneous TVE after TAE was unsuccessful. With a specific strategy and appropriate devices, the microcatheter was successfully introduced through sigmoid sinus, transverse sinus, superior sagittal sinus, and refluxing cortical vein by puncture of the jugular vein. Coils were deployed at the venous side of the fistula, resulting in successful obliteration of the dAVF. Sphenoid wing dAVF with pure cortical venous drainage could be curable by endovascular treatment with proper strategy and instruments when anatomical condition permits.", "Lambda interferon (IFN-\u03bb) has potent antiviral effects against multiple enteric viral pathogens, including norovirus and rotavirus, in both preventing and curing infection. Because the intestine includes a diverse array of cell types, however, the cell(s) upon which IFN-\u03bb acts to exert its antiviral effects is unclear. Here, we sought to identify IFN-\u03bb-responsive cells by generation of mice with lineage-specific deletion of the receptor for IFN-\u03bb, Ifnlr1 We found that expression of IFNLR1 on intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) in the small intestine and colon is required for enteric IFN-\u03bb antiviral activity. IEC Ifnlr1 expression also determines the efficacy of IFN-\u03bb in resolving persistent murine norovirus (MNoV) infection and regulates fecal shedding and viral titers in tissue. Thus, the expression of Ifnlr1 by IECs is necessary for the response to both endogenous and exogenous IFN-\u03bb. We further demonstrate that IEC Ifnlr1 expression is required for the sterilizing innate immune effects of IFN-\u03bb by extending these findings in Rag1-deficient mice. Finally, we assessed whether our findings pertained to multiple viral pathogens by infecting mice specifically lacking IEC Ifnlr1 expression with reovirus. These mice phenocopied Ifnlr1-null animals, exhibiting increased intestinal tissue titers and enhanced reovirus fecal shedding. Thus, IECs are the critical cell type responding to IFN-\u03bb to control multiple enteric viruses. This is the first genetic evidence that supports an essential role for IECs in IFN-\u03bb-mediated control of enteric viral infection, and these findings provide insight into the mechanism of IFN-\u03bb-mediated antiviral activity.IMPORTANCE Human noroviruses (HNoVs) are the leading cause of epidemic gastroenteritis worldwide. Type III interferons (IFN-\u03bb) control enteric viral infections in the gut and have been shown to cure mouse norovirus, a small-animal model for HNoVs. Using a genetic approach with conditional knockout mice, we identified IECs as the dominant IFN-\u03bb-responsive cells in control of enteric virus infection in vivo Upon murine norovirus or reovirus infection, Ifnlr1 depletion in IECs largely recapitulated the phenotype seen in Ifnlr1-/- mice of higher intestinal tissue viral titers and increased viral shedding in the stool. Moreover, IFN-\u03bb-mediated sterilizing immunity against murine norovirus requires the capacity of IECs to respond to IFN-\u03bb. These findings clarify the mechanism of action of this cytokine and emphasize the therapeutic potential of IFN-\u03bb for treating mucosal viral infections.", " Functional status is a key patient-centric outcome, but there are little data on whether functional recovery post-stroke varies among hospitals. This study examined the distribution of functional status 3 months after stroke, determined whether these outcomes vary among hospitals, and identified hospital characteristics associated with better (or worse) functional outcomes. METHODS AND RESULTS Observational analysis of the AVAIL study (Adherence Evaluation After Ischemic Stroke-Longitudinal) included 2083 ischemic stroke patients enrolled from 82 US hospitals participating in Get With The Guidelines-Stroke and AVAIL. The primary outcome was dependence or death at 3 months (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score of 3-6). Secondary outcomes included functional dependence (mRS score of 3-5), disabled (mRS score of 2-5), and mRS evaluated as a continuous score. By 3 months post-discharge, 36.5% of patients were functionally dependent or dead. Rates of dependence or death varied widely by discharging hospitals (range: 0%-67%). After risk adjustment, patients had lower rates of 3-month dependence or death when treated at teaching hospitals (odds ratio, 0.72; 95% confidence interval, 0.54-0.96) and certified primary stroke centers (odds ratio, 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.53-0.91). In contrast, a composite measure of hospital-level adherence to acute stroke care performance metrics, stroke volume, and bed size was not associated with downstream patient functional status. Findings were robust across mRS end points and sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS One third of acute ischemic stroke patients were functionally dependent or dead 3 months postacute stroke; functional recovery rates varied considerably among hospitals, supporting the need to better determine which care processes can maximize functional outcomes.", ": Few observations exist with respect to the pro-coagulant profile of patients with COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Reports of thromboembolic complications are scarce but suggestive for a clinical relevance of the problem. OBJECTIVES: Prospective observational study aimed to characterize the coagulation profile of COVID-19 ARDS patients with standard and viscoelastic coagulation tests and to evaluate their changes after establishment of an aggressive thromboprophylaxis. METHODS: Sixteen patients with COVID-19 ARDS received a complete coagulation profile at the admission in the intensive care unit. Ten patients were followed in the subsequent 7 days, after increasing the dose of low molecular weight heparin, antithrombin levels correction, and clopidogrel in selected cases. RESULTS: At baseline, the patients showed a pro-coagulant profile characterized by an increased clot strength (CS, median 55 hPa, 95% interquartile range 35-63), platelet contribution to CS (PCS, 43 hPa; interquartile range 24-45), fibrinogen contribution to CS (FCS, 12 hPa; interquartile range 6-13.5) elevated D-dimer levels (5.5 \u00b5g/mL, interquartile range 2.5-6.5), and hyperfibrinogenemia (794 mg/dL, interquartile range 583-933). Fibrinogen levels were associated (R2 = .506, P = .003) with interleukin-6 values. After increasing the thromboprophylaxis, there was a significant (P = .001) time-related decrease of fibrinogen levels, D-dimers (P = .017), CS (P = .013), PCS (P = .035), and FCS (P = .038). CONCLUSION: The pro-coagulant pattern of these patients may justify the clinical reports of thromboembolic complications (pulmonary embolism) during the course of the disease. Further studies are needed to assess the best prophylaxis and treatment of this condition.", "Background This study aims to evaluate the results of late-onset type A aortic dissection following primary cardiac surgery and to compare the outcomes of patients with or without prior coronary artery bypass grafting. Methods Between January 2005 and December 2015, data of 32 patients (16 males, 16 females; mean age 58.1\u00b110.9 years; range, 45 to 73 years) who were diagnosed with acute type A aortic dissection and underwent repair with a history of previous cardiac surgery at our institution were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were divided into two groups as those with a history of prior coronary artery bypass grafting (n=16) and the patients with a previous cardiac surgery without prior coronary artery bypass grafting (n=16). Results Dissection of the ascending aorta occurred in 32 patients (late acute in 22 and late chronic in 10) who underwent previous cardiac surgery (aortic valve replacement in 12, mitral valve replacement in two, aortic valve replacement + coronary artery bypass grafting in two, coronary artery bypass grafting in 10, mitral valve replacement + coronary artery bypass grafting in four, and dual valve replacement in two patients). The mean time between the first operation and dissection was 4.0\u00b11.5 years. Dissections were treated with the Bentall procedures (n=8), ascending aorta replacement (n=14), ascending aorta replacement + hemiarch replacement (n=4), ascending aorta + aortic valve replacement (n=4) and Bentall + arch replacement (n=2). In-hospital mortality (30-day mortality) was seen in five patients, and oneyear mortality rate was 21.85% (n=7). The survival rates of the all patients for primary cardiac surgery vs primary cardiac surgery + coronary artery bypass grafting were 81.25% vs 75% at one year, 75% vs 68.75% at three years,75% vs 56.25% at five years, 68.75% vs 56.25% at seven years, and 68.75% vs 56.25% at 10 years, respectively (p=0.71, CI: 95%). Conclusion Type-A aortic dissections may develop after cardiac operations with or without coronary artery bypass grafting at any time, and irrespective of associated histologies, they may result in high overall in-hospital mortality. With careful planning by prompt intervention, the outcomes in redo sternotomy operations with or without coronary artery bypass grafting for aortic dissections would be consistent the results of spontaneous aortic dissections.", "PURPOSE Directional atherectomy (DA) was introduced for the management of infrainguinal arterial stenosis or occlusive lesions. The procedure success rate in the DEFINITIVE LE study was determined using radiologic imaging. The aim of our study was to determine the usefulness of intraoperative ultrasonography (USG) during DA for evaluating the early results of this procedure. METHODS Patients who underwent DA from January to December 2014 were reviewed retrospectively. Twenty lesions from 14 patients with femoral artery stenosis (>70% stenosis) with short segment occlusive lesions (<2 cm in length) were treated. Among 20 lesions, 3 were treated with the TurboHawk system with a protective device due to lesion calcification. The percentage of stenosis during and after DA was determined with USG. RESULTS Median follow-up was 5.1 months, and the procedural success rate (<30% stenosis at the end of the procedure) was 100% on angiography, but only 30% on intraoperative USG. On USG, median residual stenosis was 40% (range, 28%-42%) at the end of DA, 40% (range, 30%-55%) at 1 month, 55% (range, 35%-85%) at 6 months, and 64% (range, 60%-100%) at 1 year. There was one dissection, but no cases of perforation, pseudoaneurysm, or thrombosis. Primary patency, which was defined as a peak systolic velocity ratio \u22643.5 with no reintervention at 6 months, was found in 18 lesions (90%), and 11 of 14 patients (78.6%) were free of ischemic symptoms such as claudication at 6 months. CONCLUSION Our results demonstrated that DA with intraoperative USG is an effective treatment option for short segment occlusive lesions of the femoral artery.", " Metformin, a widely used hypoglycemic drug, reduces stroke incidence and alleviates chronic inflammation in clinical trials. However, the effect of metformin in ischemic stroke is unclear. Here, we investigated the effect of metformin on ischemic stroke in mice and further explored the possible underlying mechanisms. METHODS Ninety-eight adult male CD-1 mice underwent 90-minute transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). Metformin (200 mg/kg) was administrated for up to 14 days. Neurobehavioral outcomes, brain infarct volume, inflammatory factors, blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and AMPK signaling pathways were evaluated following tMCAO. Oxygen glucose deprivation was performed on bEND.3 cells to explore the mechanisms of metformin in inhibiting inflammatory signaling pathways. RESULTS Infarct volume was reduced in metformin-treated mice compared to the control group following tMCAO (P < 0.05). Neurobehavioral outcomes were greatly improved in metformin-treated mice (P < 0.05). MPO+ cells, Gr1+ cells, MPO activity and BBB permeability were decreased after metformin administration (P < 0.05). In addition, metformin activated AMPK phosphorylation, inhibited NF-\u03baB activation, down-regulated cytokine (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1) and ICAM-1 expression following tMCAO (P < 0.05). Furthermore, metformin activated AMPK signaling pathway and alleviated oxygen-glucose deprivation-induced ICAM-1 expression in bEND.3 cells (P < 0.05). Compound C, a selective AMPK inhibitor, eliminated this promotional effect. CONCLUSIONS Metformin down-regulated ICAM-1 in an AMPK-dependent manner, which could effectively prevent ischemia-induced brain injury by alleviating neutrophil infiltration, suggesting that metformin is a promising therapeutic agent in stroke therapy.", " Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has demonstrated its effectiveness in controlling metastases measuring less than 3 cm in several adult malignancies but not yet in osteosarcoma. We report our experience of RFA in the treatment of metastases in adolescents and young adults (AYA) with osteosarcoma. PROCEDURE Sixteen patients treated for osteosarcoma in French Society of Childhood Cancer centers had undergone an RFA procedure between 2006 and 2012. RESULTS Thirteen sessions were performed in 10 patients to treat 22 lung metastases. Seven patients were in complete remission at last follow up (range 19-51 months; median, 24 months after RFA). None had a recurrence at RFA sites. We report three cases each of hemoptysis and pneumothorax. Eight sessions were performed in seven patients to treat bone lesions. PROCEDURE was intended as: curative for a small metastatic lesion (n = 3, all in remission more than 3 years after); local control of small bone lesions in multi-metastatic diseases (n = 3); analgesia (n = 1). Complications included one first-degree burn, one fracture, and one soft tissue infection. CONCLUSIONS RFA is feasible in AYA with osteosarcoma. It efficiently achieved local control of small peripheral lung metastases. Its role in the curative care of small secondary bone lesions remains to be confirmed.", "PURPOSE A flow diverter (FD) is an effective treatment option for intracranial aneurysms. The Flow Re-direction Endoluminal Device (FRED) is a relatively new flow diverter with a unique dual-layer design. We report our experience and short-term results with the FRED. MATERIALS AND METHODS We did a retrospective review of all consecutive cases in which the FRED was used to treat intracranial aneurysms at a single institution from March 2014 till December 2015. Clinical parameters, aneurysm characteristics, technical results and short-term outcomes were reviewed. RESULTS Eleven intracranial aneurysms were treated with the FRED in 11 patients. The technical device deployment success rate was 100%. Immediate reduction in intra-aneurysmal flow after deployment was noted in 10 cases. The aneurysm occlusion rate at 6 months was 75%. There was 1 complication of in-stent thrombosis immediately after deployment. There was no side branch occlusion, delayed aneurysm rupture, stroke, or intraparenchymal haemorrhage. There was no neurological deficit, morbidity, or mortality. CONCLUSION The FRED is a new FD. It has shown to be safe and effective in our series. The unique dual-layer design of the device renders it to have technical advantages over other FDs. The 6-month aneurysm occlusion rate and complication profile of FRED are similar to other FDs.", "Less invasive approaches continue to be explored and refined for diseases of the colon and rectum. The current gold standard for the surgical treatment of rectal cancer, total mesorectal excision (TME), is a technically precise yet demanding procedure with outcomes measured by both oncologic and functional outcomes (including bowel, urinary, and sexual). To date, the minimally invasive approach to rectal cancer has not yet been perfected, leaving ample opportunity for rectal surgeons to innovate. Transanal TME has recently emerged as a safe and effective technique for both benign and malignant diseases of the rectum. While widespread acceptance of this surgical approach remains tempered at this time due to lack of long-term oncologic outcome data, short-term outcomes are promising and there is great excitement surrounding the promise of this technique.", "Enhanced cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT-E) has recently generated interest as a potentially useful treatment for eating disorders (ED). In the current study, we conducted a systematic review of the outcome literature on CBT-E, with both narrative and meta-analytic synthesis. We included single-group uncontrolled pre-post design studies and randomised control trials (RCTs) of CBT-E, which allowed us to include a larger number of studies, and also compare the two methodologies in terms of effect size. The primary analysis included 15 CBT-E studies with a total of 948 participants. Narrative synthesis examined bingeing and purging episodes, BMI change, and follow-up results. A large, statistically significant effect supported CBT-E as a treatment for all EDs (g = 1.06). When comparing methodologies, both pre-post design studies (g = 1.26) and RCTs (g = 0.82) yielded large effects. Narrative synthesis outlined reductions in ED behaviours and increases in BMI which were maintained at follow-up. Limitations include that further RCTs of CBT-E are needed to establish clinical effectiveness of this treatment approach for all EDs; however, results from narrative exploration indicate this endeavour would be worthwhile. Despite the limitations, this study provides additional support for CBT-E as a successful treatment across the range of EDs.", "Perivascularly implanted matrix embedded endothelial cells (MEECs) are potent regulators of inflammation and intimal hyperplasia following vascular injuries. Endothelial cells (ECs) in collagen scaffolds adopt a reparative phenotype with significant therapeutic potential. Although the biology of MEECs is increasingly understood, tuning of scaffold properties to control cell-substrate interactions is less well-studied. It is hypothesized that modulating scaffold degradation would change EC phenotype. Scaffolds with differential degradation are prepared by cross-linking and predegradation. Vascular injury increases degradation and the presence of MEECs retards injury-mediated degradation. MEECs respond to differential scaffold properties with altered viability in vivo, suppressed smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation in vitro, and altered interleukin-6 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression. When implanted perivascularly to a murine carotid wire injury, tuned scaffolds change MEEC effects on vascular repair and inflammation. Live animal imaging enables real-time tracking of cell viability, inflammation, and scaffold degradation, affording an unprecedented understanding of interactions between cells, substrate, and tissue. MEEC-treated injuries improve endothelialization and reduce SMC hyperplasia over 14 d. These data demonstrate the potent role material design plays in tuning MEEC efficacy in vivo, with implications for the design of clinical therapies.", " Reduced mortality from lung cancer by computed tomography (CT) screening facilitates the use of video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) lung wedge resection to obtain a definite diagnosis and to treat tiny nodules. The authors evaluated their initial experience using novel needlescopic VATS wedge resection combined with the subcostal trans-diaphragmatic (SCTD) approach for managing undetermined peripheral pulmonary nodules. METHODS Between 2009 and 2012, 35 patients who had 36 operations underwent needlescopic VATS wedge pulmonary resection with the SCTD approach. Preoperative percutaneous CT-guided marking of the nodule was performed. Two 3-mm miniports were placed in the thorax for the thoracoscopic camera and minigrasper. Just anterior to the 10th rib, a 2-cm subcostal incision was made, and a 12- or 15-mm port was placed trans-diaphragmatically into the chest cavity. Wedge resection of the lung was performed with endostaplers introduced through a subcostal port. RESULTS The median tumor size was 1.1 cm. Localization of the tumor was widely distributed. The mean operation time was 51 min, and the mean blood loss was 4.2 mL. No patients required conversion to thoracotomy, and one patient required conversion to conventional VATS. Additional thoracic ports were placed in five patients, and the needlescopic incision was extended to 15 mm in one patient. The median duration of chest drainage was 1 day. Additional analgesia was not required for 22 patients and was used for less than 1 day for three patients, less than 2 days for seven patients, and less than 3 days for seven patients. The pathologic diagnosis of the nodules was malignant for 28 patients and benign for 8 patients. On postoperative day 7 or at admission, 34 patients were free of postoperative neuralgia. CONCLUSIONS Needlescopic VATS wedge pulmonary resection combined with the SCTD approach is both safe and feasible and offers the specific advantages of minimal invasiveness and good cosmetic outcomes.", "We aimed to demonstrate the feasibility and total cost of laparoscopy-assisted suprapubic salpingectomy (LASS), which utilises conventional open surgery equipment without any sealing or coagulation devices and reduces port sites compared to conventional laparoscopy (CL). Fifty-seven consecutive, age-matched patients presenting with a tubal pregnancy were enrolled. In the LASS group, a 10 mm reusable umbilical optical trocar and a 10 mm suprapubic trocar was used. The other 30 patients were managed with multiport CL. All of the patients were asked to use the visual analogue scale and Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale to evaluate their cosmetic satisfaction. The duration of surgery was 21.19 \u00b1 2.33 minutes for the LASS group and 36.9 \u00b1 4.9 minutes for the CL group (p < .001). The postoperative 6th-hour VAS score was 2.44 \u00b1 0.5 for the LASS group and 3.03 \u00b1 0.8 for the CL group (p: .005). All of the PSAS and OSAS parameter scores were significantly lower in LASS group than CL group. In conclusion, the LASS procedure is a feasible method for treating ectopic pregnancies with a shorter surgical duration, lower VAS scores, and better cosmetic scores than CL. Impact statement What is already known on this subject? Laparoscopy or laparotomy may be performed for the surgical management of ectopic pregnancy. Conventional laparoscopy has some advantages such as shorter hospital stay and recovery time and the better cosmetic results. However, the equipment used in conventional laparoscopy and single incision laparoscopy are more expensive than conventional open surgery equipment. What the results of this study add? Laparoscopy-assisted suprapubic salpingectomy (LASS) method has shorter operation time, lower VAS scores, better cosmetic scores and cheaper than conventional laparoscopy. What the implications are of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? The LASS procedure looks like a feasible method for treating ectopic pregnancies and the feasibility of this procedure should be confirmed by a larger series of patients and randomised trials.", "Essentials Strategies to improve platelet function may reduce excessive bleeding during cardiac surgery. Patients were randomized to standard care or standard care + noradrenaline infusion. Low-dose noradrenaline improved intraoperative platelet aggregation and clot formation. Noradrenaline may be considered to improve intraoperative hemostasis during cardiac surgery. SUMMARY: Background New approaches to prevent bleeding complications during cardiac surgery are needed. Objective To investigate if noradrenaline (NA) enhances platelet aggregation in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Patients/Methods Twenty-four patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) were included in a prospective parallel-group randomized study. All patients but one were treated with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). In the treatment group (n = 12), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) was maintained at pre-induction levels by NA infusion. In the control group (n = 12), NA was administered only if MAP decreased below 60 mmHg. Platelet aggregation (impedance aggregometry with ADP, arachidonic acid [AA] and thrombin-receptor activating peptide [TRAP] as initiators) and clot formation (clotting time, clot formation time and maximum clot firmness by EXTEM, INTEM and FIBTEM tests with thromboelastometry) were assessed before and 50 min after anesthesia induction (before cardiopulmonary bypass was initiated). Results All patients in the treatment group received NA (median dose after 50 min 0.09 (range 0-0.26) \u03bcg kg-1 min-1 ). Four patients in the control group also received NA (0.03-0.12 \u03bcg kg-1 min-1 ). There were differences between the treatment group and the control group in ADP- and AA-induced aggregation changes (ADP, +16 [25th-75th percentiles, 5-26] vs. -7 [-19 to -1] U; AA, +12 [-4 to 16] vs. -9 [-13 to 1] U). INTEM maximum clot firmness increased in the treatment group but not in the control group. Conclusion Infusion of clinically relevant doses of NA enhanced platelet aggregation and clot firmness in ASA-treated CABG patients. NA infusion is hence a potential new method to acutely improve platelet reactivity in patients on antiplatelet therapy undergoing surgery.", "Background. Laparoscopic appendicectomy is accepted by many as the gold standard approach for the treatment of acute appendicitis. The use of Single Incision Laparoscopic Surgery (SILS) has the potential of further reducing postoperative port site complications as well as improving cosmesis and patient satisfaction. Method. In this paper we report our experience and assess the feasibility of SILS appendicectomy in the pediatric setting. Results. Five pediatric patients with uncomplicated appendicitis underwent SILS appendicectomy. There were no significant intraoperative or postoperative complications. All patients were discharged within 24 hours. Conclusions. The use of Single Incision Laparoscopic Surgery appears to be a feasible and safe technique for the treatment of uncomplicated appendicitis in the pediatric setting. Further studies are warranted to fully investigate the potential advantages of this new technique.", "PURPOSE The Medical Research Council CR07/National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group C016 (MRC CR07/NCIC CTG C016) trial showed that, in patients with operable rectal cancer, short-course preoperative radiotherapy (PRE) reduced the rate of local recurrence compared with surgery followed by selective postoperative chemoradiotherapy for patients with a positive circumferential resection margin. However, the advantages of giving PRE to all patients needs to be balanced against any negative impact on patients' quality of life. PATIENTS AND METHODS All 1,350 patients were asked to complete the Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form 36-item (MOS SF-36) and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Colorectal 38-item (EORTC QLQ-CR38) questionnaires. A priori hypotheses related to the impact of treatment on sexual, bowel, and physical function and general health. RESULTS Male sexual dysfunction was significantly increased following surgery (P < .001), although there was no difference between treatment arms. However, a treatment difference had emerged at 6 months (PRE patients reporting significantly greater dysfunction; P = .004), which persisted out to at least 2 years (an insufficient number of female patients completed the sexual dysfunction questions to draw firm conclusions). Both treatment groups reported similar levels of decreased physical function at 3 months, but thereafter it returned to baseline levels. There was no evidence of any major changes between treatments or time points in terms of general health or bowel function, but exploratory analysis indicated a significant (P = .006 at 2 years) increase in the level of fecal incontinence with PRE. CONCLUSION These results from a large randomized trial using validated patient-completed questionnaires show that, for males, the main adverse effect was sexual dysfunction, and the main cause of this was surgery, but that PRE also affected sexual and some aspects of bowel functioning.", " AND PURPOSE There is controversy as to the best mode of treating MCA aneurysms. We report the results of a large endovascular series of patients treated at our center. MATERIALS AND METHODS This study was a retrospective analysis of a prospectively acquired data base. All patients with saccular MCA aneurysms treated between November 1996 and June 2012 were included. World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies grade, aneurysm site, size, and aneurysm neck size were recorded, along with clinical outcome assessed with the Glasgow Outcome Scale and radiographic occlusion assessed with the Raymond classification at 6 months and 2.5 years. RESULTS A total of 295 patients with 300 MCA aneurysms were treated including 244 ruptured aneurysms (80.7%). The technical failure rate was 4.3% (13 patients). Complete occlusion or neck remnant was achieved in 264 (91.4%). Complications included rupture in 15 patients (5%), thromboembolism in 17 patients (5.7%), and early rebleeding in 3 patients (1%). Overall permanent procedural-related morbidity and mortality were seen in 12 patients (7.8%). Of the ruptured aneurysms, 189 (79.4%) had a favorable clinical outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale score, 4-5). A total of 33 patients (13.6%) died. On initial angiographic follow-up, aneurysm remnant was seen in 18 aneurysms (8.1%). A total of 13 patients (4.3%) were re-treated. CONCLUSIONS Our experience demonstrates that endovascular treatment of MCA aneurysms has an acceptable safety profile with low rates of technical failure and re-treatment. Therefore, coiling is acceptable as the primary treatment of MCA aneurysms.", " We report a case of ophthalmic artery occlusion (OAO) in a young patient with Covid-19 infection that was on therapeutic anticoagulation with apixaban for deep venous thrombosis (DVT). A 48-year-old man with obesity was hospitalized with a severe form of Covid-19 infection, complicated with acute respiratory failure, septic shock, dilated cardiomyopathy and fungemia. Despite treatment with prophylactic enoxaparin (initial D-Dimer 1.14 \u00b5g/ml FEU (normal < 0.05 \u00b5g/ml FEU), D-Dimer increased to above 20 \u00b5g/ml FEU and patient continued to spike high fevers. This prompted further investigations and upper and lower extremities DVTs were confirmed and managed with enoxaparin 1mg/kg twice daily. D-dimer level decreased to 4.98 \u00b5g/ml FEU while on therapeutic anticoagulation. Three weeks later pending hospital discharge, the anticoagulation was switched to oral apixaban 10 mg twice daily. Patient developed acute severe right eye visual loss of no light perception and was diagnosed with incomplete OAO. D-Dimer was elevated at 2.13 \u00b5g/ml FEU. Stroke etiological work-up found no embolic sources, resolution of the dilated cardiomyopathy and negative antiphospholipid antibodies. Treatment was changed to enoxaparin and no thrombotic events were encountered to date. Ocular vascular complications have not yet been reported in Covid-19. Controversy exists on the best management algorithm for the hypercoagulable state associated to Covid-19. Either direct oral anticoagulants or low-molecular-weight-heparin are considered appropriate at discharge for patients with venous thromboembolism. The optimum regimen for ischemic stroke prevention and the significance of D-Dimer for anticoagulation monitoring in Covid-19 remain unclear..", " Short-term follow-up studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) survivors suggested that their physical conditions continuously improved in the first year but that their mental health did not. We investigated long-term psychiatric morbidities and chronic fatigue among SARS survivors. METHODS All SARS survivors from the hospitals of a local region in Hong Kong were assessed by a constellation of psychometric questionnaires and a semistructured clinical interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition) to determine the presence of psychiatric disorders and chronic fatigue problems. RESULTS Of 369 SARS survivors, 233 (63.1%) participated in the study (mean period of time after SARS, 41.3 months). Over 40% of the respondents had active psychiatric illnesses, 40.3% reported a chronic fatigue problem, and 27.1% met the modified 1994 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome. Logistic regression analysis suggested that being a health care worker at the time of SARS infection (odds ratio [OR], 3.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12- 9.39; P = .03), being unemployed at follow-up (OR, 4.71; 95% CI, 1.50-14.78; P = .008), having a perception of social stigmatization (OR, 3.03; 95% CI, 1.20-7.60; P = .02), and having applied to the SARS survivors' fund (OR, 2.92; 95% CI, 1.18-7.22; P = .02) were associated with an increased risk of psychiatric morbidities at follow-up, whereas application to the SARS survivors' fund (OR, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.07-6.51; P = .04) was associated with increased risk of chronic fatigue problems. CONCLUSIONS Psychiatric morbidities and chronic fatigue persisted and continued to be clinically significant among the survivors at the 4-year follow-up. Optimization of the treatment of mental health morbidities by a multidisciplinary approach with a view for long-term rehabilitation, especially targeting psychiatric and fatigue problems and functional and occupational rehabilitation, would be needed.", " Angiomyolipoma (AML) is the most common renal benign tumor. Treatment should be considered for symptomatic patients or for those at risk for complications, especially retroperitoneal bleeding which is correlated to tumor size, grade of the angiogenic component and to the presence of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). This study reports our single-center experience with the use of selective arterial embolization (SAE) in the management of symptomatic and asymptomatic renal AMLs. METHODS In this retrospective mono-centric study, all demographic and imaging data, medical records, angiographic features, outpatient charts and follow-up visits of patients who underwent prophylactic or emergency SAE for AMLs between January 2005 and July 2016 were reviewed. Tumor size and treatment outcomes were assessed at baseline and after the procedure during follow-up. Computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or ultrasonography was used to evaluate AML shrinkage. Renal function was measured pre- and post-procedure. RESULTS Twenty-three patients (18 females, 5 males; median age, 45 years; range, 19-85 years) who underwent SAE either to treat bleeding AML (n=6) or as a prophylactic treatment (n=17) were included. Overall, 34 AMLs were embolized. TSC status was confirmed for 6 patients. Immediate technical success rate was 96% and 4 patients benefitted from an additional procedure. Major complications occurred in 3 patients and minor post-embolization syndrome (PES) in 14 patients. The mean AML size reduction rate was 26.2% after a mean follow-up was 20.5 months (range, 0.5-56 months), and only non-TSC status was significantly associated with better shrinkage of tumor (P=0.022). Intralesional aneurysms were significantly more frequent in patients with hemorrhagic presentation (P=0.008). There was no change in mean creatinine level after SAE. CONCLUSIONS SAE is a safe and effective technique to manage renal AMLs as a preventive treatment as well as in emergency setting, with significant reduction in tumor size during follow-up. A multidisciplinary approach remains fundamental, especially for TSC patients. In addition to size, the presence of intralesional aneurysms should be considered in any prophylactic treatment decision.", " A fiberglass short arm cast can be used to treat a distal radial fracture, but posttraumatic edema may lead to excessive cast tightness and resultant soft-tissue injury. We sought to quantify a simulated edema-induced pressure within a fiberglass short arm cast and to determine the effectiveness of different cast-cutting methods for pressure reduction. We hypothesized that cast cutting could eliminate all clinically relevant pressure and Ace wrap would insignificantly increase pressure. METHODS Skin surface pressure under fiberglass short arm casts was measured on ninety wrists from forty-five volunteers randomly assigned to one cast-cutting method: single-cut (cast bivalve and Ace wrap), double-cut (cast bivalve, spread, and Ace wrap), or triple-cut (cast bivalve, spread, Webril cut, and Ace wrap). Each wrist was immobilized in a cast in the neutral position with one roll of 2-inch (5.1-cm) cotton Webril and one roll of 2-inch (5.1-cm) fiberglass. Each fiberglass short arm cast contained an empty intravenous fluid bag in which we infused air. This simulated edema, which generated a skin surface pressure, which was measured by a pressure transducer. RESULTS Each cast-cutting method significantly reduced (p < 0.0001) the skin surface pressure from the average maximum of 92.5 mm Hg in a non-fracture setting. Prior to Ace wrapping, there was a reduction in skin surface pressure of 70.8% for the single-cut method, 85.1% for the double-cut method, and 99.9% for the triple-cut method. Ace wrap significantly increased skin surface pressure (p < 0.0001), lessening the effectiveness of cast cutting. There was an overall reduction in skin surface pressure of 55.9% for the single-cut method, 64.3% for the double-cut method, and 77.2% for the triple-cut method. Throughout our study, women had significantly higher skin surface pressure than men (p < 0.0001); the average maximum was 104.4 mm Hg for women and 81.1 mm Hg for men. CONCLUSIONS The single-cut method provides the greatest pressure reduction, but only the triple-cut method eliminated all relevant skin surface pressure. Ace wrapping a cut cast noticeably increased skin surface pressure. CLINICAL RELEVANCE In volunteers without a fracture, only the triple-cut method is effective enough to eliminate clinically relevant skin surface pressure. Ace wrap should be applied with caution after the cast is cut. The specific effect on pressure reduction in a patient who requires some soft-tissue pressure to maintain fracture reduction was not studied.", "Noroviruses are the main cause of viral gastroenteritis with new variants emerging frequently. There are three norovirus genogroups infecting humans. These genogroups are divided based on the sequence of their major capsid protein, which is able to form virus-like particles (VLPs) when expressed recombinantly. VLPs of the prototypical GI.1 Norwalk virus are known to disassemble into specific capsid protein oligomers upon alkaline treatment. Here, native mass spectrometry and electron microscopy on variants of GI.1 and of GII.17 were performed, revealing differences in terms of stability between these groups. Beyond that, these experiments indicate differences even between variants within a genotype. The capsid stability was monitored in different ammonium acetate solutions varying both in ionic strength and pH. The investigated GI.1 West Chester isolate showed comparable disassembly profiles to the previously studied GI.1 Norwalk virus isolate. However, differences were observed with the West Chester being more sensitive to alkaline pH. In stark contrast to that, capsids of the variant belonging to the currently prevalent genogroup GII were stable in all tested conditions. Both variants formed smaller capsid particles already at neutral pH. Certain amino acid substitutions in the S domain of West Chester relative to the Norwalk virus potentially result in the formation of these T = 1 capsids.", "When tinnitus is pulse-synchronous, a vascular etiology is suggested. We present a case of persistent and troublesome pulsatile tinnitus caused by a transverse-sigmoid sinus diverticulum that was endovascularly treated with stent-assisted coiling. A 39-yearold woman presented with a 4-year history of progressive pulsatile tinnitus involving the right ear. Slight pulsatile bruit was heard on the right mastoid bone by auscultation. Cerebral angiography demonstrated a diverticulum of the transverse-sigmoid sinus. The procedure was performed with an 8F guiding catheter (Cordis, USA) catheterized into the right sigmoid sinus. The diverticulum was completely coiled following deployment of a 5.5 mm-50 mm Leo stent. This patient awakened without any neurological deficit and with immediate resolution of her tinnitus. This case report describes a stent-assisted coil embolization of venous sinus diverticulum, which provides immediate resolution of pulsatile tinnitus.", " Extensive deep venous thrombosis (DVT) during pregnancy is usually treated with anticoagulation alone, risking significant post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) in young patients. Catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) and operative venous thrombectomy have been safely and effectively used in nonpregnant patients, demonstrating significant reduction in post-thrombotic morbidity. This report reviews short- and long-term outcomes of 13 patients with extensive DVT of pregnancy treated with a strategy of thrombus removal. METHODS From 1999 to 2013, 13 patients with iliofemoral DVT during pregnancy were offered CDT, pharmacomechanical thrombolysis (PMT), and/or venous thrombectomy. Gestational age ranged from 8 to 34 weeks. Fetal monitoring was performed throughout hospitalization. Radiation exposure was minimized with pelvic lead shields, focal fluoroscopy, and limited angiographic runs. Follow-up included objective vein evaluation using venous duplex and PTS assessment using the Villalta scale. RESULTS CDT and/or PMT were used in 11 patients. Two patients underwent venous thrombectomy alone, and one patient had operative thrombectomy as an adjunct to CDT and PMT. Each patient had complete or near-complete thrombus resolution and rapid improvement in clinical symptoms. Eight of 11 having CDT or PMT underwent venoplasty and stenting of the involved iliac veins. Twelve of the 13 delivered healthy infants at term. One patient opted for termination of her pregnancy. Mean patient and gestational ages were 26 years and 26 weeks, respectively. Mean follow-up was 1.3 years, with only one recurrence. Duplex ultrasonography demonstrated patent veins in all but one patient and normal valve function in 10 patients. Eleven patients had Villalta scores <5 (considered normal), with a mean score of 0.7. CONCLUSIONS Extensive DVT of pregnancy can be effectively and safely treated with a strategy of thrombus removal, resulting in a patent venous system, normal valve function in many, prevention of PTS, and reduction in recurrence.", "Major ischaemic stroke is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in industrialized countries. For patients with acute stroke, fast and effective vessel recanalization is important for successful treatment. Neurothrombectomy--that is, angiographically performed mechanical thrombus removal from intracranial arteries--results in higher recanalization rates than with pharmaceutical thrombolysis alone, but the value of this treatment in terms of clinical outcome remains to be established. This article summarizes the history of intra-arterial stroke treatment, outlines the recent developments and the different techniques used, and discusses the results of current studies on neurothrombectomy. Owing to the high morphological and clinical variability of stroke, careful patient selection in future randomized controlled trials will be crucial for assessment of the true potential of neurothrombectomy.", " AND OBJECTIVES Fentanyl sublingual spray may be a viable alternative to intravenous (IV) opioids for the treatment of acute pain. As patients with acute pain may include those who have limited prior exposure to opioids, this phase 1, open-label, randomized, multiple ascending-dose study was conducted to assess the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, and tolerability of multiple doses of fentanyl sublingual spray in opioid-na\u00efve participants. This article primarily reports the pharmacokinetics results. METHODS Study drugs were administered in four dosing cohorts: every 0.5, 1, 2, or 4 h for a maximum of three doses per cohort. Eight fasted individuals per cohort were randomized to either fentanyl sublingual spray (100, 200, or 400 \u00b5g) or fentanyl citrate IV 50 \u00b5g (6:2 ratio). Blood samples were collected pre-dose through 24 h post first dose. RESULTS A total of 98 healthy adults were enrolled and 96 completed the study. Mean plasma fentanyl concentrations increased with increasing doses of fentanyl sublingual spray administered every 0.5-4 h. With multiple doses, systemic exposure increased relative to the first dose; shorter dosing intervals resulted in higher concentrations. Analysis of dose proportionality suggested that systemic exposure increased in a linear but slightly greater than dose-proportional manner. Accumulation between the first and last doses of fentanyl sublingual spray was more pronounced with shorter dosing intervals. CONCLUSION Dose-dependent fentanyl pharmacokinetics following multiple doses of fentanyl sublingual spray were well characterized in an opioid-na\u00efve population. CLINICALTRIALS. GOV IDENTIFIER NCT02641340.", "PURPOSE Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) with [177Lu]Lu-DOTA0,TYR3-octreotate ([177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE) and the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor everolimus are both approved for the treatment of neuroendocrine tumours (NET). However, tumour progression is still frequent, and treatment strategies need further improvement. One possible approach could be to combine different therapy options. In this study, we investigated the toxicity of a combined treatment with everolimus and [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE in female Lewis rats. METHODS Animals received 200 MBq of [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE once and/or 5 mg/kg body weight everolimus or placebo weekly for 16 weeks and were divided into four groups (group 1, placebo; group 2, everolimus; group 3, placebo + [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE; group 4, everolimus + [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE). Blood levels of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were assessed weekly to monitor nephrotoxicity, and a full blood count was performed at the time of euthanasia to monitor myelotoxicity. Additionally, renal function was analysed by sequential [99mTc]Tc-mercaptoacetyltriglycine ([99mTc]Tc-MAG3) scintigraphies. Histopathological examination was performed in all the kidneys using a standardized renal damage score (RDS). RESULTS Rats receiving everolimus showed a significantly lower increase in creatinine levels than those receiving placebo. Everolimus therapy reduced white blood count significantly, which was not observed for [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE. Functional renal scintigraphies using [99mTc]Tc-MAG3 showed a compromised initial tracer uptake after PRRT and slower but still preserved excretion after everolimus. Histology showed no significant RDS differences between groups. CONCLUSION Renal scintigraphy is a highly sensitive tool for the detection of renal function impairment after a combination of everolimus and PRRT. Additional treatment with everolimus does not increase renal and haematological toxicity of PRRT with [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE.", "During the COVID-19 pandemic, breast imaging must be performed using safe practices. Balancing the need to avoid delays in the diagnosis of breast cancer while avoiding infection requires careful attention to personal protective equipment and physical distancing and vigilance to maintain these practices. The Canadian Society of Breast Imaging/Canadian Association of Radiologists guideline for breast imaging during COVID-19 is provided based on priority according to risk of breast cancer and impact of delaying treatment. A review of the best practices is presented that allow breast imaging during COVID-19 to maximize protection of patients, technologists, residents, fellows, and radiologists and minimize spread of the infection. The collateral damage of delaying diagnosis of breast cancer due to COVID-19 should be avoided when possible.", "Epidemic prevention and control measures for the new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has achieved significant results. As of 8 April 2020, 22,073 infection cases of COVID-19 among healthcare workers from 52 countries had been reported to WHO. COVID-19 has strong infectivity, high transmission speeds, and causes serious infection among healthcare worker. Burns are an acute-care condition, and burn treatment needs to be initiated before COVID-19 infection status can be excluded. The key step to infection prevention is to identify risk points of infection exposure, strengthen the protection against those risk points, and formulate an appropriate diagnosis and treatment protocol. Following an in-depth study of the latest literature on COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment, we reviewed the protocols surrounding hospitalization of patients with extensive burns (area\u226550%) in our hospital from February 2009 to February 2019 and, in accordance with the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19, developed an algorithm for protection during diagnosis and treatment of burns. Therefore, the aspects of medical protection and the diagnosis and treatment of burns appear to be particularly important during the prevention and control of the COVID-19. This algorithm was followed for 4 patients who received emergency treatment in February 2020 and were hospitalized. All healthcare worker were protected according to the three-tiered protective measures, and there was no nosocomial infection. During the COVID-19 epidemic, the early stages of emergency treatment for patients with extensive burns requiring the establishment of venous access for rehydration, endotracheal intubation or tracheostomy, wound treatment, and surgery are the risk points for exposure to infection. The implementation of effective, appropriate-grade protection and formulation of practical treatment protocols can increase protection of healthcare worke and reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection exposure.", "Autophagy is important for a variety for virus life cycles. We sought to determine the role of autophagy in human BK polyomavirus (BKPyV) infection. The addition excess amino acids during viral infection reduced BKPyV infection. Perturbing autophagy levels using inhibitors, 3-MA, bafilomycin A1, and spautin-1, also reduced infection, while rapamycin treatment of host cells increased infection. siRNA knockdown of autophagy genes, ATG7 and Beclin-1, corresponded to a decrease in BKPyV infection. BKPyV infection not only correlated with autophagosome formation, but also virus particles localized to autophagy-specific compartments early in infection. These data support a novel role for autophagy in the promotion of BKPyV infection.", "Several biomaterials have been proposed to treat anal fistula alone or in combination with other surgical procedures aiming to reduce recurrence rates while minimizing continence impairment. More recently a porcine dermal matrix injection has been proposed as infill biomaterial to treat fistulae. We propose an approach consisting of non-cutting seton positioning followed several weeks later by flap repair associated with dermal matrix injection into the fistula tracts. We report our experience with this two-staged procedure on 24 consecutive patients with complex anal fistulae with a median follow up of > 12 months. In our experience this two-stage approach seems to be safe and effective.", "OBJECTIVES We developed a novel technique of the extracted-overlay function in CT/MR-ultrasonography (US) fusion imaging for radiofrequency ablation (RFA), in which only a tumor extracted from CT/MR images with a virtual ablative margin of arbitrary thickness is overlaid on US. The usefulness of this function is investigated in this preliminary report. METHODS The volume data of the extracted tumor with a virtual ablative margin were created on an image-processing workstation, and transported into a US unit equipped with a CT/MR-US fusion imaging system. After the positional registration of US and transported images, the extracted tumor with an ablative margin could be overlaid on US. In RFA, using this function, an electrode was inserted targeting the overlaid tumor with an ablative safety margin of 5 mm on US, and the treatment effect was evaluated by dynamic CT. Treatment results of 23 consecutive hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) that underwent RFA using this function were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS Complete tumor ablation was achieved in 22 (95.7%) and 1 (4.3%) HCCs in 1 and 2 treatment sessions, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Due to the visualization of an extracted tumor with an ablative safety margin on a US image, even during and after ablation, this function is useful for treatment planning and guidance of RFA.", "Acute ischemic stroke and timing of treatment--reply.", " Across sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), HIV disproportionately affects men-who-have-sex-with-men (MSM) compared with other men of the same age group in the general population. Access to HIV services remains low among this group although several effective interventions have been documented. It is therefore important to identify what has worked well to increase the reach of HIV services among MSM. METHODS We searched MEDLINE, POPLINE and the Web of Science databases to collect published articles reporting HIV interventions among MSM across sub-Saharan Africa. Covidence was used to review the articles. The review protocol was registered in International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) - CRD42017060808. RESULTS The search identified 2627 citations, and following removal of duplicates and inclusion and exclusion criteria, only 15 papers were eligible for inclusion in the review. The articles reported various accrual strategies, namely: respondent driven sampling, known peers identified through hotspot or baseline surveys, engagement with existing community-based organizations, and through peer educators contacting MSM in virtual sites. Some programs, however, combined some of these accrual strategies. Peer-led outreach services were indicated to reach and deliver services to more MSM. A combination of peer outreach and mobile clinics increased uptake of health information and services. Health facilities, especially MSM-friendly facilities attract access and use of services by MSM and retention into care. CONCLUSIONS There are various strategies for accrual and delivering services to MSM across SSA. However, each of these strategies have specific strengths and weaknesses necessitating combinations of interventions and integration of the specific context to inform implementation. If the best of intervention content and implementation are used to inform these services, sufficient coverage and impact of HIV prevention and treatment programs for MSM across SSA can be optimized.", "Several biomaterials have been proposed to treat anal fistula alone or in combination with other surgical procedures aiming to reduce recurrence rates while minimizing continence impairment. More recently a porcine dermal matrix injection has been proposed as infill biomaterial to treat fistulae. We propose an approach consisting of non-cutting seton positioning followed several weeks later by flap repair associated with dermal matrix injection into the fistula tracts. We report our experience with this two-staged procedure on 24 consecutive patients with complex anal fistulae with a median follow up of > 12 months. In our experience this two-stage approach seems to be safe and effective.", " Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is one of the best-known and most commonly performed bariatric procedures. However, this procedure carries infrequent but serious long-term complications, which may require revisional procedures. This study reports the indications and outcomes of gastric bypass reversal that have not been described well in the literature. METHODS A multicenter retrospective study of 50 patients who underwent reversal of RYGB conducted between 2006 and 2015 was reviewed to describe the usual indications and outcomes of gastric bypass reversal surgeries. RESULTS Of 50 patients, 7 (14 %) were males and 43 (86 %) were females. The mean age of the patient population was 40.4 \u00b1 11.6 years (range 19-66). Reasons for reversal included anastomotic ulcers (n = 27), anastomotic complications (n = 9), malnutrition (n = 2), and functional disorder (n = 12). The mean BMI before the reversal was 29 \u00b1 9.4 kg/m(2) (range 16-60). The mean time between the primary procedure and reversal was 60 \u00b1 65.5 months (range 2-300). Fourteen of the reversals were done via laparotomy. Mean hospital stay was 8.4 \u00b1 7.3 days (range 3-34 days). There was no peri-operative death 30 days after reversal. Following gastric bypass reversal, 92.6 % (n = 25) of the patient population had resolution from ulcers, 77.8 % (n = 7) of the patient population had resolution from anatomic complications, 100 % (n = 2) of the patient population had resolution from malnutrition, and 66.7 % (n = 8) of the patient population had resolution from functional disorders. CONCLUSIONS Gastric bypass reversal is a reasonable and safe treatment for complications arising from the GBP surgery. A laparoscopic approach is feasible in select patients.", "PURPOSE To investigate the effects of adalimumab pretreatment on the lipopolysaccharide-mediated myocardial injury. METHODS Twenty-eight Wistar rats were randomized into four groups (n=7). Control (C) group animals were injected once a day with intraperitoneal (i.p) 0.9 % saline for two days. In the Adalimumab (Ada) group, adalimumab was injected at a dose of 10 mg/kg/ day (i.p) for two days. Lipopolysaccharide (Lps) group rats were injected with a dose of 5 mg/kg (i.p) lipopolysaccharide. Lipopolysaccharide + Adalimumab (Lps+Ada) group rats received adalimumab before the administration of lipopolysaccharide. The animals were sacrificed 24 h after the last injection and blood samples were obtained for determination of biochemical cardiac injury markers and circulating levels of TNF-\u03b1 and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Hearts were harvested for histological examination. RESULTS Endotoxin exposure resulted in significant increases in serum cardiac injury markers, serum cytokines and histological myocardial injury scores in the Lps group. The levels of circulating cytokines, cardiac injury markers and histological injury scores for myocardial necrosis, perivascular cell infiltration, and inflammation were significantly reduced in Lps+Ada as compared to Lps group (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS Adalimumab pretreatment reduces endotoxin-induced myocardial damage in rats. This beneficial effect is thought to be related to the reduction of cytokine release.", " Unrecognized periprosthetic joint infections are a concern in revision surgery for aseptic failure (AF) after total hip (THA) or knee (TKA) arthroplasties. A gold diagnostic standard does not exist. The aim of the current study was to determine the prevalence of unrecognized periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) in a cohort of revision for AF, using an experimental diagnostic algorithm. METHODS The surgeons' suspicion of AF was based primarily on patient history and clinical evaluation. X-ray imaging was used to reveal mechanical problems. To rule out an infectious aetiology standard blood biochemical tests were ordered in most patients. Evaluation followed the existing practice in the institute. Cases were included if revision surgery was planned for suspected AF. Intraoperatively, five synovial tissue biopsies were obtained routinely. PJI was defined as \u22653 positive cultures with the same microorganism(s). Patients were followed for 1 year postoperatively. Protocol samples included joint fluid, additional synovial tissue biopsies, bone biopsy, swabs from the implant surface, and sonication of retrieved components. Routine and protocol samples were cultured with extended incubation (14 days) and preserved for batchwise 16S rRNA gene amplification. Patients were stratified based on culture results and a clinical status was obtained at study end. RESULTS A total of 72 revisions were performed on 71 patients (35 THA and 37 TKA). We found five of 72 cases of unrecognized PJI. Extended culture and protocol samples accounted for two of these. One patient diagnosed with AF was treated for a PJI during follow-up. The remaining patients did not change status from AF during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS We found a low prevalence of unrecognized periprosthetic joint infections in patients with an AF diagnosis. The algorithm strengthens the surgeons' preoperative diagnosis of a non-infective condition. Evaluation for a failing TKA or THA is complex. Distinguishing between AF and PJI pre-operatively was a clinical decision. Our data did not support additional testing in routine revision surgery for AF.", "RATIONALE Several Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines recommendations are reevaluated. OBJECTIVES To analyze the effectiveness of treatments recommended in the sepsis guidelines. METHODS In a prospective observational study, we studied all adult patients with severe sepsis from 77 intensive care units. We recorded compliance with four therapeutic goals (central venous pressure 8 mm Hg or greater for persistent hypotension despite fluid resuscitation and/or lactate greater than 36 mg/dl, central venous oxygen saturation 70% or greater for persistent hypotension despite fluid resuscitation and/or lactate greater than 36 mg/dl, blood glucose greater than or equal to the lower limit of normal but less than 150 mg/dl, and inspiratory plateau pressure less than 30 cm H(2)O for mechanically ventilated patients) and four treatments (early broad-spectrum antibiotics, fluid challenge in the event of hypotension and/or lactate greater than 36 mg/dl, low-dose steroids for septic shock, drotrecogin alfa [activated] for multiorgan failure). The primary outcome measure was hospital mortality. The effectiveness of each treatment was estimated using propensity scores. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Of 2,796 patients, 41.6% died before hospital discharge. Treatments associated with lower hospital mortality were early broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment (treatment within 1 hour vs. no treatment within first 6 hours of diagnosis; odds ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.50-0.90; P = 0.008) and drotrecogin alfa (activated) (odds ratio, 0.59; 95% confidence interval, 0.41-0.84; P = 0.004). Fluid challenge and low-dose steroids showed no benefits. CONCLUSIONS In severe sepsis, early administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics in all patients and administration of drotrecogin alfa (activated) in the most severe patients reduce mortality.", "Electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring techniques for neonatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI) are evolving over time, and the specific type of EEG utilized could influence seizure diagnosis and management. We examined whether the type of EEG performed affected seizure treatment decisions (e.g., the choice and number of antiseizure drugs [ASDs]) in therapeutic hypothermia-treated neonates with HI from 2007 to 2015 in the Johns Hopkins Hospital Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. During this period, 3 different EEG monitoring protocols were utilized: Period 1 (2007-2009), single, brief conventional EEG (1 h duration) at a variable time during therapeutic hypothermia treatment, i.e., ordered when a seizure was suspected; Period 2 (2009-2013), single, brief conventional EEG followed by amplitude-integrated EEG for the duration of therapeutic hypothermia treatment and another brief conventional EEG after rewarming; and Period 3 (2014-2015), continuous video-EEG (cEEG) for the duration of therapeutic hypothermia treatment (72 h) plus for an additional 12 h during and after rewarming. One hundred and sixty-two newborns were included in this retrospective cohort study. As a function of the type and duration of EEG monitoring, we assessed the risk (likelihood) of receiving no ASD, at least 1 ASD, or \u22652 ASDs. We found that the risk of a neonate being prescribed an ASD was 46% less during Period 3 (cEEG) than during Period 1 (brief conventional EEG only) (95% CI 6-69%, p = 0.03). After adjusting for initial EEG and MRI results, compared with Period 1, there was a 38% lower risk of receiving an ASD during Period 2 (95% CI: 9-58%, p = 0.02) and a 67% lower risk during Period 3 (95% CI: 23-86%, p = 0.01). The risk ratio of receiving \u22652 ASDs was not significantly different across the 3 periods. In conclusion, in addition to the higher sensitivity and specificity of continuous video-EEG monitoring, fewer infants are prescribed an ASD when undergoing continuous forms of EEG monitoring (aEEG or cEEG) than those receiving conventional EEG. We recommend that use of continuous video-EEG be considered whenever possible, both to treat seizures more specifically and to avoid overtreatment.", "PURPOSE In the treatment of wide-necked aneurysms, stenting may be required after balloon-assisted coiling (BAC) for reconstructing the lumen/flow of the parent artery in cases of coil herniation. The potential benefits and complications of both techniques remain unclear when used together. Our aim was to assess the safety and long-term angiographic outcomes of stenting after BAC. METHODS Retrospective review of 87 unruptured wide necked aneurysms (in 80 patients) treated with BAC and requiring stent placement at the final stage of the procedure due to coil prolapse. Aneurysm characteristics, technical issues, clinical records, and MR results were assessed. Post-treatment and follow-up angiograms were evaluated by two independent reviewers and categorized as \"stable,\" \"further thrombosis,\" or \"recanalization.\" RESULTS The mean maximum diameter was 9.1 \u00b1 4.7 mm and aspect ratio 1.20 \u00b1 0.47. Complete and near-complete initial occlusion were observed in 53 (60.9%) and 28 (32.2%) of all treated aneurysms, respectively. Angiographic follow-up (80 aneurysms; mean, 34.68 \u00b1 25.26 months) revealed stability and further thrombosis in 92.4% (74/80). Recanalization was observed in six cases (7.5%, 6/83), four of which were retreated. No significantly different outcomes were found in terms of aneurysm size (p = 0.641). Transient and reversible procedure-related complications occurred in eight (9.2%), minor permanent deficits in 2.3%, and major deficits, including death, in four cases (4.6%). CONCLUSION Our results suggest that treatment of wide-necked aneuryms with stent placement after BAC yields low recanalization rates and enhanced angiographic outcomes in long-term follow-up.", " The revascularization of carotid stenosis can increase ipsilateral cerebral blood flow (CBF). Occasionally, elevated CBF is also evident on the contralateral side, but this phenomenon is poorly understood. OBJECTIVE To analyze retrospectively the relationship between a contralateral CBF increase and several clinical and radiologic features. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively analyzed 40 patients with unilateral cervical carotid stenosis treated by carotid artery stenting (CAS). Using 123I-iodamphetamine single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT); we compared pre- and postoperative hemispheric CBF on both sides. We investigated the influence of the following five factors on the increase of the contralateral hemispheric CBF: stenosis grade (\u226550% or <50%, according to the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial criteria); age; the presence of anterior and posterior communicating arteries; postoperative hyperperfusion on the stenotic side; and the presence of cerebral steal phenomenon during preoperative acetazolamide-challenge SPECT. RESULTS Following unilateral CAS, mean hemispheric CBF increased significantly on both sides: from 33.4\u00b15.6 (mean \u00b1 SD) to 38.7\u00b17.8 mL/min on the operated side (paired t test, p<0.001) and f35.4\u00b15.4 to 39.2\u00b17.2 mL/min on the contralateral side (p<0.001). In a general linear model, stenosis grade (\u226550%) alone was significantly correlated with the increase of the CBF on the contralateral side (p=0.03). CONCLUSION Revascularization by CAS for unilateral carotid stenosis can increase hemispheric CBF on both sides. Increase of the contralateral CBF is correlated with stenosis grade (\u226550%).", " Endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms can be technically difficult when the neck is wide. The Solitaire AB stent (Covidien, Irvine, California), the only fully retrieved stent, assists in the coiling of wide-neck intracranial aneurysms. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the mid-term angiographic follow-up of wide-necked aneurysms treated with the Solitaire AB stent. METHODS SOLARE (SOLitaire Aneurysm Remodeling) is a consecutive, prospective study conducted in 7 European centers. A core laboratory evaluated the postoperative and mid-term (6 month \u00b1 15 days) angiographic results by using the Raymond classification Scale. Recanalization was defined as worsening, and progressive thrombosis was defined as improvement in the Raymond scale score. RESULTS The mean width of the aneurysm sac was 7.5 mm, and the mean diameter of the aneurysm neck was 4.7 mm. Angiographic mid-term follow-up was obtained in 55 of 65 aneurysms (85.9%). Complete occlusion was achieved in 33 aneurysms (60%); a neck remnant was seen in 16 aneurysms (29.1%) and an aneurysm remnant in 6 aneurysms (10.9%). Of 55 aneurysms, recanalization was observed in 8 aneurysms (14.5%), and progressive thrombosis was observed in 17 aneurysms (30.9%). No bleeding or rebleeding was observed during the follow-up period. CONCLUSION Stent-assisted coiling of wide-necked intracranial aneurysms was found to be safe and effective with the Solitaire AB stent at 6-month follow-up. Angiographic results improve with time due to progressive thrombosis of the aneurysm.", " AND PURPOSE The treatment of cerebral AVMs is complex, reliant on interventions such as embolization, surgery, and radiosurgery, or a combination of these modalities. To date, treatment with the embolic agent Onyx, followed by radiosurgery, has not been evaluated. The goal of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this combination in a homogeneous, monocentric series. MATERIALS AND METHODS From April 2003 to June 2008, a total of 20 patients (11 women and 9 men; age range, 10-55 years) were treated for AVMs with Onyx embolization followed by radiosurgery. AVM sizes were <3 cm in 7 patients and \u22653 cm in 13 patients. Modalities and complications of the procedure were analyzed as well as the long-term clinical and anatomic outcomes (2-5 years after treatment). RESULTS Of 17 patients evaluated by DSA after radiosurgery, 10 (58.8%) were observed to have complete occlusion of the AVM nidus. Complete occlusion was observed in 5 (71.4%) of 7 Spetzler-Martin grade I-II AVMs and in 5 (50.0%) of 10 Spetzler-Martin grade III-IV AVMs. Complete occlusion was observed in 4 (80.0%) of 5 AVMs of <3 cm and 6 (50.0%) of 12 AVMs of >3 cm. One of 20 patients had significant worsening of clinical status (mRS \u22652) at long-term follow-up. CONCLUSIONS In this preliminary series, the safety and efficacy of combined treatment by Onyx embolization followed by radiosurgery are quite satisfactory, with a low rate of clinical complications (5.0%) and a 58.8% rate of complete obliteration of the AVM.", " AND PURPOSE We sought to determine hospital and patient characteristics associated with the use of endovascular therapy for acute ischemic stroke and to analyze trends in clinical outcome. METHODS Data were from Get With The Guidelines-Stroke hospitals from April 1, 2003, to June 30, 2013. We looked at trends in number of hospitals providing endovascular therapy, the use of endovascular therapy in these hospitals and clinical outcomes. We analyzed hospital and patient characteristics associated with endovascular therapy use. RESULTS Of 1087 hospitals, 454 provided endovascular therapy to \u22651 patient in the study period. From 2003 to 2012, proportion of hospitals providing endovascular therapy increased by 1.6% per year (from 12.9% to 28.9%; P<0.0001), with a modest drop to 23.4% in 2013. Utilization of endovascular therapy increased from 0.7% to 2% (P<0.001) with a modest drop to 1.9% in 2013. The overall rate of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage among endovascular therapy treated patients was 9.7%. In multivariable analyses, patient outcomes after endovascular therapy improved over time, with reductions in in-hospital mortality (29.6% in 2004 to 16.2% in 2013; P=0.002); and from late 2010, reduction in symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (11% in 2010 to 5% in 2013; P<0.0001), increased independent ambulation at discharge (24.5% in 2010 to 33% in 2013; P<0.0001) and discharge home (17.7% in 2010 to 26.1% in 2013; P<0.0001). Trends for these outcomes persist in the analyses adjusted for baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale. CONCLUSION The use of endovascular therapy increased modestly nationally from 2003 to 2012 and decreased in 2013. Clinical outcomes improved notably from 2010 to 2013, coincident with more experience and newer thrombectomy devices.", " Hypertension continues to be a major burden of public health concern despite the recent advances and proven benefit of pharmacological therapy. A certain subset of patients has hypertension resistant to maximal medical therapy and appropriate lifestyle measures. A novel catheter-based technique for renal denervation (RDN) as a new therapeutic avenue has great promise for the treatment of refractory hypertension. SUMMARY This review included the physiology of the renal sympathetic nervous system and the renal nerve anatomy. Furthermore, the RDN procedure, technology systems, and RDN clinical trials as well as findings besides antihypertensive effects were discussed. Findings on safety and efficacy seem to suggest that renal sympathetic denervation could be of therapeutic benefit in refractory hypertensive patients. Despite the fast pace of development in RDN therapies, only initial and very limited clinical data are available. Large gaps in knowledge concerning the long-term effects and consequences of RDN still exist, and solid, randomized data are warranted.", "Development of novel antiviral reagents is of great importance for the control of virus spread. Here, Ag2S nanoclusters (NCs) were proved for the first time to possess highly efficient antiviral activity by using porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) as a model of coronavirus. Analyses of virus titers showed that Ag2S NCs significantly suppressed the infection of PEDV by about 3 orders of magnitude at the noncytotoxic concentration at 12 h postinfection, which was further confirmed by the expression of viral proteins. Mechanism investigations indicated that Ag2S NCs treatment inhibits the synthesis of viral negative-strand RNA and viral budding. Ag2S NCs treatment was also found to positively regulate the generation of IFN-stimulating genes (ISGs) and the expression of proinflammation cytokines, which might prevent PEDV infection. This study suggest the novel underlying of Ag2S NCs as a promising therapeutic drug for coronavirus.", "OBJECTIVE: To identify research priorities in the management, epidemiology, outcome and underlying causes of sepsis and septic shock. DESIGN: A consensus committee of 16 international experts representing the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine and Society of Critical Care Medicine was convened at the annual meetings of both societies. Subgroups had teleconference and electronic-based discussion. The entire committee iteratively developed the entire document and recommendations. METHODS: Each committee member independently gave their top five priorities for sepsis research. A total of 88 suggestions (ESM 1 - supplemental table 1) were grouped into categories by the committee co-chairs, leading to the formation of seven subgroups: infection, fluids and vasoactive agents, adjunctive therapy, administration/epidemiology, scoring/identification, post-intensive care unit, and basic/translational science. Each subgroup had teleconferences to go over each priority followed by formal voting within each subgroup. The entire committee also voted on top priorities across all subgroups except for basic/translational science. RESULTS: The Surviving Sepsis Research Committee provides 26 priorities for sepsis and septic shock. Of these, the top six clinical priorities were identified and include the following questions: (1) can targeted/personalized/precision medicine approaches determine which therapies will work for which patients at which times?; (2) what are ideal endpoints for volume resuscitation and how should volume resuscitation be titrated?; (3) should rapid diagnostic tests be implemented in clinical practice?; (4) should empiric antibiotic combination therapy be used in sepsis or septic shock?; (5) what are the predictors of sepsis long-term morbidity and mortality?; and (6) what information identifies organ dysfunction? CONCLUSIONS: While the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines give multiple recommendations on the treatment of sepsis, significant knowledge gaps remain, both in bedside issues directly applicable to clinicians, as well as understanding the fundamental mechanisms underlying the development and progression of sepsis. The priorities identified represent a roadmap for research in sepsis and septic shock. ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL: The online version of this article (10.1007/s00134-018-5175-z) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.", "The authors report a very rare presentation of traumatic carotid-cavernous fistula (CCF) with extensive edema of the basal ganglia and brainstem because of an anatomical variation of the basal vein of Rosenthal (BVR). A 45-year-old woman was admitted to the authors' institution for left hemiparesis, dysarthria, and a comatose state caused by right orbital trauma from a thin metal rod. Brain MRI showed a right CCF and vasogenic edema of the right side of the brainstem, right temporal lobe, and basal ganglia. Digital subtraction angiography confirmed a high-flow direct CCF and revealed a hypoplastic second segment of the BVR responsible for the hypertension in inferior striate veins and venous congestion. Endovascular treatment was performed on an emergency basis. One month after treatment, the patient's symptoms and MRI signal abnormalities almost totally disappeared. Basal ganglia and brainstem venous congestion may occur in traumatic CCF in cases of a hypoplastic or agenetic second segment of the BVR and may provoke emergency treatment.", " Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) is gaining widespread use in the treatment of severe cardiorespiratory failure. Blood volume expansion is commonly used to increase ECMO flow (QECMO), with risk of positive fluid balance and worsening prognosis. We studied the effects of vasoconstriction on recruitment of blood volume as an alternative for increasing QECMO, based on the concepts of venous return. METHODS In a closed chest, centrally cannulated porcine preparation (n = 9) in ventricular fibrillation and VA-ECMO with vented left atrium, mean systemic filling pressure (MSFP), and venous return driving pressure (VRdP) were determined in Euvolemia, during Vasoconstriction (norepinephrine 0.05, 0.125, and 0.2 \u03bcg/kg/min) and after Volume Expansion (3 boluses of 10 mL/kg Ringer's lactate). Maximum achievable QECMO was examined. RESULTS Vasoconstriction and Volume Expansion both increased maximum achievable QECMO, delivery of oxygen (DO2), and MSFP, but right atrial pressure increased in parallel. VRdP did not change. The vascular elastance curve was shifted to the left by Vasoconstriction, with recruitment of stressed volume. It was shifted to the right by Volume Expansion with direct expansion of stressed volume. Volume Expansion decreased resistance to venous return and pump afterload. CONCLUSIONS In a circulation completely dependent on ECMO support, maximum achievable flow directly depended on the vascular factors governing venous return-i.e., closing conditions, stressed vascular volume and the elastance and resistive properties of the vasculature. Both treatments increased maximum achievable ECMO flow at stable DO2, via increases in stressed volume by different mechanisms. Vascular resistance and pump afterload decreased with Volume Expansion.", "Dengue is an important public health problem in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Neither vaccine nor an antiviral medication is available to treat dengue. This insists the need of drug discovery for dengue. In order to find a potent lead molecule, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase which is essential for dengue viral replication is chosen as a drug target. As Quercetin showed antiviral activity against several viruses, quercetin derivatives developed by combinatorial library synthesis and mined from PubChem databases were screened for a potent anti-dengue viral agent. Our study predicted Quercetin 3-(6\u2033-(E)-p-coumaroylsophoroside)-7-rhamnoside as a dengue polymerase inhibitor. The results were validated by molecular dynamics simulation studies which reveal water bridges and hydrogen bonds as major contributors for the stability of the polymerase-lead complex. Interactions formed by this compound with residues Trp795, Arg792 and Glu351 are found to be essential for the stability of the polymerase-lead complex. Our study demonstrates Quercetin 3-(6\u2033-(E)-p-coumaroylsophoroside)-7-rhamnoside as a potent non-nucleoside inhibitor for dengue polymerase.", "OBJECTIVE The main concern during transfemoral carotid artery stenting (CAS) is preventing cerebral embolus dislodgement. We compared clinical outcomes and intraprocedural embolization rates of CAS using a distal filter protection device or proximal balloon occlusion device. METHODS From January 2011 to March 2015, a series of 58 patients with symptomatic or asymptomatic internal carotid artery stenosis \u226570% were treated with CAS with embolic protection device in single center. All patients underwent post-CAS diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) to detect new ischemic lesions. We compared clinical outcomes and postprocedural embolization rates. RESULTS CAS was performed in all 61 patients. Distal filter protection success rate was 96.6% (28/29), whose mean age was 70.9 years, and mean stenosis was 81%. Their preprocedural infarction rate was 39% (11/28). Subsequent DW-MRI revealed 96 new ischemic lesions in 71% (20/28) patients. In contrast, the proximal balloon occlusion device success rate was 93.8% (30/32), whose mean age was 68.8 years and mean stenosis was 86%. Preprocedure infarction rate was 47% (14/30). DW-MRI revealed 45 new ischemic lesions in 57% (17/30) patients. Compared with distal filter protection device, proximal balloon occlusion device resulted in fewer ischemic lesions per patient (p=0.028). In each group, type of stent during CAS had no significant effect on number of periprocedural embolisms. Only 2 neurologic events occurred in the successfully treated patients (one from each group). CONCLUSION Transfemoral CAS with proximal balloon occlusion device achieves good results. Compared with distal filter protection, proximal balloon occlusion might be more effective in reducing cerebral embolism during CAS.", "OBJECTIVES Few studies have assessed the effect of gender on remission rates after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of Barrett's esophagus (BE). We aim to assess the effect of gender on the time to achieve complete remission of intestinal metaplasia (CRIM) among patients with BE, who underwent RFA. METHODS This was a retrospective, observational study using a large RFA database in a tertiary referral center. The primary outcome was time to CRIM compared between males and females. Covariates included age, race, smoking history, use of endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR), histology before RFA, and the number of RFA sessions. Time to CRIM (in months) was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. Multivariable Cox-proportional hazard models were used to assess for any association between time to CRIM and gender. RESULTS Two hundred and fifty-seven patients, 11% (n=23) female, underwent RFA for BE between May 2005 and June 2012. Males and females were similar in mean age, race, smoking history, median BE length, history of EMR, and baseline histology. Median time to CRIM for females was longer than males (24 months (95% confidence interval (CI): 10.3-60.2) vs. 11.7 months (95% CI: 10-15), P=0.03). Using Cox-regression analysis, controlling for age, use of EMR, BE segment length, and the number of RFA sessions, female gender was associated with a 55% decrease in the rate of CRIM compared with that in males (hazard ratio=0.45 (95% CI: 0.25-0.82), P=0.009). CONCLUSIONS Females take longer time to achieve CRIM when treated with RFA when compared with males of similar age and BE length.", "PURPOSE To prospectively assess current limitations and complication rates of the transbrachial access technique for endovascular treatment of peripheral vascular pathologies. METHODS In total, 150 patients (112 men; mean age 66.3 \u00b1 10.0 years) with arterial occlusive disease underwent endovascular therapy via a transbrachial access. Periprocedure data (sheath size, dose area product, fluoroscopy time, and procedure duration) were analyzed. Postprocedure complications of the puncture sites were categorized as minor (local hematoma, pseudoaneurysm, embolization, dissection, minor bleeding) and major (thrombotic occlusion, hematoma requiring surgery, major bleeding, nerve injury). RESULTS The minor and major complication rates were 14.0% (n = 21) and 2.7% (n = 4). The most frequent major complication was thrombotic occlusion of the brachial artery requiring surgical treatment (3/150, 2%). There was only one temporary palsy of the median nerve and no stroke. Local hematoma (15, 10%), pseudoaneurysm (3, 2%), or a combination of both (3, 2%) dominated the minor complications. The average dose area product and fluoroscopy time were 12,752.1 \u00b1 9524.5 cGy*cm(2) and 24.3 \u00b1 18.4 minutes, respectively, though procedure duration was acceptable (121.8 \u00b1 48.9 minutes). CONCLUSION Complication rates of the transbrachial access for endovascular treatment of peripheral or visceral artery occlusive disease are tolerably low, making it a safe and an important alternative to the transfemoral access in selected cases, though the radiation exposure is rather high.", " AND PURPOSE Flat panel detector CT in the angiography suite may be valuable for the detection of intracranial hematomas; however, abnormal contrast enhancement frequently mimics hemorrhage. We aimed to assess the accuracy of flat panel detector CT in detecting/excluding intracranial bleeding after endovascular stroke therapy and whether it was able to reliably differentiate hemorrhage from early blood-brain barrier disruption. MATERIALS AND METHODS Seventy-three patients were included for retrospective evaluation following endovascular stroke therapy: 32 after stent-assisted thrombectomy, 14 after intra-arterial thrombolysis, and 27 after a combination of both. Flat panel CT images were assessed for image quality and the presence and type of intracranial hemorrhage and BBB disruption by 2 readers separately and in consensus. Follow-up by multisection head CT, serving as the reference standard, was evaluated by a single reader. RESULTS Conventional head CT revealed intracranial hematomas in 12 patients (8 subarachnoid hemorrhages, 7 cases of intracerebral bleeding, 3 SAHs plus intracerebral bleeding). Image quality of flat panel detector CT was considered sufficient in all cases supratentorially and in 92% in the posterior fossa. Regarding detection or exclusion of intracranial hemorrhage, flat panel detector CT reached a sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy of 58%, 85%, 44%, 91%, and 81%, respectively. Maximum attenuation measurements were not valuable for the differentiation of hemorrhage and BBB disruption. CONCLUSIONS Flat panel CT after endovascular stroke treatment was able to exclude the rare event of an intracranial hemorrhage with a high negative predictive value. Future studies should evaluate the predictive value of BBB disruptions in flat panel detector CT for the development of relevant hematomas.", " Obesity is a major health concern in the Middle East and worldwide. It is among the leading causes of morbidity, mortality, health care utilization, and costs. With bariatric surgery proving to be a more effective treatment option for overweight and obesity, the need for systematic assessment of different procedures and their outcomes becomes necessary. These procedures have not yet been described in detail in our region. OBJECTIVE We aim to undertake a prospective study evaluating and comparing several surgical bariatric procedures in an Iranian population of morbid obese patients presenting to a specialized bariatric center. METHODS In order to facilitate and accelerate understanding of obesity and its complications, the Tehran Obesity Treatment Study (TOTS) was planned and developed. This study is a longitudinal prospective cohort study in consecutive patients undergoing bariatric surgery. TOTS investigators use standardized definitions, high-fidelity data collection system, and validated instruments to gather data preoperatively, at the time of surgery, postoperatively, and in longer-term follow-up. RESULTS This study has recruited 1050 participants as of September 2015 and is ongoing. CONCLUSIONS This study will ensure creation of high-level evidence to enable clinicians to make meaningful evidence-based decisions for patient evaluation, selection for surgery, and follow-up care.", " Ethmoidal dural arteriovenous fistulas (dAVFs) have a malignant natural history and an anatomy that make endovascular therapy challenging. Their uniqueness begs for stratified analyses, but this has largely been precluded by their rarity. We sought to summarize the anatomic, presentation, treatment approaches, and clinical outcomes of patients with these lesions. METHODS We reviewed our prospectively maintained institutional database to identify patients diagnosed with ethmoidal dAVFs from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2015. We evaluated demographic, presentation, angiographic, treatment, and follow-up data. RESULTS In total, 27 patients with ethmoidal dAVFs underwent endovascular and/or surgical treatment. Mean patient age was 62 years old and there was a male sex predilection (67% men; 2:1 male-female ratio). All dAVFs exhibited direct cortical venous drainage; venous ectasia was present in 59% of cases. Of the dAVFs, 30% drained posteriorly into the basal vein of Rosenthal or the sylvian veins. Embolization with casting of the draining vein was successful in 2 of 9 cases (22%), including 1 successful transvenous case. There were no clinical or permanent complications from embolization; specifically, no patients experienced visual loss after treatment. Surgical treatment with successful dAVF obliteration was carried out in 24 of 24 patients (100%). One patient declined surgical treatment after attempted endovascular embolization. There were no permanent complications after surgical treatment and no cases of wound infection or cerebrospinal fluid leakage. CONCLUSIONS Surgical disconnection remains the gold standard in the treatment of ethmoidal dAVFs. Embolization is a consideration for well-selected cases with favorable arterial or venous access anatomy.", " A novel highly pathogenic human coronavirus able to induce severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been recently recognized as the cause of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, which has spread rapidly from China to other countries. Little is known about laboratory prognostic markers in COVID-19 patients. The aim of our study was to describe the basic clotting parameters in COVID-19 patients and their prognostic role in different clinical forms of the disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS We enrolled 67 COVID-19 patients admitted to the Emergency Department. A cohort of 67 age- and sex-matched non-COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory illness was used as a control group. For all patients, platelet count (PLT), prothrombin time (PT), activated thromboplastin time (aPTT), C-reactive protein (PCR), fibrinogen, and D-dimer were determined. The COVID-19 population was divided in two groups according to the presence or absence of SARS. The clotting factors values were compared between the groups. RESULTS At admission, the COVID-19 patients showed statistically significant increased levels of fibrinogen (601.5 (480-747) vs. 455 (352.5-588.5) mg/dL; p = 0.0000064), and a higher percentage of patients had fibrinogen levels >400 mg/dL (86% vs.58%; p = 0.0054) compared to the control group. The levels of fibrinogen were higher in COVID-19 patients with SARS compared to those without SARS (747 (600.0-834.0) vs. 567 (472.5-644.50); p = 0.0003). CONCLUSION Fibrinogen seems to increase early in COVID-19 patients and may be used as a risk stratification marker for the early detection of a subgroup of COVID-19 patient at increased risk to develop SARS, who might benefit from a different and thorough clinical surveillance and treatment.", "OBJECTIVE To compare analgesic and gastrointestinal effects of lidocaine and buprenorphine administered to rabbits undergoing ovariohysterectomy. ANIMALS Fourteen 12-month-old female New Zealand White rabbits. PROCEDURES Rabbits were assigned to 2 treatment groups (7 rabbits/group). One group received buprenorphine (0.06 mg/kg, IV, q 8 h for 2 days), and the other received lidocaine (continuous rate infusion [CRI] at 100 \u03bcg/kg/min for 2 days). Variables, including food and water consumption, fecal output, glucose and cortisol concentrations, and behaviors while in exercise pens, were recorded. RESULTS Rabbits receiving a lidocaine CRI had significantly higher gastrointestinal motility, food intake, and fecal output and significantly lower glucose concentrations, compared with results for rabbits receiving buprenorphine. Rabbits receiving lidocaine also had a higher number of normal behaviors (eg, sprawling, traveling, and frolicking) after surgery, compared with behaviors such as crouching and sitting that were seen more commonly in rabbits receiving buprenorphine. Both groups had significant weight loss after surgery. Pain scores did not differ significantly between treatment groups. Significant decreases in heart rate and respiratory rate were observed on the day of surgery, compared with values before and after surgery. Rabbits in the lidocaine group had significantly overall lower heart rates than did rabbits in the buprenorphine group. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE A CRI of lidocaine to rabbits provided better postoperative outcomes with respect to fecal output, food intake, and glucose concentrations. Thus, lidocaine appeared to be a suitable alternative to buprenorphine for alleviating postoperative pain with minimal risk of anorexia and gastrointestinal ileus.", " Incisional and ventral hernias are common surgical indications. Their management is associated with significant complications and recurrences in open surgery (15-25%). Since laparoscopy has become a standard in bariatric surgery, there has been a natural trend to treat obese patients with parietal wall defects laparoscopically. The aim of our study was to evaluate the feasibility and the results of the laparoscopic management of parietal wall defects in patients with a BMI >35. MATERIALS AND METHODS A series of 79 patients were included. Data were acquired prospectively and analyzed retrospectively. The surgical procedure was standardized: 3 ports, mesh type (Parietex\u2122 Composite mesh, Covidien, France), fixation with non-absorbable transfascial sutures, and tackers. Complications were evaluated. RESULTS Out of 79 patients (29 men, 50 women), 43 had umbilical and 36 had ventral hernias. Mean age was 52.4 years, and mean BMI was 40.83 kg/m(2). Mean postoperative hospital stay was 2 days. Postoperative pain evaluated by visual analog scale was 2.86. No intraoperative complications or deaths occurred. Seven postoperative complications occurred (8.86%): two parietal wall hematomas treated by radiological embolization, two significant cases of postoperative pain, one postoperative obstruction, one spontaneously resolved respiratory failure, and one early (day 1) parietal wall defect with immediate reoperation. Postoperative seroma rate was 26.58% (21 patients, all of whom were treated conservatively). Postoperative follow-up was 18.10 months (1-84 months), and recurrence rate was 3.8% (3 patients). DISCUSSION This study confirms the feasibility and safety of the laparoscopic approach for ventral hernias in morbidly obese patients. Recurrence rates (3.8%) appeared lower than the ones observed in the literature (15-25%). Postoperative hemorrhage and port-site hernia are specific complications of this approach. Postoperative hospital stay is low (2 days) as compared to open surgery. Laparoscopic management of parietal wall defects should be considered a standard option in morbidly obese patients.", " Long-term outcome data are needed to define the role of bariatric surgery in type 2 diabetes (T2D). To address this, we collated diabetes outcomes more than a decade after laparoscopic adjustable gastric band (LAGB) surgery. METHOD Clinical and biochemical measures from 113 obese T2D patients who underwent LAGB surgery in 2003 and 2004 were analyzed. Diabetes remission was defined as HbA1c < 6.2% (44 mmol/mol) and fasting glucose < 7.0 mmol/L. RESULTS Seventy-nine patients had weight data at 10 years and attained a median [Q1, Q3] weight loss of 16 [10, 21] percent. Sixty patients attended a follow-up assessment. Their baseline HbA1c of 7.8 [7.1, 9.3] percentage units (62 [54, 78] mmol/mol) had decreased to 6.6 [6.1, 8.4] (49 [43, 68] mmol/mol) despite no significant change in glucose-lowering therapy. Eleven patients (18%) were in diabetes remission and another 18 had HbA1c \u2264 6.5%. Significant improvements in physical measures of quality of life, blood pressure, and lipid profile were also observed but there was no change in the proportion of patients with albuminuria and a significant decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate. Twelve patients in the follow-up cohort (20%) required anti-reflux medication after surgery and 26 (43%) underwent gastric band revision surgery. CONCLUSION Weight loss for over 10 years after LAGB surgery delivers clinically meaningful improvements in HbA1c, blood pressure, lipids, and quality of life at the cost of a high rate of revision surgery and increased use of anti-reflux medication. These findings support the use of bariatric surgery as a long-term treatment for weight loss and wellbeing in patients with T2D. STUDY REGISTRATION Registered with the Australian Clinical trials registry as ACTRN12615000089538.", ": Patients with oncologic diseases, particularly those with hematologic malignancies, are at an increased risk of common infections and unique treatment-related complications with high mortality and morbidity. The annual incidence and prevalence of cancer in Germany is rising. Although modern treatments have generally led to improved survival, increasing age, comorbidities, and frailty of the patients require multidisciplinary strategies for handling complex therapeutic concepts and treatment of the associated complications. METHODS: A selective literature search and guidelines from the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO), the German Society of Hematology and Medical Oncology (Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr H\u00e4matologie und Medizinische Onkologie, DGHO), the Infectious Diseases Working Group of the DGHO (Arbeitsgemeinschaft Infektionen in der H\u00e4matologie und Onkologie, AGIHO), and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) formed the basis of this study. CONCLUSION: Recognition of severe infections in cancer patients and their discrimination from treatment-associated complications is a challenge. Neutropenic fever is the most frequent infectious emergency in oncology. Early empiric treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics and escalated diagnostic strategies are needed to successfully treat this vulnerable patient group. In this article, a range of potentially life-threatening infections in immunocompromised patients are discussed.", "OBJECTIVE To describe a standing laparoscopic peritoneal flap hernioplasty (PFH) technique for closure of the vaginal ring, and to evaluate its effect on prevention of recurrent herniation in stallions, previously treated for acquired strangulating inguinal hernia (SIH). STUDY DESIGN Case series. ANIMALS Stallions (n = 30) aged 3-15 that had previous acquired SIH. METHODS Bilateral standing laparoscopic PFH was performed on 30 stallions that had previous acquired SIH treated without castration. The vaginal rings were approached from 3 portals, 2 in the paralumbar fossa and a 3rd between the 17th and 18th ribs on the ipsilateral side. A large inverted U-shaped peritoneal flap was dissected from the abdominal wall proximal and cranial to the vaginal ring, reflected caudally over the vaginal ring, and secured to the abdominal wall with laparoscopic staples. In the first 11 stallions, only the cranial and mid third of the vaginal ring was covered. For the next 19 stallions, complete closure of the vaginal ring including the entire caudal aspect of the vaginal ring was achieved. RESULTS SIH recurrence occurred in 4 of 11 stallions with incomplete ring closure whereas no SIH recurrence occurred when the entire vaginal ring was closed. No major complications occurred and cosmetic outcome was excellent. All breeding stallions were successfully used for breeding. CONCLUSION Standing laparoscopic closure of the vaginal ring using a PFH is an effective way to prevent recurrence of SIH provided the entire vaginal ring, including the caudal aspect is covered by the flap. There seems to be no effect on subsequent fertility.", " Proximal middle cerebral artery (M1 segment) aneurysms are relatively deeply located in neighboring lenticulostriate arteries, which make them unsuitable for microsurgery. We aimed to investigate the clinical and radiological outcomes of endovascular coiling of M1 segment aneurysms. METHODS Between January 2003 and December 2014, we retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 52 patients (52 aneurysms) from four institutions who underwent endovascular coiling of M1 segment aneurysms. Patients who underwent clinical and radiologic follow-up for more than a year after the procedure were evaluated. RESULTS The aneurysms were located in the early frontal branch, early temporal branch, and lenticulostriate artery in 28, 15, and nine patients, respectively. Endovascular coiling was achieved in 51 cases and failed in one case. Of these 51 cases, 46 (90.2%) and five (9.8%) were non-ruptured and ruptured aneurysms, respectively. Initial angiographic results revealed complete occlusion in 26 (51.0%), residual neck in 16 (31.4%), and residual sac in nine (17.6%) cases. One failed case had a symptomatic procedural complication of thromboembolism. However, there was no permanent morbidity or mortality. Two major recanalization cases (3.9%) were retreated by endovascular coiling. On multivariable logistic regression analysis, aneurysmal recurrence was significantly related to aneurysm height (OR, 1.887; 95% CI, 1.107 to 3.217; p = 0.020), width (OR, 1.836; CI, 1.127 to 2.992; p = 0.015), and neck (OR, 4.017; CI, 1.220 to 13.232, p = 0.022). CONCLUSION Endovascular coiling of M1 segment aneurysms appeared to be a feasible treatment option with a relatively low-retreatment rate. Aneurysm size was statistically significantly associated with recurrence.", "Importance The positive treatment effect of endovascular therapy (EVT) is assumed to be caused by the preservation of brain tissue. It remains unclear to what extent the treatment-related reduction in follow-up infarct volume (FIV) explains the improved functional outcome after EVT in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Objective To study whether FIV mediates the relationship between EVT and functional outcome in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Design, Setting, and Participants Patient data from 7 randomized multicenter trials were pooled. These trials were conducted between December 2010 and April 2015 and included 1764 patients randomly assigned to receive either EVT or standard care (control). Follow-up infarct volume was assessed on computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging after stroke onset. Mediation analysis was performed to examine the potential causal chain in which FIV may mediate the relationship between EVT and functional outcome. A total of 1690 patients met the inclusion criteria. Twenty-five additional patients were excluded, resulting in a total of 1665 patients, including 821 (49.3%) in the EVT group and 844 (50.7%) in the control group. Data were analyzed from January to June 2017. Main Outcome and Measure The 90-day functional outcome via the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Results Among 1665 patients, the median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 68 (57-76) years, and 781 (46.9%) were female. The median (IQR) time to FIV measurement was 30 (24-237) hours. The median (IQR) FIV was 41 (14-120) mL. Patients in the EVT group had significantly smaller FIVs compared with patients in the control group (median [IQR] FIV, 33 [11-99] vs 51 [18-134] mL; P = .007) and lower mRS scores at 90 days (median [IQR] score, 3 [1-4] vs 4 [2-5]). Follow-up infarct volume was a predictor of functional outcome (adjusted common odds ratio, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.39-0.54; P < .001). Follow-up infarct volume partially mediated the relationship between treatment type with mRS score, as EVT was still significantly associated with functional outcome after adjustment for FIV (adjusted common odds ratio, 2.22; 95% CI, 1.52-3.21; P < .001). Treatment-reduced FIV explained 12% (95% CI, 1-19) of the relationship between EVT and functional outcome. Conclusions and Relevance In this analysis, follow-up infarct volume predicted functional outcome; however, a reduced infarct volume after treatment with EVT only explained 12% of the treatment benefit. Follow-up infarct volume as measured on computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging is not a valid proxy for estimating treatment effect in phase II and III trials of acute ischemic stroke.", "Importance Effective long-term treatments are needed to address the obesity epidemic. Numerous wearable technologies specific to physical activity and diet are available, but it is unclear if these are effective at improving weight loss. Objective To test the hypothesis that, compared with a standard behavioral weight loss intervention (standard intervention), a technology-enhanced weight loss intervention (enhanced intervention) would result in greater weight loss. Design, Setting, Participants Randomized clinical trial conducted at the University of Pittsburgh and enrolling 471 adult participants between October 2010 and October 2012, with data collection completed by December 2014. Interventions Participants were placed on a low-calorie diet, prescribed increases in physical activity, and had group counseling sessions. At 6 months, the interventions added telephone counseling sessions, text message prompts, and access to study materials on a website. At 6 months, participants randomized to the standard intervention group initiated self-monitoring of diet and physical activity using a website, and those randomized to the enhanced intervention group were provided with a wearable device and accompanying web interface to monitor diet and physical activity. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome of weight was measured over 24 months at 6-month intervals, and the primary hypothesis tested the change in weight between 2 groups at 24 months. Secondary outcomes included body composition, fitness, physical activity, and dietary intake. Results Among the 471 participants randomized (body mass index [BMI], 25 to <40; age range, 18-35 years; 28.9% nonwhite, 77.2% women), 470 (233 in the standard intervention group, 237 in the enhanced intervention group) initiated the interventions as randomized, and 74.5% completed the study. For the enhanced intervention group, mean base line weight was 96.3 kg (95% CI, 94.2-98.5) and 24-month weight 92.8 kg (95% CI, 90.6- 95.0) [corrected]. For the standard intervention group, mean baseline weight was 95.2kg (95%CI,93.0-97.3)and24-month weight was 89.3 kg (95%CI, 87.1-91.5) [corrected]. Weight change at 24 months differed significantly by intervention group (estimated mean weight loss, 3.5 kg [95% CI, 2.6-4.5} in the enhanced intervention group and 5.9 kg [95% CI, 5.0-6.8] in the standard intervention group; difference, 2.4 kg [95% CI, 1.0-3.7]; P = .002). Both groups had significant improvements in body composition, fitness, physical activity, and diet, with no significant difference between groups. Conclusions and Relevance Among young adults with a BMI between 25 and less than 40, the addition of a wearable technology device to a standard behavioral intervention resulted in less weight loss over 24 months. Devices that monitor and provide feedback on physical activity may not offer an advantage over standard behavioral weight loss approaches. Trial Registration clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01131871.", "The envelope spike (S) glycoprotein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) mediates the entry of the virus into target cells. Recent studies point out to a cell entry mechanism of this virus similar to other enveloped viruses, such as HIV-1. As it happens with other viruses peptidic fusion inhibitors, SARS-CoV S protein HR2-derived peptides are potential therapeutic drugs against the virus. It is believed that HR2 peptides block the six-helix bundle formation, a key structure in the viral fusion, by interacting with the HR1 region. It is a matter of discussion if the HIV-1 gp41 HR2-derived peptide T20 (enfuvirtide) could be a possible SARS-CoV inhibitor given the similarities between the two viruses. We tested the possibility of interaction between both T20 (HIV-1 gp41 HR2-derived peptide) and T-1249 with S protein HR1- and HR2-derived peptides. Our biophysical data show a significant interaction between a SARS-CoV HR1-derived peptide and T20. However, the interaction is only moderate (K(B) = (1.1 \u00b1 0.3) \u00d7 10(5) M(\u22121)). This finding shows that the reasoning behind the hypothesis that T20, already approved for clinical application in AIDS treatment, could inhibit the fusion of SARS-CoV with target cells is correct but the effect may not be strong enough for application.", "Situs inversus totalis is a rare congenital anomaly in which the major abdominal organs are located as a mirror image of their normal positions. This poses much difficulty for surgeons. We describe how we performed the liver-hanging maneuver (LHM) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a 59-year-old man with situs inversus totalis, to resolve the difficulty of the mirror-image location of his liver. The HCC was located in the right lateral sector. Although segmentectomy of segment 7 would normally be considered minimal for a curative treatment of HCC, this was relatively complicated in this patient. Thus, we performed an extended right lateral sectionectomy using the LHM to achieve a simple transection. The hepatic hilum was dissected using the Glissonean pedicle transection method. The operation time and intraoperative blood loss were 6 h 45 min and 471 ml, respectively. No blood product transfusion was required. The LHM and the hilar Glissonean pedicle approach proved effective for resolving the difficulties of performing surgery in a mirror image for HCC in a patient with situs inversus totalis.", "PURPOSE To assess the efficacy of percutaneous thermal ablation in treating colorectal cancer liver metastases (CRCLM), and to propose a prognostic nomogram for overall survival (OS). MATERIALS AND METHODS Seventy-one patients with CRCLM undergoing thermal ablation at our institute from 2009 to 2013 were identified and analysed to formulate a prognostic nomogram. The concordance index (C-index) and calibration curve were calculated to evaluate the predictive accuracy of the nomogram. The nomogram was compared with two current prognostic nomograms for patients with CRCLM who had undergone hepatectomy (Kattan) and selective internal radiation therapy (Fendler). Predictive validity was assessed in the validation cohort of 25 patients who had undergone thermal ablation from 2014 to 2016. RESULTS The median OS in the primary cohort was 26.4 months, whereas the 1-, 3- and 5-year OS rates were 72.2%, 37.2% and 17%, respectively. The median progression-free survival was 4.2 months. After univariate and multivariate analysis, a prognostic nomogram was formulated based on four predictors, including the number of tumours, maximum diameter of the tumour, CA19-9 level and ablation margin. The C-index of the nomogram was 0.815. Based on the patients of this study, the C-index was significantly higher than that of the Fendler nomogram (C-index, 0.698) and Kattan nomogram (C-index, 0.514, p < 0.001). Predictive accuracy of the proposed nomogram was also satisfactory in the validation cohort, with a C-index of 0.884. CONCLUSIONS Thermal ablation was an effective therapy for CRCLM. Moreover, the nomogram was effective and simple for CRCLM patients undergoing thermal ablation.", "As COVID-19 disease escalates globally, optimising patient outcome during this catastrophic health care crisis is the number one priority. The principles of patient blood management are fundamental strategies to improve patient outcomes and should be given high priority in this crisis situation. The aim of this expert review is to provide clinicians and health care authorities with information regarding how to apply established principles of patient blood management during the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, this review considers the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the blood supply and specifies important aspects of donor management. We further discuss how preventative and control measures implemented during the COVID-19 crisis could affect the prevalence of anaemia, and highlight issues regarding the diagnosis and treatment of anaemia in patients requiring elective or emergency surgery. In addition, we review aspects related to patient blood management of critically ill patients with known or suspected COVID-19, and discuss important alterations of the coagulation system in patients hospitalised due to COVID-19. Finally, we address special considerations pertaining to supply-demand and cost-benefit issues of patient blood management during the COVID-19 pandemic.", "The 2015 update of the Canadian Stroke Best Practice Recommendations Hyperacute Stroke Care guideline highlights key elements involved in the initial assessment, stabilization, and treatment of patients with transient ischemic attack (TIA), ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and acute venous sinus thrombosis. The most notable change in this 5th edition is the addition of new recommendations for the use of endovascular therapy for patients with acute ischemic stroke and proximal intracranial arterial occlusion. This includes an overview of the infrastructure and resources required for stroke centers that will provide endovascular therapy as well as regional structures needed to ensure that all patients with acute ischemic stroke that are eligible for endovascular therapy will be able to access this newly approved therapy; recommendations for hyperacute brain and enhanced vascular imaging using computed tomography angiography and computed tomography perfusion; patient selection criteria based on the five trials of endovascular therapy published in early 2015, and performance metric targets for important time-points involved in endovascular therapy, including computed tomography-to-groin puncture and computed tomography-to-reperfusion times. Other updates in this guideline include recommendations for improved time efficiencies for all aspects of hyperacute stroke care with a movement toward a new median target door-to-needle time of 30 min, with the 90th percentile being 60 min. A stronger emphasis is placed on increasing public awareness of stroke with the recent launch of the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada FAST signs of stroke campaign; reinforcing the public need to seek immediate medical attention by calling 911; further engagement of paramedics in the prehospital phase with prehospital notification to the receiving emergency department, as well as the stroke team, including neuroradiology; updates to the triage and same-day assessment of patients with transient ischemic attack; updates to blood pressure recommendations for the hyperacute phase of care for ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, and subarachnoid hemorrhage. The goal of these recommendations and supporting materials is to improve efficiencies and minimize the absolute time lapse between stroke symptom onset and reperfusion therapy, which in turn leads to better outcomes and potentially shorter recovery times.", " Flow diverters are increasingly used for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms. Understanding cavernous internal carotid artery (cICA) tortuosity may help to predict procedural complexities of deploying flow diverters. METHODS Pipeline embolization device (PED) neurointerventions for ICA aneurysms proximal to the ICA termination were reviewed. Cavernous ICA tortuosity was measured as a ratio D/AP, where D=height difference of the anterior and posterior genus, AP=sum of the angles of the anterior (A) and posterior (P) genus. Four types of cICA tortuosity were proposed. An analysis of variance regression and Fisher's exact test were performed to analyze differences among the types. RESULTS Cavernous ICA tortuosity was categorized into minimal (type I, n=28), moderate (type II-III, n=29), and severe (type IV, n=26). The groups were comparable for patient age (mean \u00b1 SEM years, type I: 55.6\u00b110.4, II-III: 56.4\u00b114.4, IV: 55\u00b112.8) and aneurysm size (mean\u00b1SEM mm, type I: 6.25\u00b13.5, II-III: 7.6\u00b14.9, IV: 9.11\u00b14.9). Analysis of variance demonstrated significant differences in procedural fluoroscopy time (mean \u00b1 SEM min, type I: 29.8\u00b18.4, II-III: 44.9\u00b134.1, IV: 52.6\u00b117.2, p<0.005) and mean \u00b1 SEM D/AP (type I: 0.008\u00b10.0008, II-III: 0.141\u00b10.07, IV: 0.482\u00b10.365, p<0.0001). Procedural complexity was also statistically significant (p<0.005) with 4%, 28%, and 35% of cases in types I, II-III, and IV, respectively, requiring intraprocedural PED removal or balloon post-processing of the implanted PED. CONCLUSIONS We propose a classification system for cICA tortuosity based on measurements of the anterior and posterior genu geometry. This classification correlates strongly with markers of PED procedural complexity and may be helpful in pre-procedure prognostication.", "Importance A succession of research has explored the linkage between carotid webs (CaWs) and ischemic strokes. Imaging and pathologic analysis have defined CaW as an intimal variant of fibromuscular dysplasia, which appears as a shelflike lesion on the posterior aspect of the carotid bulb, more specifically at the origin of internal carotid artery. Reported findings of carotid webs in young patients with recurrent ischemic strokes without an otherwise determined cause have raised questions about the mechanism, natural history, and need for intervention. This review addresses the current understanding of CaW and highlights findings that prompt further investigation into this unique vascular entity as a modifiable stroke risk factor. Observations Imaging analysis demonstrates hemodynamic disturbance in the presence of CaWs. The protuberant shelflike structure creates a pocket therein that may subsequently lead to local thrombosis and cerebral embolism. Computed tomographic angiography is an accurate and often used noninvasive diagnostic modality. Although treatment paradigms have not been systematically evaluated, antiplatelet monotherapy may not be sufficient to reduce recurrent ischemic events in the small series of patients with stroke and symptomatic CaWs. Conclusions and Relevance The limited clinical data on CaWs, although complicated by selection bias, suggest an increased prevalence of these vascular entities in cerebral ischemic events among patients younger than 60 years. Imaging suggests CaW to be a possible nidus for cerebral thromboembolism. Physicians should consider CaW as a cause of stroke in younger patients with anterior circulation ischemic strokes of an otherwise undetermined cause. Treatment options in CaWs with ischemic strokes have not been extensively investigated. Multicenter observational studies evaluating the natural history of CaW are warranted.", "Based on the serious problem of health care-associated infections and the understanding that patient crosscontamination is essentially preventable, opinions were sought from health care providers for insight into likely sources of crosscontamination in US hospitals, probable causes, and areas for additional investigation. Respondents indicated that inadequate disinfection of noncritical, patient care devices pose an underrecognized threat to patient crosscontamination. This led the researchers to question reliance upon the current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities for such items. The CDC Guideline follows the Spaulding approach, which categorizes items and their disinfection treatment based on the risk of infection from the intended use of the item. A failure modes, effects, and criticality analysis approach is recommended as an additional refinement to the CDC Guideline whereby likely sources of cross-contamination are identified irrespective of intended use. Enhancing infection control practices with this approach promotes the development of preventive plans for cleaning and disinfection that can mitigate such risk.", "Ischemic heart failure caused by atherosclerosis is a major cause of death worldwide. Although remarkable technological advances have been made in the treatment of coronary heart disease, there is as yet no treatment that can sufficiently suppress the progression of atherosclerosis, including neointimal thickening. Therefore, a precise understanding of the mechanism of neointimal hyperplasia will provide the development of new technologies. Both ApoE-KO and LDLR-KO mice have been employed to generate other relevant mouse models of cardiovascular disease through breeding strategies. Although these mice are effective tools for the investigation of atherosclerosis, development of a progressive atherosclerotic lesion takes a long time, resulting in increase of both the costs and the space needed for the research. Thus, it is necessary to develop simpler tools that would allow easy evaluation of atherosclerosis in mouse models. In this review, we discuss our experience in generating mouse models of cuff-induced injury of the femoral artery and attempt to provide a better understanding of cuff-induced neointimal formation.", "Equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1) is a major cause of infectious respiratory disease, abortion and neurologic disease. Thrombosis in placental and spinal vessels and subsequent ischemic injury in EHV-1-infected horses manifests clinically as abortion and myeloencephalopathy. We have previously shown that addition of heparin anticoagulants to equine platelet-rich plasma (PRP) can abolish ex vivo EHV-1-induced platelet activation. The goal of this study was to test whether platelets isolated from horses treated with unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) were resistant to ex vivo EHV-1-induced activation. In a masked, block-randomized placebo-controlled cross-over trial, 9 healthy adult horses received 4 subcutaneous injections at q. 12 h intervals of one of the following treatments: UFH (100 U/kg loading dose, 3 maintenance doses of 80 U/kg), 2 doses of LMWH (enoxaparin) 80 U/kg 24 h apart with saline at the intervening 12 h intervals, or 4 doses of saline. Blood samples were collected before treatment and after 36 h, 40 h (4 h after the last injection) and 60 h (24 h after the last injection). Two strains of EHV-1, Ab4 and RacL11, were added to PRP ex vivo and platelet membrane expression of P selectin was measured as a marker of platelet activation. Drug concentrations were monitored in a Factor Xa inhibition (anti-Xa) bioassay. We found that LMWH, but not UFH, inhibited platelet activation induced by low concentrations (1 \u00d7 106 plaque forming units/mL) of both EHV-1 strains at 40 h. At this time point, all horses had anti-Xa activities above 0.1 U/ml (range 0.15-0.48 U/ml) with LMWH, but not UFH. By 60 h, a platelet inhibitory effect was no longer detected and anti-Xa activity had decreased (range 0.03 to 0.07 U/ml) in LMWH-treated horses. Neither heparin inhibited platelet activation induced by high concentrations (5 \u00d7 106 plaque forming units/mL) of the RacL11 strain. We found substantial between horse variability in EHV-1-induced platelet activation at baseline and after treatment. Minor injection site reactions developed in horses given either heparin. These results suggest that LMWH therapy may prevent thrombotic sequelae of EHV-1, however further evaluation of dosage regimens is required.", "PURPOSE The AngioVac catheter system is a mechanical suction device designed for removal of intravascular material using extracorporeal veno-venous bypass circuit. The purpose of this study is to present the outcomes in patients treated with the AngioVac aspiration system and to discuss its efficacy in different vascular beds. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospectively review was performed of seven patients treated with AngioVac between October 2013 and December 2014. In 6/7 cases, the AngioVac cannula was inserted percutaneously and the patient was placed on veno-venous bypass. In one of the cases, the cannula was inserted directly into the Fontan circuit after sternotomy and the patient was maintained on cardiopulmonary bypass. Thrombus location included iliocaval (2), SVC (1), pulmonary arteries (1), Fontan circuit and Glenn shunt with pulmonary artery extension (1), right atrium (1), and IVC with renal vein extension (1). RESULTS The majority of thrombus (50-95%) was removed in 5/7 cases, and partial thrombus removal (<50%) was confirmed in 2/7 cases. Mean follow-up was 205 days (range 64-403 days). All patients were alive at latest follow-up. Minor complications included three neck hematomas in two total patients. No major complications occurred. CONCLUSION AngioVac is a useful tool for acute thrombus removal in the large vessels. The setup and substantial cost may limit its application in straightforward cases. More studies are needed to establish the utility of AngioVac in treatment of intravascular and intracardiac material.", "Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a new local therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, we investigated the risk factors associated with local recurrence of HCC after single-session RFA with a single electrode insertion. From April 2003 to December 2007, we treated 138 HCC lesions by single-session RFA with a single electrode insertion using the Cool-tip RFA, RTC 2000 and RTC 3000 Systems. Risk factors for the local recurrence of these lesions and complications after RFA were analyzed. The mean size of the 138 lesions was 16.9\u00b15.4 mm in diameter (range 7-33 mm). Local recurrence rates were 6.6 and 22.0% at 1 and 2 years, respectively, during the mean follow-up period of 16.4 months. Univariate analysis showed that tumor diameter (\u226520 mm), tumor location, pre-treatment AFP-L3 fraction level and ablation pattern were significant variables. Multivariate analysis of these four variables identified only the tumor diameter as an independent risk factor for local recurrence. Complications occurred in 2.2% of the lesions (3/138). Single-session RFA is an effective treatment for HCC in that it reduces serious complications. This study demonstrated that a tumor size \u226520 mm influenced the local recurrence of single-session RFA with a single electrode insertion.", "/OBJECTIVE Laparoscopic distal splenopancreatectomy (DSP) is an effective and safe surgical modality for treating benign and borderline distal pancreatic tumors, but rarely for pancreatic cancer. This study aimed to examine the feasibility, effectiveness, and safety of laparoscopic versus laparotomic DSP in pancreatic body-tail cancer (PBTC) patients. METHODS Thirty-four PBTC patients were consecutively and retrospectively hospitalized for elective laparoscopic DSP (n = 11) or laparotomy (n = 23) between January 2007 and December 2011. The primary outcome measure was mean overall survival (OS). RESULTS All patients underwent DSP via laparoscopy or laparotomy as scheduled and were followed-up for 12-72 months. The two groups showed statistically similar mean operative time (laparoscopy vs. laparotomy, 150 \u00b1 54 vs. 160 \u00b1 48 min), median volume of intraoperative bleeding (100 [50-400] vs. 150 [50-350] ml), and rate of postoperative pancreatic fistula (18.2 vs. 21.7 %). The laparoscopy group had a significantly shorter median duration of hospitalization (5 [3-12] vs. 8 [7-22] d, P < 0.05). All patients had a clear resection margin and showed statistically similar tumor size (2.8 \u00b1 1.5 vs. 3.1 \u00b1 1.7 cm), number of lymph nodes dissected (14.8 \u00b1 4.5 vs. 16.1 \u00b1 5.7), and mean OS (42.0 \u00b1 8.6 vs. 54.0 \u00b1 5.8 mo, P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic DSP is a feasible, effective, and safe alternative to laparotomy in carefully selected PBTC patients and is associated with a more rapid postoperative recovery.", " Incisional ventral hernia is one of the most common surgical complications after laparotomy. Laparoscopic repair of incisional ventral hernia has been conducted recently, and the advantages of this procedure have been reported. However, in large orifice cases, the recurrence rate is increased. To improve recurrence rates in large cases, a hybrid method combining laparoscopic primary closure and mesh repair can be applied. MATERIALS AND SURGICAL TECHNIQUE Monofilament thread was inserted into the abdominal cavity for hernia closure and pulled from the other side of the orifice. The same procedure was performed from the upper side to the lower side without closure, and all thread was placed in line. Both sides of the thread were then introduced to the midline of the incision through a subcutaneous route. This procedure was conducted with an introducer. All threads were tied, and then a mesh was placed. DISCUSSION Hybrid techniques already combine mini-laparotomy for hernia closure and subsequent laparoscopic intraoperative onlay mesh for reinforcement, but such techniques require laparotomy. In our technique, closure of the linea alba does not require laparotomy. All procedures were performed laparoscopically. This procedure is very easy and safe, and does not require the abdominal cavity to be opened. Thus, hybrid methods are effective for treating cases of incisional hernia involving a large orifice.", "We have just read with interest the article recently published in your Journal and titled \"Anticoagulant treatment is associated with decreased mortality in severe coronavirus disease 2019 patients with coagulopathy\" by Tang N. et al (1). In this article, it is suggested that those patients with COVID-19 that accomplish the Sepsis-Induced Coagulopathy (SIC) criteria, and receive anticoagulant treatment would present a reduction of mortality rates. It is well known that both shock and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) are the two major causes of organ dysfunction in sepsis (2). Furthermore, DIC is a strong predictor of mortality in patients with sepsis, independently of the severity of sepsis (2).", "Surgery remains the curative treatment modality for colorectal cancer in all stages, including stage IV with resectable liver metastasis. There is emerging evidence that the stress response caused by surgery as well as other perioperative therapies such as anesthesia and analgesia may promote growth of pre-existing micro-metastasis or potentially initiate tumor dissemination. Therapeutically targeting the perioperative period may therefore reduce the effect that surgical treatments have in promoting metastases, for example by combining \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonists and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors in the perioperative setting. In this paper, we highlight some of the mechanisms that may underlie surgery-related metastatic development in colorectal cancer. These include direct tumor spillage at the time of surgery, suppression of the anti-tumor immune response, direct stimulatory effects on tumor cells, and activation of the coagulation system. We summarize in more detail results that support a role for catecholamines as major drivers of the pro-metastatic effect induced by the surgical stress response, predominantly through activation of \u03b2-adrenergic signaling. Additionally, we argue that an improved understanding of surgical stress-induced dissemination, and more specifically whether it impacts on the level and nature of heterogeneity within residual tumor cells, would contribute to the successful clinical targeting of this process. Finally, we provide a proof-of-concept demonstration that ex-vivo analyses of colorectal cancer patient-derived samples using RGB-labeling technology can provide important insights into the heterogeneous sensitivity of tumor cells to stress signals. This suggests that intra-tumor heterogeneity is likely to influence the efficacy of perioperative \u03b2-adrenergic receptor and COX-2 inhibition, and that ex-vivo characterization of heterogeneous stress response in tumor samples can synergize with other models to optimize perioperative treatments and further improve outcome in colorectal and other solid cancers.", " AND AIMS Total laparoscopic surgery is not a new concept, but it is not preferred generally for right colectomy. The aim of the study is to evaluate the outcomes, which are related with surgical technique after total laparoscopic right colectomy (TLRC) and laparoscopic-assisted right colectomy (LARC) for right colon cancer in 30 consecutive patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS Thirty patients with right colon cancer, half of which were treated with TLRC and half of which were treated with LARC, were compared with regard to patient demographics, operative and postoperative data, histopathologic findings, follow-up data, and the complications related to the surgical technique. RESULTS There were 16 men and 14 women, median age was 63 years (range 41-86) with a body mass index (BMI) of 27 kg/m2 (range 20-33). There were no differences between the groups for BMI, harvested lymph node number, or distal and radial margins. The length of the incision and the length of the postoperative stay was shorter in the TLRC group (p=0.000). Overall complications were higher in the LARC group than in the TLRC group (p=0.014). The median follow-up was 28 months (range 5-99). In the late period, two patients in the LARC group were reoperated on. The cause of reoperation was internal herniation in one patient due to ileal twisting and incisional hernia in the other one. CONCLUSION Our preliminary data indicate that TLRC could result in better outcomes for right colon cancer patients than LARC.", " The technique of balloon remodeling allows the endovascular treatment of wide-neck intracranial aneurysms. For many years the only available devices were the Hyperform and the Hyperglide balloon catheters. Recently, other companies have developed newer devices, single or dual-lumen. We present our initial experience with the TransForm occlusion balloon catheter for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms. METHODS We retrospectively analysed from our prospectively gathered aneurysm database all aneurysms that were treated with balloon remodelling using TransForm occlusion balloon catheters from January 2013 to February 2014. We assessed patient demographics, morphological features of the aneurysms, procedure feasibility, technical and clinical complications. RESULTS Thirty-three patients harbouring 36 intracranial saccular aneurysms were treated during 33 procedures. Clinical finding were: 15 incidental discovery, 13 subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH), five aneurysms with mass effect, one ruptured aneurysm with SAH and mass effect, one recanalisation and one intraparenchymal haematoma. Thirty-five aneurysms were in the anterior and one in the posterior circulation. Mean dome and neck size were, respectively, 5.8 mm and 3.6 mm. Twenty-three aneurysms were treated with TransForm C and 13 with TransForm SC. We had two procedural thromboembolic complications, without permanent clinical events. No early rebleeding occurred. CONCLUSIONS In our small series, the TransForm occlusion balloon catheter seems to be safe and effective for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms, in ruptured and unruptured cases.", "Compression therapy--including inelastic, elastic, and intermittent pneumatic compression--is the standard of care for venous ulcers (VLUs) and chronic venous insufficiency, but there is no consensus in the literature regarding the most effective type of compression therapy. A prospective, randomized, clinical pilot study was conducted among 70 patients with unilateral VLUs treated in a hospital dermatology department in Poland to compare three types of compression therapy (intermittent pneumatic compression, stockings, and short-stretch bandages) in persons with superficial deep venous reflux alone or combined with the segmental variety. Study endpoints were change in ulcer dimensions and proportions healed. Patients with superficial or combined superficial and deep vein insufficiency were randomly allocated to receive one of the three therapies (one of each vein type for each treatment option, six groups total). All patients received saline-soaked gauze dressings along with micronized purified flavonoid fraction, diosmin, hesperidin, and Daflon 500 once daily. Compression treatments were changed or pneumatic compression provided daily for 15 days. Wound size reduction and percentage of wounds healed were significantly higher in groups receiving intermittent pneumatic compression or stockings than in groups using short-stretch bandages (for percentage change of ulcer surface area, P = 0.02; for healing rates P = 0.01). These results warrant additional randomized controlled clinical studies with a larger sample size and longer patient follow-up.", "OBJECTIVE To conduct a systematic review of evidence supporting the efficacy and safety profiles of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) introduced in the last decade for the treatment of patients with osteoarthritis (OA), including their analgesic effects, ability to improve function, and adverse event profiles relative to current standards of care. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Systematic search of the literature for NSAIDs approved by the FDA (2000-2010). RESULTS One new orally-administered NSAID molecule (meloxicam), two orally-administered NSAID formulations (naproxen plus lansoprazole; oxycodone/ibuprofen), and three topical NSAID formulations (diclofenac patch, gel, and solution) were approved by the FDA (2000-2010). A systematic literature review found evidence to support efficacy in treating patients with OA for all agents except oxycodone/ibuprofen, which has not been studied in this patient population, although ibuprofen and immediate-release oxycodone have been studied individually for OA pain. Evidence quality was inconsistent, with several agents lacking long-term, controlled trials against active comparators, and functional end points inconsistently met. Although low-dose meloxicam and naproxen plus lansoprazole offer a reduced risk of adverse gastrointestinal (GI) events, cardiovascular and renal risks remain similar to traditional oral NSAID therapy. Further, only lower doses of meloxicam appear to carry a reduced risk of GI events. Diclofenac patch, gel, and solution preparations offer the potential for reduced GI, cardiovascular, and renal adverse events. The level of evidence available to support the efficacy and safety of these agents for long-term treatment of patients with OA differs, with some having only short-term trials, while others have longer-duration trials with active comparators. CONCLUSIONS By expanding the treatment armamentarium, newly-approved NSAID agents may improve the ability of clinicians to tailor analgesic therapy for their diverse patient populations and to achieve realistic functional improvements. The comparisons in this article were limited to drugs that received approval after 2000 and should be considered accordingly.", "OBJECTIVE Treatment of intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas (dAVFs) remains a challenge. However, after introduction of Onyx, transarterial approach is the preferred treatment option in many centers. We report our experience of dAVFs embolization with special emphasis on transarterial approach. METHODS Seventeen embolization procedures were performed in 13 patients with dAVFs between Jan 2009 and Oct 2014. Clinical symptoms, location and type of fistulas, embolization methods, complications, radiological and clinical outcomes were evaluated using charts and PACS images. RESULTS All 13 patients had symptomatic lesions. The locations of fistulas were transverse-sigmoid sinus in 6, middle fossa dura in 4, cavernous sinus in 2, and superior sagittal sinus in 1 patient. Cognard types were as follows : I in 4, IIa in 2, IIa+IIb in 5, and IV in 2. Embolization procedures were performed \u22652 times in 3 patients. Nine patients were treated with transarterial Onyx embolization alone. One of these required direct surgical puncture of middle meningeal artery. Complete obliteration of fistulas was achieved in 11/13 (85%) patients. There were no complications except for 1 case of Onyx migration in cavernous dAVF. Modified Rankin scale score at post-operative 3 months were 0 in 11, and 3 in 2 patients. CONCLUSION Transarterial Onyx embolization can be a first line therapeutic option in patients with dAVFs. However, transvenous approach should be tried first in cavernous sinus dAVF because of the risk of intracranial migration of liquid embolic materials. Furthermore, combined surgical endovascular approach can be considered as a useful option in inaccessible route.", "Dl-3-N-butylphthalide (NBP) is approved in China for the treatment of ischemic stroke. Previous studies have shown that NBP promotes recovery after stroke via multiple mechanisms. However, the effect of NBP on vascular function and thrombosis remains unclear. Here, we aim to study the effect of NBP on vascular function using a rat model of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and a state-of-the-art high-resolution synchrotron radiation angiography. Eighty SD rats underwent MCAO surgery. NBP (90 mg/kg) was administrated daily by gavage. Synchrotron radiation angiography was used to evaluate the cerebral vascular perfusion, vasoconstriction, and vasodilation in real-time. Neurological scores, brain infarction and atrophy were evaluated. Real-time PCR was used to assess the expression levels of thrombosis and vasoconstriction-related genes. Results revealed that NBP attenuated thrombosis after MCAO and reduced brain infarct and atrophy volume. NBP administrated at 1 and 4 h after MCAO prevented the vasoconstriction of the artery and maintained its diameter at normal level. Administrated at one week after surgery, NBP functioned as a vasodilator in rats after MCAO while displayed no vasodilating effect in sham group. Our results suggested that NBP attenuates brain injury via increasing the regional blood flow by reducing thrombosis and vasoconstriction.", "Background and objectives: The use of antagonistic probiotic microorganisms and their byproducts represents a promising approach for the treatment of viral diseases. In the current work, the effect of exopolysaccharides (EPSs) produced by lactic acid bacteria from different genera on the structural and functional characteristics of cells and the development of adenoviral infection in vitro was studied. Materials and Methods: Cytotoxicity of six EPSs of lactic acid bacteria of the genera Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc and Pediococcus was determined by MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay. The influence of the EPSs on the infectivity of human adenovirus type 5 (HAdV-5) and on the cell cycle under a condition of adenovirus infection was studied using plaque reduction assay and flow cytometric analysis, respectively. Results: It was shown that exopolysaccharides were non-toxic to Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells (MDBK) as they reduced their viability by 3\u201317%. A change in the distribution of the cell cycle phases in the non-infected cell population treated with EPSs was observed. The analysis demonstrated an increase in the number of cells in the S phase by 47% when using EPSs 15a and a decrease in the number of cells in the G1 phase by 20\u201327% when treated with the EPSs 15a, 33a, and 19s. The use of EPSs did not led to the normalization of the life cycle of HAdV-5 infected cells to the level of non-infected cells. The EPSs showed low virucidal activity and reduced the HAdV-5 infectivity to 85%. Among the studied exopolysaccharides, anti-adenovirus activity was found for EPS 26a that is produced by Lactobacillus spp. strain. The treatment of cells with the EPS following virus adsorption completely (100%) suppressed the formation and release of HAdV-5 infectious. Conclusions: EPS 26a possessed distinct anti-HAdV-5 activity and the obtained data demonstrate the potential of using exopolysaccharides as anti-adenoviral agents.", " Endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms can be technically difficult when the neck is wide. The Solitaire AB stent (Covidien, Irvine, California), the only fully retrieved stent, assists in the coiling of wide-neck intracranial aneurysms. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the mid-term angiographic follow-up of wide-necked aneurysms treated with the Solitaire AB stent. METHODS SOLARE (SOLitaire Aneurysm Remodeling) is a consecutive, prospective study conducted in 7 European centers. A core laboratory evaluated the postoperative and mid-term (6 month \u00b1 15 days) angiographic results by using the Raymond classification Scale. Recanalization was defined as worsening, and progressive thrombosis was defined as improvement in the Raymond scale score. RESULTS The mean width of the aneurysm sac was 7.5 mm, and the mean diameter of the aneurysm neck was 4.7 mm. Angiographic mid-term follow-up was obtained in 55 of 65 aneurysms (85.9%). Complete occlusion was achieved in 33 aneurysms (60%); a neck remnant was seen in 16 aneurysms (29.1%) and an aneurysm remnant in 6 aneurysms (10.9%). Of 55 aneurysms, recanalization was observed in 8 aneurysms (14.5%), and progressive thrombosis was observed in 17 aneurysms (30.9%). No bleeding or rebleeding was observed during the follow-up period. CONCLUSION Stent-assisted coiling of wide-necked intracranial aneurysms was found to be safe and effective with the Solitaire AB stent at 6-month follow-up. Angiographic results improve with time due to progressive thrombosis of the aneurysm.", " We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of thrombectomy for the treatment of stroke in a trial embedded within a population-based stroke reperfusion registry. METHODS During a 2-year period at four centers in Catalonia, Spain, we randomly assigned 206 patients who could be treated within 8 hours after the onset of symptoms of acute ischemic stroke to receive either medical therapy (including intravenous alteplase when eligible) and endovascular therapy with the Solitaire stent retriever (thrombectomy group) or medical therapy alone (control group). All patients had confirmed proximal anterior circulation occlusion and the absence of a large infarct on neuroimaging. In all study patients, the use of alteplase either did not achieve revascularization or was contraindicated. The primary outcome was the severity of global disability at 90 days, as measured on the modified Rankin scale (ranging from 0 [no symptoms] to 6 [death]). Although the maximum planned sample size was 690, enrollment was halted early because of loss of equipoise after positive results for thrombectomy were reported from other similar trials. RESULTS Thrombectomy reduced the severity of disability over the range of the modified Rankin scale (adjusted odds ratio for improvement of 1 point, 1.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05 to 2.8) and led to higher rates of functional independence (a score of 0 to 2) at 90 days (43.7% vs. 28.2%; adjusted odds ratio, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.1 to 4.0). At 90 days, the rates of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage were 1.9% in both the thrombectomy group and the control group (P=1.00), and rates of death were 18.4% and 15.5%, respectively (P=0.60). Registry data indicated that only eight patients who met the eligibility criteria were treated outside the trial at participating hospitals. CONCLUSIONS Among patients with anterior circulation stroke who could be treated within 8 hours after symptom onset, stent retriever thrombectomy reduced the severity of post-stroke disability and increased the rate of functional independence. (Funded by Fundaci\u00f3 Ictus Malaltia Vascular through an unrestricted grant from Covidien and others; REVASCAT ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01692379.).", " Optimal obesity therapy is a matter of debate. Besides weight reduction, other criteria such as safety and nutritional status are of relevance. Therefore, we compared a favored surgical intervention with the most effective conservative treatment regarding anthropometry and nutritional status. METHODS Fifty-four obese patients were included who underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG, n = 27) or a 52-week multidisciplinary intervention program (MIP, n = 27) for weight loss. Body weight, body composition assessed by bioelectrical impedance analysis, and serum protein levels were measured before and within 12 months after intervention. RESULTS After 1 year of observation, excess weight loss was more pronounced following LSG (65 %) compared to MIP (38 %, p < 0.001). In both groups, body fat was clearly reduced, but a higher reduction occurred in the LSG group. However, protein status deteriorated particularly in the LSG group. Within 1 year, body cell mass declined from 37.1 to 26.9 kg in the LSG group, but only from 35.7 to 32.2 kg in the MIP group. This resulted in an increased mean extracellular mass/body cell mass ratio (1.42 versus 1.00, p < 0.001), in a decreased mean phase angle (4.4\u00b0 versus 6.6\u00b0, p < 0.001), and in a lower prealbumin level in serum (p < 0.02) in the LSG group compared to the MIP group. CONCLUSIONS LSG, compared to MIP, was more effective regarding excess weight loss and body fat loss within 1 year, however, induced more pronounced muscle mass and protein loss, possibly requiring particular interventions such as exercise or protein supplements.", "OBJECTIVE Internal carotid artery (ICA) injury is a rare but severe complication of endonasal surgery. The authors describe their endovascular experience managing ICA injuries after transsphenoidal surgery; they review and summarize the current literature regarding endovascular techniques; and they propose a treatment algorithm based on the available evidence. METHODS A retrospective review of 576 transsphenoidal pituitary adenoma resections was performed. Cases of ICA injury occurring at our institution and transfers from other hospitals were evaluated. Endovascular treatments for ICA injury reported in the literature were also reviewed and summarized. RESULTS Seven cases were identified from the institutional cohort (mean age 46.3 years, mean follow-up 43.4 months [1-107 months]) that received endovascular treatment for ICA injury. Five injuries occurred at our institution (5 [0.9%] of 576), and 2 injuries occurred at outside hospitals. Three patients underwent ICA sacrifice by coil placement, 2 underwent lesion embolization (coil or stent-assisted coil placement), and 2 underwent endoluminal reconstruction (both with flow diversion devices). Review of the literature identified 98 cases of ICA injury treated with endovascular methods. Of the 105 total cases, 46 patients underwent ICA sacrifice, 28 underwent lesion embolization, and 31 underwent endoluminal reconstruction. Sacrifice of the ICA proved a durable solution in all cases; however, the rate of persistent neurological complications was relatively high (10 [21.7%] of 46). Lesion embolization was primarily performed by coil embolization without stenting (16 cases) and stent-assisted coiling (9 cases). Both techniques had a relatively high rate of at least some technical complication (6 [37.5%] of 16 and 5 [55.6%] of 9, respectively) and major technical complications (i.e., injury, new neurological deficit, or ICA sacrifice) (5 [31.3%] of 16 and 2 [22.2%] of 9, respectively). Endoluminal reconstruction was performed by covered stent (24 cases) and flow diverter (5 cases) placement. Covered stents showed a reasonably high rate of technical complications (10 [41.7%] of 24); however, 8 of these problems were resolved, leaving a small percentage with major technical complications (2 [8.3%] of 24). Flow diverter placement was also well tolerated, with only 1 minor technical complication. CONCLUSIONS Endovascular treatments including vessel sacrifice, coil embolization (with or without stent assistance), and endoluminal reconstruction offer a tailored approach to ICA injury management after endonasal surgery. Vessel sacrifice remains the definitive treatment for acute, uncontrolled bleeding; however, vessel preservation techniques should be considered carefully in select patients. Multiple factors including vascular anatomy, injury characteristics, and risk of dual antiplatelet therapy should guide best treatment, but more study is needed (particularly with flow diverters) to refine this decision-making process. Ideally, all endovascular treatment options should be available at institutions performing endonasal surgery.", " Minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) is accepted for resection of early esophageal cancers. The optimal surgical approach for more advanced disease is unknown. An evaluation of MIE in patients with advanced tumors having undergone neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) is presented. METHODS A retrospective review of patients with esophageal cancer who underwent MIE from November 2006 to November 2011 was performed RESULTS In total, 96 consecutive patients underwent MIE for malignancy. Median age was 65 years (range 26 to 88), and 86% were male. Adenocarcinoma represented 87% of patients. Eighty-three percent of patients were staged IIa or higher and 62 (65%) patients received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Four (6%) patients additionally received intraoperative electron beam radiotherapy. Twenty-six (27%) patients received postoperative adjuvant therapy with 22 (85%) of these having also received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. All cases were completed thoraco-laparoscopically except for 2 conversions to mini-laparotomy. Twelve (12%) cervical anastomoses and 84 (88%) thoracic anastomoses were performed. Median operative time was 326 minutes (range 193 to 567) and did not differ significantly between those with and without nCRT. Complete pathologic response was seen in 21 (34%) of the 62 patients receiving neoadjuvant treatment. Major and minor morbidities were experienced in 28% and 38.5% of patients. There were 2 (2%) in-hospital mortalities; 1 each having received or not received neoadjuvant therapy. At median follow-up 24 months (range 3 to 70 months), overall survival was 58% and 55 (57%) patients were alive without recurrence. CONCLUSIONS Minimally invasive esophagectomy is an acceptable surgical therapy for advanced-stage esophageal malignancies after nCRT without evidence for increased morbidity or mortality.", "PURPOSE To retrospectively evaluate technical success, effectiveness, complications, patient survival, and prognostic factors with percutaneous radiofrequency (RF) ablation for pulmonary metastases resulting from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). MATERIALS AND METHODS Thirty-two patients from six institutions were included, with a total of 83 pulmonary metastases treated in 65 sessions. RF ablation was always performed percutaneously with computed tomography (CT) guidance. Primary endpoints were technical success and technique effectiveness. Technique effectiveness was evaluated based on sequential follow-up CT images. Secondary study endpoints were complications, patient survival, and determination of prognostic factors. Complications were classified as major or minor. Prognostic factors were determined by analyzing multiple variables with the log-rank test. RESULTS Technical success rate was 100%. Primary technique effectiveness rates were 92% each at 1, 2, and 3 years. Major and minor complications occurred after 16 (25%) and 23 (35%) of the 65 sessions, respectively. The median follow-up period was 20.5 months. Overall survival rates were 87% at 1 year and 57% each at 2 and 3 years (median and mean survival times, 37.7 mo and 43.2 mo, respectively). Significantly better survival rates were obtained in cases of (i) no viable intrahepatic recurrence (P < .001), (ii) Child-Pugh class A disease (P < .001), (iii) absence of liver cirrhosis (P < .001), (iv) absence of hepatitis C virus infection (P = .006), and (v) \u03b1-fetoprotein level of 10 ng/mL or lower (P = .007) at the time of RF ablation. CONCLUSIONS RF ablation appears effective, with an acceptable safety profile, in selected patients with pulmonary metastases resulting from HCC.", " AND PURPOSE We sought to determine hospital and patient characteristics associated with the use of endovascular therapy for acute ischemic stroke and to analyze trends in clinical outcome. METHODS Data were from Get With The Guidelines-Stroke hospitals from April 1, 2003, to June 30, 2013. We looked at trends in number of hospitals providing endovascular therapy, the use of endovascular therapy in these hospitals and clinical outcomes. We analyzed hospital and patient characteristics associated with endovascular therapy use. RESULTS Of 1087 hospitals, 454 provided endovascular therapy to \u22651 patient in the study period. From 2003 to 2012, proportion of hospitals providing endovascular therapy increased by 1.6% per year (from 12.9% to 28.9%; P<0.0001), with a modest drop to 23.4% in 2013. Utilization of endovascular therapy increased from 0.7% to 2% (P<0.001) with a modest drop to 1.9% in 2013. The overall rate of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage among endovascular therapy treated patients was 9.7%. In multivariable analyses, patient outcomes after endovascular therapy improved over time, with reductions in in-hospital mortality (29.6% in 2004 to 16.2% in 2013; P=0.002); and from late 2010, reduction in symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (11% in 2010 to 5% in 2013; P<0.0001), increased independent ambulation at discharge (24.5% in 2010 to 33% in 2013; P<0.0001) and discharge home (17.7% in 2010 to 26.1% in 2013; P<0.0001). Trends for these outcomes persist in the analyses adjusted for baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale. CONCLUSION The use of endovascular therapy increased modestly nationally from 2003 to 2012 and decreased in 2013. Clinical outcomes improved notably from 2010 to 2013, coincident with more experience and newer thrombectomy devices.", "OBJECTIVES The vast majority of ICU patients require some form of venous access. There are no evidenced-based guidelines concerning the use of either central or peripheral venous catheters, despite very different complications. It remains unknown which to insert in ICU patients. We investigated the rate of catheter-related insertion or maintenance complications in two strategies: one favoring the central venous catheters and the other peripheral venous catheters. DESIGN Multicenter, controlled, parallel-group, open-label randomized trial. SETTING Three French ICUs. PATIENTS Adult ICU patients with equal central or peripheral venous access requirement. INTERVENTION Patients were randomized to receive central venous catheters or peripheral venous catheters as initial venous access. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS The primary endpoint was the rate of major catheter-related complications within 28 days. Secondary endpoints were the rate of minor catheter-related complications and a composite score-assessing staff utilization and time spent to manage catheter insertions. Analysis was intention to treat. We randomly assigned 135 patients to receive a central venous catheter and 128 patients to receive a peripheral venous catheter. Major catheter-related complications were greater in the peripheral venous catheter than in the central venous catheter group (133 vs 87, respectively, p=0.02) although none of those was life threatening. Minor catheter-related complications were 201 with central venous catheters and 248 with peripheral venous catheters (p=0.06). 46% (60/128) patients were managed throughout their ICU stay with peripheral venous catheters only. There were significantly more peripheral venous catheter-related complications per patient in patients managed solely with peripheral venous catheter than in patients that received peripheral venous catheter and at least one central venous catheter: 1.92 (121/63) versus 1.13 (226/200), p<0.005. There was no difference in central venous catheter-related complications per patient between patients initially randomized to peripheral venous catheters but subsequently crossed-over to central venous catheter and patients randomized to the central venous catheter group. Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival probability did not differ between the two groups. CONCLUSION In ICU patients with equal central or peripheral venous access requirement, central venous catheters should preferably be inserted: a strategy associated with less major complications.", "PURPOSE The objective of this review was to evaluate the safety and efficiency of single-incision laparoscopic liver surgery (SILLS) for malignant liver lesions. METHODS A retrospective review of the Medline database was performed, including studies published up to February 2019. RESULTS Overall, 69 patients (50 males) with a median age of 61 years (range, 31-90) from 16 studies underwent SILLS for malignant liver disease and were included in this review. The majority of patients underwent resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 52, 75 %), followed by metastatic disease (n = 15, 22 %). The hepatic lesions were located in anterolateral liver segments in 62 patients (90 %) and in posterosuperior liver segments in 7 patients (10 %). Sixty-five patients (94 %) underwent minor liver resection. The median blood loss was 200 mL (range 0-2500), while 4 patients that underwent single-port resection were converted to either conventional laparoscopy or open resections. Two cases were reported to be associated with postoperative complications in the single-port group (1 [1.7 %] grade Dindo-Clavien I-II, 1 [1.7 %] grade Dindo-Clavien III-IV), while no complications were noted in the multiport group. All patients successfully underwent R0 resection. CONCLUSIONS SILLS seems to be a safe and efficient treatment modality for malignant liver disease when performed by experienced surgeons in carefully selected patients. More studies are needed to better identify which patients may benefit from such an operative approach.", " Fecal incontinence is a distressing condition that is difficult to treat. Injection of bulking agents has been used to treat passive fecal incontinence. However, no long-term results are available. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to assess the long-term clinical effectiveness of intra-anal injection of collagen for passive fecal incontinence. DESIGN This research is a retrospective cohort study from a prospectively collected database SETTING This investigation took place in a high-volume tertiary colorectal department. PATIENTS All patients who underwent intra-anal injection of collagen for passive fecal incontinence with internal sphincter dysfunction between January 2006 and December 2009 were included in the study. Data including demographic details, preoperative anorectal physiology, and outcome measures were collected prospectively and maintained in a database MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcomes measured were the Cleveland Clinic Florida incontinence score and the responses to a subjective patient satisfaction questionnaire before the procedure and at subsequent follow-up visits. Data were analyzed by using SPSS v19.0. RESULTS One hundred patients (70 female; mean age, 61 years (range, 36-82)) were followed up for a minimum duration of 36 months. Fifty-six patients (56%) had an improvement in fecal incontinence score from a mean of 14 (range, 9-18) to a mean of 8 (range, 5-14). A total of 68% reported subjective improvement in symptoms. Thirty-eight patients (38%) required a repeat injection of collagen, and a further 15 patients required a third injection. The median interval between the first and final injection was 12 months (range, 4-16 months). Age was the only independent predictor of successful outcome (p = 0.032). There was no morbidity. LIMITATIONS This study was limited by its nonrandomized retrospective design. CONCLUSIONS Injection of collagen into the internal anal sphincter is simple, safe, and effective in patients with passive fecal incontinence, although repeat injections are necessary in approximately half of the patients.", "Multimodality cancer therapy involving surgical resection, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy is frequently employed in the management of head and neck cancer. Patients who have undergone such therapy face substantial challenges during and after treatment. Prosthodontic rehabilitation is essential during and after tumor ablation to restore function, esthetics, and minimize interruption in daily routine. This clinical report describes the challenges faced by a patient undergoing multimodality therapy for a squamous cell carcinoma of the maxillary sinus and the stages involved in prosthodontic rehabilitation.", "Objectives Bronchoscopic lung volume reduction using coils (LVRC) is a well-known treatment option for severe emphysema. The purpose of this study was to identify quantitative computed tomography (QCT) and clinical parameters associated with positive treatment outcome. Patients and methods The CT scans, pulmonary function tests (PFT), and 6-minute walk test (6-MWT) data were collected from 72 patients with advanced emphysema prior to and at 3 months after LVRC treatment. The procedure involved placing 10 coils unilaterally. Various QCT parameters were derived using Apollo imaging software (VIDA). Independent predictors of clinically relevant outcome (\u03946-MWT \u2265 26 m, \u0394FEV1 \u2265 12%, \u0394RV \u2265 10%) were identified through stepwise linear regression analysis. Results The response outcome for \u03946-MWT, for \u0394FEV1 and for \u0394RV was met by 55%, 32% and 42%, respectively. For \u03946-MWT \u2265 26 m a lower baseline 6-MWT (p = 0.0003) and a larger standard deviation (SD) of low attenuation cluster (LAC) sizes in peripheral regions of treated lung (p = 0.0037) were significantly associated with positive outcome. For \u0394FEV1 \u2265 12%, lower baseline FEV1 (p = 0.02) and larger median LAC sizes in the central regions of treated lobe (p = 0.0018) were significant predictors of good response. For \u0394RV \u2265 10% a greater baseline TLC (p = 0.0014) and a larger SD of LAC sizes in peripheral regions of treated lung (p = 0.007) tended to respond better. Conclusion Patients with lower FEV1 and 6-MWT, with higher TLC and specific QCT characteristics responded more positively to LVRC treatment, suggesting a more targeted CT-based approach to patient selection could lead to greater efficacy in treatment response.", "OBJECTIVE Most reviews of pharmacological strategies for delirium treatment evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions for delirium prevention, reduction in duration and severity of ongoing delirium, and other outcomes that extend beyond the recommendations of expert treatment guidelines. However, little if any attention is given to substantiating the potential benefits of such treatment or addressing the methodological weaknesses that, in part, limit the pharmacological recommendations made by expert treatment guidelines. Therefore, the authors conducted a systematic review to provide the most up-to-date and inclusive review of published prospective trials of potential pharmacological interventions for the prevention and treatment of delirium, and they discuss potential benefits of pharmacological prevention of delirium and/or reduction of ongoing delirium episode duration and severity. METHOD The analysis followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, including prospective randomized and nonrandomized double-blind, single-blind, and open-label clinical trials of any pharmacological agent for the prevention or treatment of delirium and reviewing them systematically for effectiveness on several predefined outcomes. RESULTS The pharmacological strategies reviewed showed greater success in preventing delirium than in treating it. Significant delirium prevention effects are associated with haloperidol, second-generation antipsychotics, iliac fascia block, gabapentin, melatonin, lower levels of intraoperative propofol sedation, and a single dose of ketamine during anesthetic induction and with dexmedetomidine compared with other sedation strategies for mechanically ventilated patients. CONCLUSIONS These promising results warrant further study with consideration of the methodological weaknesses and inconsistencies of studies to date.", "Advances are being made in understanding the pathogenesis, treatment outcomes and surveillance of Barrett oesophagus. Central obesity and age at onset of gastro-oesophageal reflux are being recognized as risk factors that have implications for screening. The persistent finding of nondysplastic Barrett oesophagus during surveillance is associated with low risk of malignant progression, whereas dysplastic Barrett oesophagus requires continued surveillance.", " Abuse-deterrent formulations attempt to address public health and societal concerns regarding opioid abuse. Oxycodone HCl-niacin tablets combine oxycodone HCl with niacin and functional inactive excipients to create potential barriers to oral, intranasal, and intravenous abuse. This study compared the relative abuse potential of oral immediate-release oxycodone HCl-niacin with that of oral immediate-release oxycodone HCl and placebo in nondependent, recreational opioid users. METHODS Forty-nine participants received oxycodone HCl-niacin 40/240 mg and 80/480 mg, oxycodone 40 mg and 80 mg, and placebo in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled and active-controlled, five-way crossover study. Primary endpoints based on a bipolar 100 mm visual analog scale for drug liking were area under effect curve (AUE0-1h, AUE0-2h, AUE0-3h), peak disliking, and effect at 0.5 hours post-dose (E0.5h). Other endpoints included take drug again assessment, overall drug liking, and pupillometry. RESULTS There were statistically significant differences between oxycodone HCl-niacin and oxycodone HCl doses for all primary endpoints (P < 0.0001, all comparisons), suggesting reduced abuse potential with oxycodone HCl-niacin. Take drug again and overall drug liking showed greater liking of oxycodone alone. Oxycodone HCl-niacin 80/480 mg had consistently lower liking assessments than oxycodone HCl-niacin 40/240 mg, suggesting a dose-response to the aversive effects of niacin. Opioid-related adverse events were similar for equivalent oxycodone doses. The treatment-emergent adverse events most specifically associated with oxycodone HCl-niacin (ie, skin-burning sensation, warmth, and flushing) were consistent with the expected vasocutaneous effects of niacin. No serious adverse events were reported. CONCLUSION Oxycodone HCl-niacin tablets may, in a dose-dependent manner, decrease the potential for oral abuse of oxycodone without unexpected adverse events or clinically signifi-cant differences in safety parameters compared with oxycodone alone. Although statistically powered, the small size of the study sample and the characteristics of its participants may not be generalizable to the population that abuses prescription opioid medications.", " Breast cancer is the leading type of cancer causing death in women worldwide. The incidence of the disease is expected to grow worldwide due to the aging of the population and risk factors related to lifestyle behaviors. Considering the lifestyle of women with breast cancer before or after surgery, pilates exercise may be a complementary intervention additionally to standard treatment. OBJECTIVE To analyze the efficacy of pilates compared to other exercises and to no exercise for women with breast cancer diagnosis. METHOD We searched Medline via Pubmed, Embase via Ovid, Amed via EBSCO, Biosis via Ovid, Lilacs and the Cochrane Library for relevant publications until March 2017. The keywords used were pilates and \"breast cancer,\" and only randomized controlled trials were included. Critical appraisal was done using Risk of Bias Tool and GRADE score for assessing the quality of evidence. RESULTS A total of five studies were included in our review. Our results demonstrate that pilates or home-based exercises are better than no exercise in each individual study. We observed significant improvements in the pilates groups compared to home-based exercises. Additionally, in the individual studies, we observed improvements in range of motion, pain and fatigue. CONCLUSION The evidence shows that pilates or home-based exercise should be encouraged to women with breast cancer.", "Medications to treat major depressive disorder (MDD) are not equally effective across patients. Given that neural response to rewards is altered in MDD and given that reward-related circuitry is modulated by dopamine and serotonin, we examined, for the first time, whether reward-related neural activity moderated response to sertraline, an antidepressant medication that targets these neurotransmitters. A total of 222 unmedicated adults with MDD randomized to receive sertraline (n = 110) or placebo (n = 112) in the Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response in Clinical Care (EMBARC) study completed demographic and clinical assessments, and pretreatment functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing a reward task. We tested whether an index of reward system function in the ventral striatum (VS), a key reward circuitry region, moderated differential response to sertraline versus placebo, assessed with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HSRD) over 8 weeks. We observed a significant moderation effect of the reward index, reflecting the temporal dynamics of VS activity, on week-8 depression levels (Fs \u2265 9.67, ps \u2264 0.002). Specifically, VS responses that were abnormal with respect to predictions from reinforcement learning theory were associated with lower week-8 depression symptoms in the sertraline versus placebo arms. Thus, a more abnormal pattern of pretreatment VS dynamic response to reward expectancy (expected outcome value) and prediction error (difference between expected and actual outcome), likely reflecting serotonergic and dopaminergic deficits, was associated with better response to sertraline than placebo. Pretreatment measures of reward-related VS activity may serve as objective neural markers to advance efforts to personalize interventions by guiding individual-level choice of antidepressant treatment.", "The enormous increase in patients with severe respiratory distress due to the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak requires a systematic approach to optimize ventilated patient at risk flow. A standardised algorithm called \"SAVE\" was developed to distribute patients with COVID-19 respiratory distress syndrome requiring invasive ventilation. This program is established by now in Berlin. An instrumental bottleneck of this approach is the vacant slot assignment in the intensive care unit to guarantee constant patient flow. The transfer of the patients after acute care treatment is needed urgently to facilitate the weaning process. In a next step we developed a triage algorithm to identify patients at SAVE intensive care units with potential to wean and transfer to weaning institutions - we called POST SAVE. This manuscript highlights the algorithms including the use of a standardised digital evaluation tool, the use of trained navigators to facilitate the communication between SAVE intensive care units and weaning institutions and the establishment of a prospective data registry for patient assignment and reevaluation of the weaning potential in the future.", " The corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a global pandemic, there are no specific drugs and vaccines for epidemic control at present. More and more clinical practice shows that traditional Chinese medicine has played an important role in the outbreak. Among them, Qingfei Paidu decoction (QPD) combined with antiviral drugs can enhance the therapeutic efficacy for COVID-19. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive and systematic evidence, which urgently requires us to verify its therapeutic efficacy. Hence, we provide a protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS We will search the studies in MEDLINE/PubMed, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang database, VIP database, the Cochrane Library, Chinese Biomedical Database and Chinese Science Citation Database. Searches are limited to clinical studies published in Chinese and English. Next, the quality of each study is assessed according to the criteria of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Then, the outcome data are recorded and pooled by Review Manager 5.3 and STATA 16.0 software. RESULTS The systematic review and meta-analysis aims to review and pool current clinical outcomes of QPD combined with antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19. CONCLUSION This study will provide a high-quality evidence of QPD for the treatment on COVID-19 patients.

Radical cystectomy is the standard treatment. However, due to surgery and postoperative complications, the quality of life of patients is seriously affected. Therefore, it is increasingly important to find prognostic markers and new therapeutic targets for MIBC. Here, we investigated the expression of PDK1, a key regulator of glucose metabolism, in bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA) and its effect on prognosis. The expression pattern of PDK1 was examined by bioinformatics analysis and immunohistochemistry. A total of 101 cases of BLCA were selected for tissue microarrays (TMAs) that contained both tumour and paired normal tissues. We demonstrated that PDK1 expression was correlated with tumour grade and Ki67expression in our TMA cohort (all p values < 0.05). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that patients with MIBC with high PDK1 expression had a worse prognosis than patients with low PDK1 expression (p = 0.016). Multifactor risk analysis showed that increased PDK1 expression was an independent prognostic factor affecting the overall survival of MIBC patients. GSEA showed that the mTOR pathway, HIF pathway, glycolysis, PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling, etc. were differentially enriched in the PDK1 high expression phenotype. Hence, PDK1 may be a prognostic and therapeutic target for MIBC.", "OBJECTIVE To synthesise evidence from exclusively primary prevention data on the effectiveness of statins for prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD), including stroke, and outcomes stratified by baseline risk and gender. DESIGN Overview of systematic reviews (SRs) using Revised-AMSTAR approach to assess quality. DATA SOURCES Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, Scopus and PROSPERO to June 2017. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES SRs of randomised control trials (RCTs) or individual patient data (IPD) from RCTs, examining the effectiveness of statins versus placebo or no treatment on all-cause mortality, coronary heart disease, CVD (including stroke) and composite endpoints, with stratification by baseline risk and gender. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed methodological quality. A narrative synthesis was conducted. RESULTS Three SRs were included. Quality of included SRs was mixed, and none reported on the risk of bias of included trials.We found trends towards reduced all-cause mortality in all SRs (RR 0.91 [95% CI 0.85 to 0.97]), (RR 0.91 [95% CI 0.83 to 1.01]) and (RR 0.78 [95% CI 0.53 to 1.15]) though it was not statistically significant in two SRs. When stratified by baseline risk, the effect on all-cause mortality was no longer statistically significant except in one medium risk category. One review reported significant reductions (RR 0.85 [95% CI 0.77 to 0.95]) in vascular deaths and non-significant reductions in non-vascular deaths (RR 0.97 [95% CI 0.88 to 1.07]). There were significant reductions in composite outcomes overall, but mixed results were reported in these when stratified by baseline risk. These reviews included studies with participants considered risk equivalent to those with established CVD. CONCLUSIONS There is limited evidence on the effectiveness of statins for primary prevention with mixed findings from studies including participants with widely ranging baseline risks. Decision making for the use of statins should consider individual baseline risk, absolute risk reduction and whether risk reduction justifies potential harms and taking a daily medicine for life. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER CRD42017064761.", " Recent studies have shown that the combination of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) may offer a survival advantage compared to monotherapy. PURPOSE To study the effectiveness of combination therapy with RFA and TACE compared to that of TACE alone in a Scandinavian tertiary liver cancer center. MATERIAL AND METHODS A retrospective study of the patients treated with combination therapy vis-\u00e0-vis TACE alone from June 2007 to November 2012 was performed. Eighteen patients were treated with a combination of RFA and TACE with an interval of 1-4 days between the treatments. For comparison, a group of 18 patients treated with TACE as monotherapy in the same time period was matched with the combination group by demographic data, tumor characteristics, biochemical and clinical parameters, and performance status (PS). RESULTS Each group consisted of 14 patients with cirrhosis and four without. There were no significant differences between the groups regarding age, gender, tumor characteristics, causes of cirrhosis, levels of bilirubin, creatinine, prothrombin time, Child Pugh score, or World Health Organization (WHO) performance status. The median survival of patients in the RFA + TACE combination group was 586 days compared to 296 days in the control group. The difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.26). However, when we stratified the data for cirrhosis and WHO performance status, patients in the combination group had significantly better survival (P = 0.024). CONCLUSION Combination therapy with RFA and TACE for unresectable HCC, compared to TACE alone, may offer a survival benefit for a selected group of patients with HCC.", "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused more than 200,000 reported COVID-19 cases in Spain resulting in more than 20,800 deaths as of April 21, 2020. Faecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from COVID-19 patients has extensively been reported. Therefore, we investigated the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in six wastewater treatments plants (WWTPs) serving the major municipalities within the Region of Murcia (Spain), the area with the lowest COVID-19 prevalence within Iberian Peninsula. Firstly, an aluminum hydroxide adsorption-precipitation concentration method was validated using a porcine coronavirus (Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus, PEDV) and mengovirus (MgV). The procedure resulted in average recoveries of 10 \u00b1 3.5% and 10 \u00b1 2.1% in influent water (n = 2) and 3.3 \u00b1 1.6% and 6.2 \u00b1 1.0% in effluent water (n = 2) samples for PEDV and MgV, respectively. Then, the method was used to monitor the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 from March 12 to April 14, 2020 in influent, secondary and tertiary effluent water samples. By using the real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) Diagnostic Panel validated by US CDC that targets three regions of the virus nucleocapsid (N) gene, we estimated quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA titers in untreated wastewater samples of 5.4 \u00b1 0.2 log10 genomic copies/L on average. Two secondary water samples resulted positive (2 out of 18) and all tertiary water samples tested as negative (0 out 12). This environmental surveillance data were compared to declared COVID-19 cases at municipality level, revealing that members of the community were shedding SARS-CoV-2 RNA in their stool even before the first cases were reported by local or national authorities in many of the cities where wastewaters have been sampled. The detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater in early stages of the spread of COVID-19 highlights the relevance of this strategy as an early indicator of the infection within a specific population. At this point, this environmental surveillance could be implemented by municipalities right away as a tool, designed to help authorities to coordinate the exit strategy to gradually lift its coronavirus lockdown.", "Background: Cardiac injury and myocarditis have been described in adults with COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infection in children is typically minimally symptomatic. We report a series of febrile pediatric patients with acute heart failure potentially associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) as defined by the US Centers for Disease Control. Methods: Over a two-month period contemporary with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in France and Switzerland, we retrospectively collected clinical, biological, therapeutic, and early outcomes data in children who were admitted to pediatric intensive care units in 14 centers for cardiogenic shock, left ventricular dysfunction and severe inflammatory state. Results: Thirty-five children were identified and included in the study. Median age at admission was 10 years (range 2-16 years). Co-morbidities were present in 28% including asthma and overweight. Gastrointestinal symptoms were prominent. Left ventricular ejection fraction was <30% in one third; 80% required inotropic support with 28% treated with ECMO. Inflammation markers were suggestive of cytokine storm (interleukin 6 median 135 pg/mL) and macrophage activation (D-dimer median 5284 ng/mL). Mean brain natriuretic peptide was elevated (5743 pg/mL). Thirty-one/35 (88%) patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by PCR of nasopharyngeal swab or serology. All patients received intravenous immune globulin, with adjunctive steroid therapy used in one third. Left ventricular function was restored in the 25/35 of those discharged from the intensive care unit. No patient died, and all patients treated with ECMO were successfully weaned. Conclusion: Children may experience an acute cardiac decompensation due to severe inflammatory state following SARS-CoV-2 infection (multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children - MIS-C). Treatment with immune globulin appears to be associated with recovery of left ventricular systolic function.", "Encephalopathy is a poorly characterized complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). No comprehensive report of encephalopathy exists for children, and the literature contains only a few for adults. We analyzed a large cohort of 405 pediatric patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT during a 10-year period and identified 26 patients (6.4%) who experienced encephalopathy. Identifiable causes of encephalopathy included infection (n=5), single or multiorgan failure (n=4), medication-related complications (n=3), nonconvulsive seizures (n=4), acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (n=2), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (n=2), and stroke (n=1). We were unable to identify the etiology of encephalopathy in five (19%) patients. The prognosis for pediatric patients with encephalopathy was poor: only four (15%) experienced complete neurologic recovery, and 10 (38%) patients experienced partial recovery with residual neurologic deficits. Nine (35%) patients with complete or partial recovery survive long term. A total of 17 patients died; one died of progressive encephalopathy, and 16 died of either relapse of primary disease or toxicity. MRI, CSF analysis including molecular testing for infectious pathogens, and brain biopsy were helpful in obtaining a diagnosis in most of our patients. However, a standardized approach to accurate and timely diagnosis and treatment is needed to improve outcome in these patients.", "Introduction The efficacy of the endovascular treatment of acute ischemic stroke has been substantiated by several recent randomized clinical trials. While intra-arterial therapy has significantly evolved in recent years, anatomic cerebrovascular variants and disease burden can present challenges to timely recanalization. We present the first reported case of anterior-to-posterior mechanical clot retrieval with use of a stent retriever. Case description A 53-year-old man presented with basilar artery thrombosis. Endovascular mechanical clot retrieval was performed. The typical, antegrade, access to the basilar artery thrombus was precluded by the findings of a hypoplastic left vertebral artery and an occluded proximal right vertebral artery. Given a number of factors including the patient's worsening symptoms and the high morbidity and mortality associated with basilar stroke, cross-circulation-anterior-to-posterior-intra-arterial therapy was performed. Thrombectomy of the basilar thrombus was achieved via the right internal carotid artery and right posterior communicating artery. Conclusion To our knowledge, we report the first case of cross-circulation, anterior-to-posterior thrombectomy, with the use of a stent-retriever device. Cross-circulation stroke treatment may be beneficial in cases of proximal vessel occlusion or anatomical constraints. Larger studies will need to evaluate the safety and efficacy of these approaches.", "Our understanding of, and approach to, pulmonary arterial hypertension has undergone a paradigm shift in the past decade. Once a condition thought to be dominated by increased vasoconstrictor tone and thrombosis, pulmonary arterial hypertension is now seen as a vasculopathy in which structural changes driven by excessive vascular cell growth and inflammation, with recruitment and infiltration of circulating cells, play a major role. Perturbations of a number of molecular mechanisms have been described, including pathways involving growth factors, cytokines, metabolic signaling, elastases, and proteases, that may underlie the pathogenesis of the disease. Elucidating their contribution to the pathophysiology of pulmonary arterial hypertension could offer new drug targets. The role of progenitor cells in vascular repair is also under active investigation. The right ventricular response to increased pressure load is recognized as critical to survival and the molecular mechanisms involved are attracting increasing interest. The challenge now is to integrate this new knowledge and explore how it can be used to categorize patients by molecular phenotype and tailor treatment more effectively.", " Single-port laparoscopic surgery (SPLS) has been introduced for totally extraperitoneal (TEP) inguinal hernia repair. Clinically, however, the benefits of single-port TEP (SP TEP) are unclear. This study aimed to compare short-term surgical outcomes between SP TEP and conventional laparoscopic TEP(CL TEP) inguinal hernia repair. METHODS Between January 2013 and February 2015, 99 men with primary unilateral inguinal hernia were randomized to the single-port or conventional 3-port TEP procedures. The primary end point was postoperative pain. Secondary end points were complications, postoperative hospital stay, days to return to daily normal activities, cosmesis, and quality of life (QOL). RESULTS We randomized 50 patients to SP TEP and 49 to CL TEP repair. The SP TEP group patients had significantly lower pain scores (visual analog scale) 7 days postoperation (p = 0.017). However, there were no significant differences between the two groups in postoperative pain scores 24 h (p = 0.44) and 4 weeks (p = 0.677) after operation and analgesic requirements on the operation day (p = 0.303) and 7 days after the operation (p = 0.204). Operation time, postoperative hospital stay, and complications were comparable between the two groups. The days to return to daily normal activities, QOL, and cosmetic satisfaction were not different between the two groups. CONCLUSION The outcomes of SP TEP hernia repair for operation time and morbidities were comparable to CL TEP, and postoperative pain was lower at 7 days than in CL TEP hernia repair. The SP TEP technique can be recommended as an alternative treatment for inguinal hernia repair in experienced hands.", " The standard treatment of rectovaginal deep infiltrating endometriosis nodules (RVDIEN) consists in their surgical removal. RVDIEN are anatomically neovascularized. Indocyanine green (ICG) reveals vascularized structures when becoming fluorescent after exposure to near-infrared (NIR) light. This study aims to evaluate if fluorescence-guided surgery can improve the laparoscopic resection of RVDIEN, thus avoiding a rectal perforation. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients with a symptomatic RVDIEN, scheduled for a laparoscopic rectal shaving, were enrolled in the study. Technically, the RVDIEN was targeted and removed with the help of the NIR imager device Image 1 Spies (Karl Storz GmBH & Co KG, Tuttlingen, Germany) or Visera Elite II (Olympus Europe SE & Co KG, Hamburg, Germany), after an intraoperative, intravenous injection of ICG (0.25 mg/kg). RESULTS Six patients underwent a fluorescence-guided laparoscopic shaving procedure for the treatment of a nonobstructive RVDIEN. Fluorescence of the RVDIEN was observed in all the patients. In one patient, once the main lesion was removed, the posterior vaginal fornix still appeared fluorescent and was removed. No intraoperative rectal perforation occurred. The postoperative hospital stay was 2 days. No postoperative rectovaginal fistula occurred within a median follow-up of 16 months (range = 2-23 months). CONCLUSION In this preliminary study, fluorescence-guided laparoscopy appeared to help in separating the RVDIEN from the healthy rectal tissue, without rectal perforation. Moreover, this technique was helpful in deciding if the resection needed to be enlarged to the posterior vaginal fornix.", "STUDY QUESTION Is there a global consensus on the management of endometriosis that considers the views of women with endometriosis? SUMMARY ANSWER It was possible to produce an international consensus statement on the current management of endometriosis through engagement of representatives of national and international, medical and non-medical societies with an interest in endometriosis. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY Management of endometriosis anywhere in the world has been based partially on evidence-based practices and partially on unsubstantiated therapies and approaches. Several guidelines have been developed by a number of national and international bodies, yet areas of controversy and uncertainty remain, not least due to a paucity of firm evidence. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION A consensus meeting, in conjunction with a pre- and post-meeting process, was undertaken. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS A consensus meeting was held on 8 September 2011, in conjunction with the 11th World Congress on Endometriosis in Montpellier, France. A rigorous pre- and post-meeting process, involving 56 representatives of 34 national and international, medical and non-medical organizations from a range of disciplines, led to this consensus statement. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE A total of 69 consensus statements were developed. Seven statements had unanimous consensus; however, none of the statements were made without expression of a caveat about the strength of the statement or the statement itself. Only two statements failed to achieve majority consensus. The statements covered global considerations, the role of endometriosis organizations, support groups, centres or networks of expertise, the impact of endometriosis throughout a woman's life course, and a full range of treatment options for pain, infertility and other symptoms related to endometriosis. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION This consensus process differed from that of formal guideline development. A different group of international experts from those participating in this process would likely have yielded subtly different consensus statements. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS This is the first time that a large, global, consortium, representing 34 major stake-holding organizations from five continents, has convened to systematically evaluate the best available current evidence on the management of endometriosis, and to reach consensus. In addition to 18 international medical organizations, representatives from 16 national endometriosis organizations were involved, including lay support groups, thus generating input from women who suffer from endometriosis.", " There are limited data regarding the criteria for prophylactic treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) after hospital discharge. We sought to identify risk factors of post-hospital discharge VTE events following colorectal surgery. METHODS The NSQIP database was utilized to examine patients developed VTE after hospital discharge following colorectal surgery during 2005-2013. Multivariate analysis using logistic regression was performed to quantify risk factors of VTE after discharge. RESULTS We evaluated a total of 219,477 patients underwent colorectal resections. The overall incidence of VTE was 2.1 % (4556). 33.8 % (1541) of all VTE events occurred after hospital discharge. The length of postoperative hospitalization had a strong association with post-discharge VTE, with the highest risk in patients who were hospitalized for more than 1 week after operation (AOR 9.08, P < 0.01). Other factors associated with post-discharge VTE included chronic steroid use (AOR 1.81, P < 0.01), stage 4 colorectal cancer (AOR 1.40, P = 0.03), obesity (AOR 1.37, P < 0.01), age >70 (AOR 1.21, P = 0.04), and open surgery (AOR 1.36, P < 0.01). Patients who were hospitalized for more than 1 week after an open colorectal resections had a 12 times higher risk of post-discharge VTE event compared to patients hospitalized less than 4 days after a laparoscopic resection (AOR 12.34, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS VTE is uncommon following colorectal resections; however, a significant proportion occurs after patients are discharged from the hospital (33.8 %). The length of postoperative hospitalization appears to have a strong association with post-discharge VTE. High-risk patients may benefit from continued VTE prophylaxis after discharge.", " We report a case of ophthalmic artery occlusion (OAO) in a young patient with Covid-19 infection that was on therapeutic anticoagulation with apixaban for deep venous thrombosis (DVT). A 48-year-old man with obesity was hospitalized with a severe form of Covid-19 infection, complicated with acute respiratory failure, septic shock, dilated cardiomyopathy and fungemia. Despite treatment with prophylactic enoxaparin (initial D-Dimer 1.14 \u00b5g/ml FEU (normal < 0.05 \u00b5g/ml FEU), D-Dimer increased to above 20 \u00b5g/ml FEU and patient continued to spike high fevers. This prompted further investigations and upper and lower extremities DVTs were confirmed and managed with enoxaparin 1mg/kg twice daily. D-dimer level decreased to 4.98 \u00b5g/ml FEU while on therapeutic anticoagulation. Three weeks later pending hospital discharge, the anticoagulation was switched to oral apixaban 10 mg twice daily. Patient developed acute severe right eye visual loss of no light perception and was diagnosed with incomplete OAO. D-Dimer was elevated at 2.13 \u00b5g/ml FEU. Stroke etiological work-up found no embolic sources, resolution of the dilated cardiomyopathy and negative antiphospholipid antibodies. Treatment was changed to enoxaparin and no thrombotic events were encountered to date. Ocular vascular complications have not yet been reported in Covid-19. Controversy exists on the best management algorithm for the hypercoagulable state associated to Covid-19. Either direct oral anticoagulants or low-molecular-weight-heparin are considered appropriate at discharge for patients with venous thromboembolism. The optimum regimen for ischemic stroke prevention and the significance of D-Dimer for anticoagulation monitoring in Covid-19 remain unclear..", "Introduction The efficacy of the endovascular treatment of acute ischemic stroke has been substantiated by several recent randomized clinical trials. While intra-arterial therapy has significantly evolved in recent years, anatomic cerebrovascular variants and disease burden can present challenges to timely recanalization. We present the first reported case of anterior-to-posterior mechanical clot retrieval with use of a stent retriever. Case description A 53-year-old man presented with basilar artery thrombosis. Endovascular mechanical clot retrieval was performed. The typical, antegrade, access to the basilar artery thrombus was precluded by the findings of a hypoplastic left vertebral artery and an occluded proximal right vertebral artery. Given a number of factors including the patient's worsening symptoms and the high morbidity and mortality associated with basilar stroke, cross-circulation-anterior-to-posterior-intra-arterial therapy was performed. Thrombectomy of the basilar thrombus was achieved via the right internal carotid artery and right posterior communicating artery. Conclusion To our knowledge, we report the first case of cross-circulation, anterior-to-posterior thrombectomy, with the use of a stent-retriever device. Cross-circulation stroke treatment may be beneficial in cases of proximal vessel occlusion or anatomical constraints. Larger studies will need to evaluate the safety and efficacy of these approaches.", "OBJECTIVE The authors evaluate the rate and discuss the pathomechanisms of very late (\u2265 4-month) ischemic complications after flow-diverter stent (FDS) placement for intracranial aneurysms. METHODS The authors retrospectively reviewed the clinical data of the patients treated at Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re Hospital between January 2010 and September 2014, who underwent FDS placement for intracranial aneurysm. The patients received dual-antiplatelet therapy (clopidogrel and aspirin) 5 days before and 3-6 months after the procedure and then aspirin alone for 6-9 months. An ischemic complication was defined as a sudden focal neurological deficit documented on diffusion-weighted images. RESULTS Eighty-six consecutive patients were included. Three (3.5%) patients treated with the Pipeline embolization device experienced a delayed acute ischemic stroke (2 cases of perforator/side-wall branch infarction and 1 case of thromboembolic stroke) with an average delay of 384 days (4 months, 20 months, and 13 months, respectively). The aneurysm locations were the left superior cerebellar artery, the right anterior choroid artery, and the left internal carotid artery (paraclinoid segment), respectively. The complications occurred after the patients had completed the antiaggregation protocol, except for Patient 1, who was receiving aspirin alone because of a spontaneous hematoma. At the acute phase, no in-stent thromboses were found on digital subtraction angiography. In Patient 2, the treated anterior choroid artery was occluded 20 months after the procedure. In Patient 3, a focal stenosis (approximately 40%) of the distal aspect of the FDS, probably caused by intimal hyperplasia, was seen. CONCLUSIONS Very late ischemic complications after FDS treatment were observed in 3.5% of the cases in the authors' series, some of which occurred as late as more than 1 year after placement.", "Perivascularly implanted matrix embedded endothelial cells (MEECs) are potent regulators of inflammation and intimal hyperplasia following vascular injuries. Endothelial cells (ECs) in collagen scaffolds adopt a reparative phenotype with significant therapeutic potential. Although the biology of MEECs is increasingly understood, tuning of scaffold properties to control cell-substrate interactions is less well-studied. It is hypothesized that modulating scaffold degradation would change EC phenotype. Scaffolds with differential degradation are prepared by cross-linking and predegradation. Vascular injury increases degradation and the presence of MEECs retards injury-mediated degradation. MEECs respond to differential scaffold properties with altered viability in vivo, suppressed smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation in vitro, and altered interleukin-6 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression. When implanted perivascularly to a murine carotid wire injury, tuned scaffolds change MEEC effects on vascular repair and inflammation. Live animal imaging enables real-time tracking of cell viability, inflammation, and scaffold degradation, affording an unprecedented understanding of interactions between cells, substrate, and tissue. MEEC-treated injuries improve endothelialization and reduce SMC hyperplasia over 14 d. These data demonstrate the potent role material design plays in tuning MEEC efficacy in vivo, with implications for the design of clinical therapies.", "Infections following HCT are frequently related to risk factors caused by the procedure itself. Neutropenia and mucositis predispose to bacterial infections. Prolonged neutropenia increases the likelihood of invasive fungal infection. GVHD and its treatment create the most important easily identifiable risk period for a variety of infectious complications, particularly mold infections. Profound, prolonged T cell immunodeficiency, present after T cell-depleted or cord blood transplants, is the main risk factor for viral problems like disseminated adenovirus disease or EBV-related posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder.", "OBJECTIVE To assess the efficacy of linezolid compared with vancomycin in an experimental model of pneumonia induced by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in ventilated pigs. METHODS Forty pigs (30 kg) were intubated and challenged via bronchoscopy with a suspension of 106 colony forming units of MRSA into every lobe. Afterwards, pigs were ventilated up to 96 hours. Twelve hours after bacterial inoculation, the animals were randomized into 4 groups of treatment: group 1, control; group 2, vancomycin twice daily; group 3, continuous infusion of vancomycin; and group 4, linezolid. Clinical and laboratory parameters were monitored throughout the study. Bacterial cultures of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung tissue samples were performed at the end of the study. Measurements of histopathology derangements of lung samples and studies of intrapulmonary drug penetration were performed. RESULTS A total of 34 animals completed the study. No differences in clinical and laboratory parameters were observed. The percentage of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung tissue samples with positive cultures for MRSA in controls and groups 2, 3, and 4 was respectively 75%, 11%, 11%, and 0% (p < .01); 52%, 9%, 24%, and 2.5% (p < .01). Histopathology studies demonstrated signs of pneumonia in 95%, 69%, 58%, and 57% and signs of severe pneumonia in 48%, 29%, 22%, and 0% of controls and groups 2, 3, and 4, respectively (p < .01). In addition, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics profile in serum and lung tissue showed better results for linezolid compared with both vancomycin treatments. CONCLUSIONS In this animal model of MRSA pneumonia, linezolid showed a better efficacy than vancomycin showed because of a better pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics index.", " Flow diverters are increasingly used for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms. Understanding cavernous internal carotid artery (cICA) tortuosity may help to predict procedural complexities of deploying flow diverters. METHODS Pipeline embolization device (PED) neurointerventions for ICA aneurysms proximal to the ICA termination were reviewed. Cavernous ICA tortuosity was measured as a ratio D/AP, where D=height difference of the anterior and posterior genus, AP=sum of the angles of the anterior (A) and posterior (P) genus. Four types of cICA tortuosity were proposed. An analysis of variance regression and Fisher's exact test were performed to analyze differences among the types. RESULTS Cavernous ICA tortuosity was categorized into minimal (type I, n=28), moderate (type II-III, n=29), and severe (type IV, n=26). The groups were comparable for patient age (mean \u00b1 SEM years, type I: 55.6\u00b110.4, II-III: 56.4\u00b114.4, IV: 55\u00b112.8) and aneurysm size (mean\u00b1SEM mm, type I: 6.25\u00b13.5, II-III: 7.6\u00b14.9, IV: 9.11\u00b14.9). Analysis of variance demonstrated significant differences in procedural fluoroscopy time (mean \u00b1 SEM min, type I: 29.8\u00b18.4, II-III: 44.9\u00b134.1, IV: 52.6\u00b117.2, p<0.005) and mean \u00b1 SEM D/AP (type I: 0.008\u00b10.0008, II-III: 0.141\u00b10.07, IV: 0.482\u00b10.365, p<0.0001). Procedural complexity was also statistically significant (p<0.005) with 4%, 28%, and 35% of cases in types I, II-III, and IV, respectively, requiring intraprocedural PED removal or balloon post-processing of the implanted PED. CONCLUSIONS We propose a classification system for cICA tortuosity based on measurements of the anterior and posterior genu geometry. This classification correlates strongly with markers of PED procedural complexity and may be helpful in pre-procedure prognostication.", "Acute portal vein and mesenteric vein thrombosis (PVMVT) can cause acute mesenteric ischemia and be fatal with mortality rate of 37%-76%. Therefore, early diagnosis and prompt venous revascularization are warranted in patients with acute symptomatic PVMVT. Due to advances in catheter-directed treatment, endovascular treatment has been used for revascularization of affected vessels in PVMVT. We report two cases of symptomatic PVMVT treated successfully by transhepatic percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy-assisted thrombolysis.", "Inferior vena cava (IVC) thrombosis remains under-recognised as it is often not pursued as a primary diagnosis. The aetiology of IVC thrombosis can be divided into congenital versus acquired, with all aetiological factors found among Virchow's triad of stasis, injury and hypercoagulability. Signs and symptoms are related to aetiology and range from no symptoms to cardiovascular collapse. Painful lower limb swelling combined with lower back pain, pyrexia, dilatation of cutaneous abdominal wall veins and a concurrent rise in inflammatory markers are suggestive of IVC thrombosis. Following initial lower limb venous duplex, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the optimal non-invasive imaging tool. Aetiology directs treatment, which ranges from anticoagulation and lower limb compression to open surgery, with endovascular therapies increasingly favoured. The objective of this review is to assess current literature on the aetiology, presentation, investigation, treatment, prognosis and other factors pertaining to IVC thrombosis.", "OBJECTIVE To evaluate inpatient outcomes among hip fracture patients treated during the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City. DESIGN Multicenter retrospective cohort study SETTING:: One Level 1 Trauma Center and one orthopaedic specialty hospital in New York CityPatients/Participants: Fifty-nine consecutive patients (average age 85, range: 65 - 100 years) treated for a hip fracture (OTA/AO 31, 32.1) over a 5-week period, March 20, 2020 to April 24, 2020, during the height of the COVID-19 crisis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS COVID-19 infection status was used to stratify patients. The primary outcome was inpatient mortality. Secondary outcomes were admission to the intensive care unit, unexpected intubation, pneumonia, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, urinary tract infection, and transfusion. Baseline demographics, comorbidities, treatment characteristics, and COVID-related symptomatology were also evaluated. RESULTS Ten patients (15%) tested positive for COVID-19 (COVID+) (n=9; 7 preoperatively, 2 postoperatively) or were presumed positive (n=1), 40 (68%) patients tested negative, and 9 (15%) patients were not tested in the primary hospitalization. American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) scores were higher in the COVID+ group (d=-0.83; p=0.04); however, the Charlson Comorbidity Index was similar between the study groups (d=-0.17; p=0.63). Inpatient mortality was significantly increased in the COVID+ cohort (56% vs. 4%; OR 30.0, 95% CI 4.3-207; p=0.001). Including the one presumed positive case in the COVID+ cohort increased this difference (60% vs. 2%; OR 72.0, 95% CI 7.9-754; p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS Hip fracture patients with concomitant COVID-19 infection had worse ASA scores but similar baseline comorbidities with significantly higher rates of inpatient mortality compared to those without concomitant COVID-19 infection. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Prognostic Level III. See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.", "Among the different materials used as protheses for the treatment of Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (e-PTFE) plays a leading role owing to its mechanical properties as explained in the first part of this review. However, this material is poorly cell adhesive, which is expected for its contact on the abdominal face, but should display specific tissue adhesion on its thoracic exposed faced. A side specific functionalization method is hence required. The deposition of a nanosized polydopamine film on PTFE is known to be possible but immersion of the e-PTFE membrane in an aerated dopamine solution leads to a functionalization not only on both faces of the membrane but also in its porous volume. The fact that polydopamine also forms at the water/air interface has allowed to transfer a polydopamine film on only one face of the e-PTFE membrane. The deposition method and applications of such Janus like membranes are reviewed in the second part of the review.", " AND PURPOSE Intraprocedural thrombosis poses a formidable challenge during neuroendovascular procedures because the risks of aggressive thromboembolic treatment must be balanced against the risk of postprocedural hemorrhage. The aim of this study was to identify predictors of ischemic stroke after intraprocedural thrombosis after stent-assisted coiling and pipeline embolization device placement. METHODS A retrospective analysis of intracranial aneurysms treated with stent-assisted coiling or pipeline embolization device placement between 2007 and 2016 at 4 major academic institutions was performed to identify procedures that were complicated by intraprocedural thrombosis. RESULTS Intraprocedural thrombosis occurred in 34 (4.6%) procedures. Postprocedural ischemic stroke and hemorrhage occurred in 20.6% (7/34) and 11.8% (4/34) of procedures complicated by intraprocedural thrombosis, respectively. Current smoking was an independent predictor of ischemic stroke. There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of ischemic stroke or postprocedural hemorrhage with the use of abciximab compared with the use of eptifibatide in treatment of intraprocedural thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS Current protocols for treatment of intraprocedural thrombosis associated with placement of intra-arterial devices were effective in preventing ischemic stroke in \u224880% of cases. Current smoking was the only independent predictor of ischemic stroke.", "A prominent clinical feature of severe Covid\u201019 infection is respiratory failure associated with pulmonary coagulopathy. Recent reports published in Thrombosis and Haemostasis show that treatment with low\u2010molecular weight heparin (LMWH) decreases mortality in critically ill patients with sepsis\u2010induced hypercoagulation, and thus argue for prophylactic administration of the anticoagulant. In addition, the authors point to non\u2010anticoagulant activities of heparin, in particular anti\u2010inflammatory effects with potential to prevent deterioration of the disease. We would like to use this opportunity to clarify the biochemical background of the diverse activities of heparin, and further, how this information may be exploited to generate more efficient treatment of the viral infection. Mechanisms to consider relate to the functional roles of proteins interacting with heparan sulfate (HS), a polysaccharide closely related to heparin.", "Obesity is considered a worldwide health problem of epidemic proportions. Bariatric surgery remains the most effective treatment for patients with severe obesity, resulting in improved obesity-related co-morbidities and increased overall life expectancy. However, weight recidivism has been observed in a subset of patients post-bariatric surgery. Weight recidivism has significant medical, societal and economic ramifications. Unfortunately, there is a very limited understanding of how to predict which bariatric surgical patients are more likely to regain weight following surgery and how to appropriately treat patients who have regained weight. The objective of this paper is to systematically review the existing literature to assess the incidence and causative factors associated with weight regain following bariatric surgery. An electronic literature search was performed of the Medline, Embase and Cochrane library databases along with the PubMed US national library from January 1950 to December 2012 to identify relevant articles. Following an initial screen of 2,204 titles, 1,437 abstracts were reviewed and 1,421 met exclusion criteria. Sixteen studies were included in this analysis: seven case series, five surveys and four non-randomized controlled trials, with a total of 4,864 patients for analysis. Weight regain in these patients appeared to be multi-factorial and overlapping. Aetiologies were categorized as patient specific (psychiatric, physical inactivity, endocrinopathies/metabolic and dietary non-compliance) and operation specific. Weight regain following bariatric surgery varies according to duration of follow-up and the bariatric surgical procedure performed. The underlying causes leading to weight regain are multi-factorial and related to patient- and procedure-specific factors. Addressing post-surgical weight regain requires a systematic approach to patient assessment focusing on contributory dietary, psychologic, medical and surgical factors.", ": Dual antiplatelet therapy, aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor, is recommended to prevent thrombotic complications of acute coronary syndrome. Clopidogrel plus acetylsalicylic acid combination is the most commonly used dual antiplatelet therapy recommended by international guidelines and in Chinese clinical practice. Poor adherence to dual antiplatelet therapy or premature interruption of dual antiplatelet therapy is an important contributor to cardiovascular mortality and lethal cardiovascular events. Clopidogrel + acetylsalicylic acid fixed-dose combination enhances adherence to dual antiplatelet therapy. Herein, we aimed to evaluate bioequivalence of acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel in fixed-dose combination compared with simultaneous administration of their individual formulations in healthy Chinese subjects under fasting conditions. METHODS: This was a randomized, single-center, open-label, three-sequence, three-period, two-treatment, crossover study with a washout period of 10 days conducted in healthy Chinese volunteers. Subjects were randomized to receive Co-Plavix\u00ae (test formulation- fixed-dose combination of 100 mg acetylsalicylic acid and 75 mg clopidogrel) once and reference formulations (coadministration of individual formulations of 100 mg acetylsalicylic acid and 75 mg clopidogrel) twice during the study period. Pharmacokinetic parameters were analyzed for acetylsalicylic acid, its metabolite salicylic acid, clopidogrel, and its metabolite SR26334. As acetylsalicylic acid shows high intrasubject variability, the reference-scaled average bioequivalence (RSABE) approach was implemented for acetylsalicylic acid analysis, while bioequivalence of clopidogrel was assessed using the average bioequivalence method. Point ratios and confidence intervals (CIs) for AUC, AUClast, and Cmax for acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel were calculated. RESULTS: In total, 171 healthy subjects were enrolled in this study. Subjects were randomized and 170 subjects were treated with test or reference formulation; 164 subjects completed the study. Regarding acetylsalicylic acid exposure, as reference within-subject standard deviation (SDW) was at least 0.294 for acetylsalicylic acid Cmax, AUClast, and AUC, the RSABE analysis method was used to assess bioequivalence for all three parameters. The point estimates were within the 0.80-1.25 range (1.19, 1.09, and 1.04, respectively), and upper one-sided 95% CIs of scaled average bioequivalence metric were at most 0 (- 0.30, - 0.14, and - 0.10, respectively). Thus, bioequivalence was demonstrated with acetylsalicylic acid. Bioequivalence was also achieved with clopidogrel as the 90% CIs for geometric mean ratios of clopidogrel Cmax, AUClast, and AUC were within the bioequivalence range (0.80-1.25). CONCLUSION: Application of the reference-scaled average bioequivalence approach to evaluate bioequivalence of acetylsalicylic acid in Chinese male and female healthy volunteers under fasting conditions demonstrated bioequivalence of test and reference formulations. TRIAL REGISTRATION: CTR20181695.", " The technique of balloon remodeling allows the endovascular treatment of wide-neck intracranial aneurysms. For many years the only available devices were the Hyperform and the Hyperglide balloon catheters. Recently, other companies have developed newer devices, single or dual-lumen. We present our initial experience with the TransForm occlusion balloon catheter for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms. METHODS We retrospectively analysed from our prospectively gathered aneurysm database all aneurysms that were treated with balloon remodelling using TransForm occlusion balloon catheters from January 2013 to February 2014. We assessed patient demographics, morphological features of the aneurysms, procedure feasibility, technical and clinical complications. RESULTS Thirty-three patients harbouring 36 intracranial saccular aneurysms were treated during 33 procedures. Clinical finding were: 15 incidental discovery, 13 subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH), five aneurysms with mass effect, one ruptured aneurysm with SAH and mass effect, one recanalisation and one intraparenchymal haematoma. Thirty-five aneurysms were in the anterior and one in the posterior circulation. Mean dome and neck size were, respectively, 5.8 mm and 3.6 mm. Twenty-three aneurysms were treated with TransForm C and 13 with TransForm SC. We had two procedural thromboembolic complications, without permanent clinical events. No early rebleeding occurred. CONCLUSIONS In our small series, the TransForm occlusion balloon catheter seems to be safe and effective for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms, in ruptured and unruptured cases.", "The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is clinically characterized by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is responsible for a high number of patients needing mechanical ventilation or intensive care units treatment and for the elevated mortality risk. A link between COVID-19 and multiorgan failure may be dependent on the fact that most COVID-19 patients are complicated by pneumonia, which is known to be associated with early changes of clotting and platelet activation and artery dysfunction; these changes may implicate in thrombotic-related events such as myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke. Recent data showed that myocardial injury compatible with coronary ischemia may be detectable in SARS-CoV-2 patients and laboratory data exploring clotting system suggest the presence of a hypercoagulation state. Thus, we performed a systematic review of COVID-19 literature reporting measures of clotting activation to assess if changes are detectable in this setting and their relationship with clinical severity. Furthermore, we discussed the biologic plausibility of the thrombotic risk in SARS-CoV-2 and the potential use of an antithrombotic treatment.", " Lateral pancreaticojejunostomy (LPJ) is a suitable procedure to treat unremitting abdominal pain of chronic pancreatitis (CP) in the presence of a markedly dilated pancreatic duct containing stones and when an inflammatory mass in the head of the gland is absent; this procedure is rarely performed laparoscopically. CASE REPORT A 41-year-old woman with alcohol-related calcific CP and pancreatic endocrine and exocrine insufficiency suffered with opiate-dependent abdominal pain that was associated with a dilated pancreatic duct of 8.5 mm containing several calculi, but no mass in the head of the pancreas. A laparoscopic LPJ was performed successfully with no intraoperative or postoperative complications. The patient was discharged on day 5, and reported complete relief from abdominal pain at follow up 7 months later. CONCLUSIONS In selected patients, laparoscopic LPJ is feasible, safe, and effective in treating abdominal pain of CP.", " Future shortages in platelet supply are expected in Germany due to demographic changes. A rising cancer incidence will lead to an increasing demand for platelet concentrates (PCs) while the number of potential donors will decrease. Pathogen inactivation (PI) aims to inactivate various infectious agents including emerging pathogens to extend the shelf-life of PCs and reduce the frequency of acute transfusion reactions (ATRs). In this context, the clinical and economic impact of PI on platelet transfusion was evaluated. MATERIAL AND METHODS Model calculations were conducted for 2 scenarios considering different production settings. Frequencies of ATRs were based on literature analyses, platelet and ATR costs on cost analyses. RESULTS The estimated average costs for ATRs of grade 1 and 2, irrespective of origin, and grade 3 (allergic) were \u20ac 104, \u20ac 238, and \u20ac 1,200, respectively. Approximately 400 PC-related ATRs per 10(5) transfusions can be avoided, with estimated savings amounting to \u20ac 77,000. The total cost increase was calculated to approximately \u20ac 30-50 per PI-treated PC. CONCLUSION PI potentially saves plasma, prolongs shelf-life, decreases donor deferral, and reduces ATRs. Model calculations considering clinical and safety benefits of PI show a rational cost increase. The impact of PI should be further evaluated from a societal perspective regarding future blood supply and infectious disease globalization.", "OBJECTIVE. Because CT plays an important role in diagnosis, isolation, treatment, and effective evaluation of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), infection prevention and control management of CT examination rooms is important. CONCLUSION. We describe modifications to the CT examination process, strict disinfection of examination rooms, arrangement of waiting areas, and efforts to increase radiographers' awareness of personal protection made at our institution during the COVID-19 outbreak. In addition, we discuss the potential of using artificial intelligence in imaging patients with contagious diseases.", "OBJECTIVE Evaluate the efficacy of a transobturator subvesical mesh for cystocele in concomitant stress urinary incontinence (SUI). DESIGN Longitudinal observational study. SETTING Tertiary referral urogynecology center. POPULATION One hundred and five women with at least an anterior vaginal wall prolapse and concomitant SUI who underwent surgery. METHODS After reduction of prolapse elements, the intervention consisted of a non-absorbable monoprosthesis placement with two transobturator expansions and, if necessary, associated hysterectomy or infraccocygeal sacropexy. No specific procedure was performed for SUI. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES All patients had a physical examination and a subjective symptoms assessment via questionnaire in the preoperative period and at one-year or more after surgery. The pelvic organ prolapse quantification system was used for anatomical results. For SUI, Ingelman-Sundberg classification and cough test were used. Loss of urine was measured by a one-hour pad test. Functional results were evaluated by visual analog scale, quality-of-life questionnaires, including the pelvic floor distress inventory and the pelvic floor impact questionnaire. RESULTS Median follow-up was 45 months (range: 12-72). A total of 102 women (97%) were cured of their prolapse, of whom 72 (69%) were cured of their SUI and 13 (12%) showed improvement. Pad test, visual analogic scale and quality-of-life questionnaires were all improved (p < 0.05). Complications consisted of one rectal injury, one transitory urinary retention, and two hematomas. Of the erosions 6% was observed for monofilament polypropylene prostheses. CONCLUSION Transvaginal monoprosthesis for the simultaneous correction of prolapse and SUI represents an effective treatment for bulky or recurrent prolapse as well as posthysterectomy vaginal vault prolapse.", "Objective: To explore imaging characteristics of children with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on clinical data and chest CT images of 15 children diagnosed with 2019-nCoV infection. They were admitted to the Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen from January 16 to February 6, 2020. The distribution and morphology of pulmonary lesions on chest CT images were analyzed. Results: Among the 15 children, 5 were males and 10 females, aged from 4 to 14 years. Five of the 15 children were febrile and 10 were asymptomatic on the first visit. The first nasal or pharyngeal swab samples in all the 15 cases were positive for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid. For their first chest CT images, 6 patients had no lesions, while 9 patients had pulmonary inflammatory lesions. Seven cases had small nodular ground glass opacities and 2 cases had speckled ground glass opacities. After 3 to 5 days of treatment, 2019-nCoV nucleic acid in a second respiratory sample turned negative in 6 cases. Among them, chest CT images showed less lesions in 2 cases, no lesion in 3 cases, and no improvement in 1 case. The remaining 9 cases were still positive in a second nucleic acid test. Six patients showed similar chest CT inflammation, while 3 patients had new lesions, which were all small nodular ground glass opacities. Conclusions: The early chest CT images of children with 2019-nCoV infection are mostly small nodular ground glass opacities. The clinical symptoms of children with 2019-nCoV infection are nonspecific. Dynamic reexamination of chest CT and nucleic acid are important.", "The annular pancreas in adults is a rare congenital anomaly that is detected after development of complications, such as gastric outlet obstruction, recurrent pancreatitis, and peptic ulcer. Duodenal bypass is the procedure of choice for treating duodenal obstruction caused by the annular pancreas in both children and adults. Duodenoduodenostomy is routinely performed in neonates and children. In adults, duodenojejunostomy or gastrojejunostomy are recommended, because the duodenum is less mobile. We report a case of annular pancreas in a 33-year-old male that was successfully treated with laparoscopic gastrojejunostomy.", " Noncompressible hemorrhage is the leading cause of preventable death caused by hemorrhage on the battlefield. Currently, there are no hemostatic agents with the ability to control noncompressible hemorrhage. A wound stasis dressing based upon rapidly expanding cellulose minisponges (MS) was developed and tested in a lethal noncompressible model in swine, by fully transecting subclavian artery and vein. MS were compared with conventional hemostasis dressings, Combat Gauze (CG), in a randomized comparison. METHODS Sixteen 40-kg swine underwent transection of the subclavian artery and vein through a 4.5-cm aperture. After 30-second free bleeding, randomly selected MS or CG (n = 8 per group) were administered by an independent medical officer. The wound cavity was filled with either MS + no external pressure or one CG + one KERLIX gauze with 3 minutes of external pressure. One reapplication was allowed for CG. Mean arterial pressure was maintained at 60 mm Hg with 500-mL Hextend and lactated Ringer's solution intravenously administered up to a maximum of 10-L until study termination at 1 hour. RESULTS Mean pretreatment blood loss was similar for MS (719 mL) and CG (702 mL). Primary end points, namely, hemostasis at 4 minutes (MS, 75%; CG, 25%; p = 0.13), hemostasis at 60 minutes (MS, 100%; CG, 25%; p = 0.007), and survival at 60 minutes (MS, 100%; CG, 37.5%; p = 0.026), were improved with MS as were secondary end points, namely, total blood loss (MS, 118 mL; CG 1,242 mL; p = 0.021) and length of application time (MS, 25 seconds; CG, 420 seconds; p = 0.004). CONCLUSION The use of MS is a novel approach for the rapid, simple treatment of severe noncompressible hemorrhage, which provided statistically significant improvement in hemostasis and survival 60 minutes after injury and a large reduction in blood loss, resuscitation fluid requirement, and medic treatment time compared with conventional hemorrhage control dressings in a swine model.", " Across sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), HIV disproportionately affects men-who-have-sex-with-men (MSM) compared with other men of the same age group in the general population. Access to HIV services remains low among this group although several effective interventions have been documented. It is therefore important to identify what has worked well to increase the reach of HIV services among MSM. METHODS We searched MEDLINE, POPLINE and the Web of Science databases to collect published articles reporting HIV interventions among MSM across sub-Saharan Africa. Covidence was used to review the articles. The review protocol was registered in International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) - CRD42017060808. RESULTS The search identified 2627 citations, and following removal of duplicates and inclusion and exclusion criteria, only 15 papers were eligible for inclusion in the review. The articles reported various accrual strategies, namely: respondent driven sampling, known peers identified through hotspot or baseline surveys, engagement with existing community-based organizations, and through peer educators contacting MSM in virtual sites. Some programs, however, combined some of these accrual strategies. Peer-led outreach services were indicated to reach and deliver services to more MSM. A combination of peer outreach and mobile clinics increased uptake of health information and services. Health facilities, especially MSM-friendly facilities attract access and use of services by MSM and retention into care. CONCLUSIONS There are various strategies for accrual and delivering services to MSM across SSA. However, each of these strategies have specific strengths and weaknesses necessitating combinations of interventions and integration of the specific context to inform implementation. If the best of intervention content and implementation are used to inform these services, sufficient coverage and impact of HIV prevention and treatment programs for MSM across SSA can be optimized.", " Atherosclerosis in the superficial femoral artery is common in patients suffering from peripheral artery disease. Paclitaxel-eluting balloon (PEB) angioplasty, stenting, and directional atherectomy (DA) have provided new options for the treatment of superficial femoral artery disease; however, the comparative efficacy of these interventional strategies remains uncertain. METHODS One hundred and fifty-five patients with symptomatic peripheral artery disease due to de novo superficial femoral artery stenotic or occlusive lesions were randomized to treatment with plain balloon angioplasty (BA) followed by PEB angioplasty and stenting (n=48), BA and stenting (n=52), or DA with distal protection and bailout stenting (n=55). The primary end point of the study was percentage diameter stenosis after 6 months measured by angiography. Other end points included target lesion revascularization, thrombosis, ipsilateral amputation, binary restenosis, and all-cause mortality at 6 and 24 months. RESULTS Baseline and lesion characteristics were comparable in all groups with a mean lesion length of 65.9\u00b146.8 mm and 56% total occlusions. At 6 months angiography, the percent diameter stenosis was significantly lower in patients treated by PEB angioplasty and stenting (34\u00b131%) as compared with BA angioplasty and stenting (56\u00b129%, P=0.009) or DA (55\u00b129%, P=0.007). Similarly, binary restenosis was significantly lower after treatment with PEB and stenting as compared with BA and stenting or DA. Clinical follow-up at 24 months revealed a lower risk for target lesion revascularization after PEB angioplasty and stenting as compared with BA and stenting or DA. We found no difference in terms of target lesion thrombosis and mortality among groups, and no patient underwent amputation. CONCLUSIONS Treatment of de novo superficial femoral artery lesions with PEB angioplasty and stenting is superior to BA angioplasty and stenting or DA in terms of angiographic diameter stenosis at 6 months and target lesion revascularization at 24 months. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Unique identifier: NCT00986752.", " Oral anticoagulation therapy was the mainstay of deep vein thrombosis treatment but recently, catheter-directed thrombolysis has emerged as an alternative. OBJECTIVE To compare the efficacy and safety of the two strategies. METHODS Medline, Embase and Cochrane CENTRAL were reviewed. Outcomes of interest included post-thrombotic syndrome, thromboembolic events, mortality, bleeding risk and iliofemoral patency. A random effects model meta-analysis was performed. Heterogeneity was assessed with I square. RESULTS Four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including 1005 patients met the inclusion criteria. Catheter-directed thrombolysis was more likely to prevent overall post-thrombotic syndrome compared to anticoagulation only (OR: 0.32; 95% CI: 0.12-0.85; I2=87.2%), and to lead to iliofemoral vein patency (OR: 2.7; 95% CI: 1.08-6.75; I2=55.3%) but no difference was noted in thromboembolic events (OR = 0.5; 95% CI: 0.08-3.02, I2=55.1%), bleeding and mortality rates. CONCLUSIONS Catheter-directed thrombolysis can decrease post-thrombotic syndrome rates and improve iliofemoral vein patency compared to anticoagulation when used for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis.", "OBJECTIVE The emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) presents a challenge for neurologists caring for patients with preexisting neurologic conditions hospitalized for COVID-19 or for evaluation of patients who suffer neurologic complications during COVID-19 infection. We conducted a scoping review of available literature on COVID-19 to assess the potential impact on neurologists in terms of prevalent comorbidities and incidence of new neurologic events in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. METHODS We searched Medline/PubMed, CINAHL (EBSCO), and SCOPUS databases for adult patients with preexisting neurologic disease that were diagnosed and hospitalized for COVID-19, or reported incidence of secondary neurologic events following diagnosis of COVID-19. Pooled descriptive statistics of clinical data and comorbidities were examined. RESULTS Among screened articles, 322 of 4,014 (8.0%) of hospitalized patients diagnosed and treated for COVID-19 had a preexisting neurologic illness. Four retrospective studies demonstrated an increased risk of secondary neurologic complications in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (incidence of 6%, 20% and 36.4%, respectively). Inconsistent reporting and limited statistical analysis among these studies did not allow for assessment of comparative outcomes. CONCLUSION Emerging literature suggests a daunting clinical relationship between COVID-19 and neurologic illness. Neurologists need to be prepared to reorganize their consultative practices to serve the neurologic needs of patients during this pandemic.", " Laparoscopic common bile duct exploration (LCBDE) is a treatment modality for choledocholithiasis. The advantages of this technique are that it is less invasive than conventional open surgery and it permits single-stage management; however, other technical difficulties limit its use. The aim of this article is to introduce our novel technique for LCBDE, which may overcome some of the limitations of conventional LCBDE. Since December 2013, ten patients have undergone LCBDE using a V-shaped choledochotomy (V-CBD). After the confluence of the cystic duct and the CBD were exposed, a V-shaped incision was made along the medial wall of the cystic duct and the lateral wall of the common hepatic duct, which comprise two sides of Calot's triangle. The choledochoscope was inserted into the lumen of the CBD through a V-shaped incision, and all CBD stones were retrieved using a basket or a Fogarty balloon catheter or were irrigated with saline. After CBD clearance was confirmed using the choledochoscope, the choledochotomy was closed with the bard absorbable suture material known as V-loc. RESULTS The diameter of the CBD ranged from 8 to 30 mm, and the mean size of the stones was 11.6 \u00b1 8.4 mm. The mean operative time was 97.8 \u00b1 30.3 min, and the mean length of the postoperative hospital stay was 6.0 \u00b1 4.6 days. All patients recovered without any postoperative complications, except for one patient who developed postoperative pancreatitis. No conversions to laparotomy were observed, and there were no recurrent stones and no need of T-tube insertion. CONCLUSIONS This report suggests that our novel technique, known as V-CBD, may represent a feasible and straightforward procedure for treating choledocholithiasis, especially when the CBD is not dilated.", " AND PURPOSE The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is the most widely used primary outcome measure in acute stroke trials. However, substantial interobserver variability impairs outcome assessment as well as reduces power of clinical trials. Guided by the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health, we developed a comprehensive, hierarchical assessment tool (miFUNCTION) to address the shortcomings of the modified Rankin Scale and deliver a more thorough understanding of disability following stroke. METHODS The initial construct validity of miFUNCTION was established in a pilot study of patients at an outpatient stroke prevention clinic that had been diagnosed with stroke within 60 days. To further assess criterion validity, miFUNCTION was compared against the modified Rankin Scale and other outcome measures within the Endovascular Treatment for Small Core and Anterior Circulation Proximal Occlusion With Emphasis on Minimizing CT to Recanalization Times (ESCAPE) trial. Logistic regression analysis with miFUNCTION as an outcome was used to demonstrate the beneficial effect of endovascular treatment. RESULTS The pilot study showed moderate inter-observer agreement (k = 0.585, p < 0.005) but near perfect correlation between miFUNCTION and modified Rankin Scale (\u03c1 = 0.821, p < 0.05). The correlation of miFUNCTION and modified Rankin Scale was near perfect again in the ESCAPE trial (\u03c1 = 0.944). Effect size of the multivariable models using modified Rankin Scale (adjusted odds ratio: 3.45, 95% confidence interval: 2.05-5.78) and miFUNCTION (adjusted odds ratio: 3.32, 95% confidence interval: 1.99-5.55) as an outcome measure for the ESCAPE trial patients was similar. CONCLUSIONS miFUNCTION is strongly associated with the degree of disability following stroke both in an outpatient setting and a clinical trial. Further work remains to assess sensitivity to change and to improve the inter-observer reliability of the scale.", " To report a series of patients with osteoid osteoma treated by radiofrequency ablation in whom no complications or recurrences occurred. METHODS Over a 13-year period, 32 consecutive patients with osteoid osteoma were treated by radiofrequency ablation in an Australasian teaching centre. RESULTS All patients had resolution of symptoms with no complication or recurrence. CONCLUSIONS This series is further evidence for the use of radiofrequency ablation as the primary treatment for osteoid osteoma.", "OBJECTIVE Following the implementation of single-photon emission computed tomography ventilation/perfusion (SPECT V/Q) in our department, we previously carried out an observational study over the period 2011-2013 that showed the safety of SPECT V/Q to rule out pulmonary embolism (PE). However, PE prevalence (28%) was high compared with some studies. Our hypothesis was that the use of SPECT V/Q may be responsible for an overdiagnosis of PE, especially at the implementation phase of the test. The aim was to carry out a time trend analysis of the evolution over the years of PE diagnosis with SPECT V/Q. PATIENTS AND METHODS To evaluate the time trend of SPECT V/Q results, the conclusions of all SPECT V/Q scans performed for a suspected acute PE in our department from April 2011 to December 2016 were collected. To confirm the safety of a diagnostic management on the basis of SPECT V/Q to rule out PE, a retrospective observational study of the outcome of patients assessed with SPECT V/Q for suspected acute PE was carried out during the period 2014-2016. SPECT V/Q was interpreted using a diagnostic cutoff of one segmental or two subsegmental mismatches. The final diagnostic conclusion was established by the physician responsible for patient care. The safety of SPECT V/Q was assessed by monitoring the risk of thromboembolic events during the 3-month follow-up period in patients left untreated on the basis of a negative SPECT V/Q. RESULTS Over the period 2011-2016, an average 16% (95% confidence interval: 10-22%) annual reduction in the proportion of positive SPECT V/Q results was observed. The percentage of positive SPECT V/Q results was 25.3% over the period 2011-2013 compared with 16.3% in 2014-2016 (P<0.0001). Out of the 696 patients analyzed over the period 2014-2016, the SPECT V/Q was positive, indeterminate, and negative in 118, 3, and 575 patients, respectively. The 3-month thromboembolic risk in patients in whom PE was deemed absent according to the SPECT V/Q was 3/543=0.55% (95% confidence interval 0.19-1.61). CONCLUSION A continuous decrease in the annual proportion of positive SPECT V/Q results was mainly observed while maintaining the safety of the test to rule out PE. Explanatory factors include the introduction of a combined SPECT/CT scan, increased experience and familiarity with the test, and an increased awareness of the risks and consequences of overdiagnosing PE.", " Guidelines recommend long-term oral anticoagulation therapy for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Treatment discontinuation rates in vitamin K antagonist (VKA)-treated patients are high but may be lower with non-VKA oral anticoagulant agents. OBJECTIVES The goal of this study was to describe and explore predictors of dabigatran etexilate persistence in patients with newly diagnosed AF over 2 years of follow-up. METHODS Consecutive patients newly diagnosed with AF and \u22651 stroke risk factor were followed up for 2 years. Dabigatran nonpersistence was defined as discontinuation of dabigatran for >30 days. A multivariable Cox regression model included region as well as patient clinical and sociodemographic characteristics to explore predictors of nonpersistence. RESULTS Eligible patients (N = 2,932) took \u22651 dabigatran dose; their mean age was 70.3 \u00b1 10.2 years, and 55.3% were male. The 2-year probability of dabigatran persistence was 69.2%. Approximately 7% switched to a factor Xa inhibitor and 6% to a VKA. Approximately one-third of dabigatran discontinuations were primarily due to serious or nonserious adverse events. Patients from North America had the highest discontinuation risk, and Latin America had the lowest. Minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic AF and permanent AF were associated with a lower risk for dabigatran nonpersistence. Previous proton pump inhibitor use was associated with a higher risk for dabigatran nonpersistence. CONCLUSIONS Probability of treatment persistence with dabigatran after 2 years was approximately 70%. Nearly one-half of the patients who stopped dabigatran switched to another oral anticoagulant agent. Patients from North America, and those with paroxysmal, persistent, or symptomatic AF, may be at a higher risk for discontinuing dabigatran.", "Desensitisation with therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) is essential for ABO-incompatible (ABO-I) liver transplants (LTs). However, excessive citrate load and coagulation disturbances after TPE have been poorly studied, in particular in cirrhotic patients with hypocapnic alkalosis, metabolic compensation and electrolyte imbalances. We retrospectively evaluated 1123 consecutive LT recipients (923 ABO-compatible [ABO-C], 200 ABO-I) from November 2008 to May 2015. TPE was generally performed a day before LT and blood sampling was performed before anaesthesia induction. We performed propensity score matching (PSM) and inverse probability treatment weighting (IPTW) analyses. In 199 PSM pairs, metabolic alkalosis was prevalent in ABO-I LT recipients (expectedly due to citrate conversion) with higher pH \u2265 7.50 (IPTW-adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.23) than in ABO-C LT recipients. With increasing cirrhosis severity, the arterial pH and bicarbonate levels showed dose-dependent relationships, whereas mild hypoxaemia was more prevalent in ABO-I LT recipients. ABO-I LT recipients exhibited worsened hypokalaemia \u22643.0 mmol/l (17.6%, aOR = 1.44), hypomagnesaemia \u22641.7 mg/dl (27.6%, aOR = 3.43) and thrombocytopenia <30,000/\u00b5l (19.1%, aOR = 2.26) confirmed by lower maximal clot firmness (P = 0.001) in rotational thromboelastometry (EXTEM), which necessitated platelet transfusions. Preoperative identification of these change may prevent worsening of severe electrolyte disturbances and thrombocytopenia for optimal LT anaesthesia.", "The literature about tibial tuberosity advancement surgery in dogs and humans informed the development of a version of the operation using a wedge-shaped implant of titanium foam. Computer-assisted drawing and stereolithography was used to create instruments and implants that were evaluated by cadaver surgery. A trial, involving 26 client-owned dogs with lameness due to cranial cruciate ligament failure, was started. Follow-up was done by clinical and radiographic examination after 4 wk and clinical examination again 6-11 mo after surgery. The titanium foam implant maintained tibial tuberosity advancement easily and effectively. The same major complication occurred in 2 of the first 6 cases before, a slightly modified technique was used to treat 20 dogs without complication. At mid-term follow-up (6-11 mo), 20/26 dogs (77%) had returned to full function, two dogs (7.7%) had acceptable function, two dogs (7.7%) could not be evaluated due to recent contra lateral modified Maquet procedure surgery, and two (7.7%) dogs had died for reasons unrelated to the study. This is the first clinical report of the use of titanium foam in veterinary orthopaedics. Modified Maquet procedure appears to be an effective treatment for lameness due to failure of the cranial cruciate ligament in dogs.", "OBJECTIVE To describe a surgical technique for thyroidectomy in horses with thyroid neoplasia under standing sedation and local anesthesia. STUDY DESIGN Retrospective study. ANIMALS Client-owned horses (n = 10). METHODS Medical records of horses with a history of thyroid enlargement were included in the study if thyroid gland enlargement was treated surgically via hemi- or bilateral thyroidectomy, with the horse standing and sedated. Data derived from follow-up clinical examination, performance level, recurrence, and cosmetic outcome were evaluated. RESULTS Thyroid enlargement was unilateral in 8 and bilateral in 2 horses. Histopathological findings included adenomas (5/10), adenocarcinomas (2/10), cystic hyperplasia (2/10), and C-cell adenoma (1/10). No major complications were encountered during or after surgery. All horses resumed their previous level of exercise within 6 weeks. Recurrence was diagnosed in 1 horse, 7 months after excision, and a second surgery was required. Recurrent laryngeal nerve neuropathy and seroma formation subsequent to surgery were not recorded in any of the cases. CONCLUSION Thyroidectomy can safely be performed with the horse standing and sedated with local anesthesia. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Performing standing thyroidectomy does not increase intraoperative or postoperative complications and could be considered for horses with thyroid enlargement amenable to surgery.", "OBJECTIVE To determine the long-term efficacy and safety of laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) for morbid obesity. DESIGN Clinical assessment in the surgeon's office in 2009 (\u226512 years after LAGB). SETTING University obesity center in Brussels, Belgium. PATIENTS A total of 151 consecutive patients who had benefited from LAGB between January 1, 1994, and December 31, 1997, were contacted for evaluation. INTERVENTION Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Mortality rate, number of major and minor complications, number of corrective operations, number of patients who experienced weight loss, evolution of comorbidities, patient satisfaction, and quality of life were evaluated. RESULTS The median age of patients was 50 years (range, 28-73 years). The operative mortality rate was zero. Overall, the rate of follow-up was 54.3% (82 of 151 patients). The long-term mortality rate from unrelated causes was 3.7%. Twenty-two percent of patients experienced minor complications, and 39% experienced major complications (28% experienced band erosion). Seventeen percent of patients had their procedure switched to laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Overall, the (intention-to-treat) mean (SD) excess weight loss was 42.8% (33.92%) (range, 24%-143%). Thirty-six patients (51.4%) still had their band, and their mean excess weight loss was 48% (range, 38%-58%). Overall, the satisfaction index was good for 60.3% of patients. The quality-of-life score (using the Bariatric Analysis and Reporting Outcome System) was neutral. CONCLUSION Based on a follow-up of 54.3% of patients, LAGB appears to result in a mean excess weight loss of 42.8% after 12 years or longer. Of 78 patients, 47 (60.3%) were satisfied, and the quality-of-life index was neutral. However, because nearly 1 out of 3 patients experienced band erosion, and nearly 50% of the patients required removal of their bands (contributing to a reoperation rate of 60%), LAGB appears to result in relatively poor long-term outcomes.", "This article examines how health news gets framed and the influence of exposure to news framed differently. A content analysis of Taiwanese newspapers indicates that health news in general, and H1N1 flu news in particular, is more likely to use alarm rather than coping frames. According to an experiment, exposure to H1N1 flu news in an alarm frame evokes greater fear and increases perceived severity and vulnerability, though it does not help develop prevention and treatment efficacy. A survey of the general public also shows that attention and exposure to televised news coverage of the H1N1 flu are associated with greater levels of worry and perceptions of the severity of and vulnerability to this health problem, but they are not related to issue knowledge, detection, or prevention efficacy. Thus, it is important for news coverage to provide information that increases the audience's efficacy when alerting it to health threats.", "It is now common to resect colorectal cancer by laparoscopic surgery. Hepatectomy has become a standard treatment for patients with colorectal cancer with resectable liver metastases. The resection of liver tumors can now be done partly by laparoscopic surgery. However, metastatic tumors in the right lobe are often difficult to resect laparoscopically. Furthermore, simultaneous resection of the colorectum and liver may also be difficult. In this study, we evaluated a new method to resect both colorectal cancer and liver metastases in the right lobe by laparoscopic surgery. Two cases are presented that underwent total laparoscopic resection of a right lobe tumor, associated with laparoscopic colorectal resection. The metastatic tumor in the right lobe was first resected in the left hemi-prone position. Then, the colorectal cancer was resected in the lithotomy position. The method for resecting the right lobe liver tumor and colorectal cancer was safe and feasible. The mean duration of surgery was 443.5 min, and the mean blood loss was 158 mL. The postoperative course was uneventful. In selected patients, laparoscopic hepatectomy for right lobe synchronous metastatic tumors can be safely performed simultaneously with colorectal surgery.", "Obesity is considered a worldwide health problem of epidemic proportions. Bariatric surgery remains the most effective treatment for patients with severe obesity, resulting in improved obesity-related co-morbidities and increased overall life expectancy. However, weight recidivism has been observed in a subset of patients post-bariatric surgery. Weight recidivism has significant medical, societal and economic ramifications. Unfortunately, there is a very limited understanding of how to predict which bariatric surgical patients are more likely to regain weight following surgery and how to appropriately treat patients who have regained weight. The objective of this paper is to systematically review the existing literature to assess the incidence and causative factors associated with weight regain following bariatric surgery. An electronic literature search was performed of the Medline, Embase and Cochrane library databases along with the PubMed US national library from January 1950 to December 2012 to identify relevant articles. Following an initial screen of 2,204 titles, 1,437 abstracts were reviewed and 1,421 met exclusion criteria. Sixteen studies were included in this analysis: seven case series, five surveys and four non-randomized controlled trials, with a total of 4,864 patients for analysis. Weight regain in these patients appeared to be multi-factorial and overlapping. Aetiologies were categorized as patient specific (psychiatric, physical inactivity, endocrinopathies/metabolic and dietary non-compliance) and operation specific. Weight regain following bariatric surgery varies according to duration of follow-up and the bariatric surgical procedure performed. The underlying causes leading to weight regain are multi-factorial and related to patient- and procedure-specific factors. Addressing post-surgical weight regain requires a systematic approach to patient assessment focusing on contributory dietary, psychologic, medical and surgical factors.", "Implantable long-term central venous port systems (CVPS) are widely used as a permanent means of accessing the vascular system for intravenous delivery of drugs, parenteral nutrition, blood transfusion, and blood sampling. These systems allow easy and repetitive puncture without causing much damage to the vessels. However, the body foreign surface of CVPS induces an inflammatory response with varying intensity (depending on the implant materials) that leads to formation of a fibrous tissue capsule around the implant. This study was designed to investigate the influence of bacterial infection on the tissue reaction induced by implanted CVPS in adult patients. 20 patients (9 women, 11 men, 58 \u00b1 14 yrs of age) were included in this study. These patients received explantation of a polysulfone based CVPS (ChemoSite\u2122, Covidien, Mansfield, USA) due to port related infections (patients with bacterial infections at the implantation site: group A, 5 men, 1 women) or to other reasons such as termination of treatment, thrombosis, or CVPS dysfunction (patients without bacterial infections, group B, 6 men, 8 women) 299.9 \u00b1 261.2 days after CVPS implantation. A sample of the encapsulating tissue covering the CVPS together with surrounding tissue (at least 1 \u00d7 1 cm2) was placed in a small container with fixing agent, a buffered neutral 4% formalin solution (pH 7). Histological sections of the samples were prepared for light microscopic analysis after paraffin embedding. Sections of 3 \u03bcm were cut and stained with haematoxylin and eosin, Weigert's elastic stain, and Heidenhain's azan stain. There was no difference in thickness, collagen and elastin content, or cell and capillary density of the fibrous capsule between both groups. Due to the wound healing reaction involving angiogenesis and fibroblast activation cell density and number of capillaries in the capsule tissue of all patients showed a positive correlation (r = 0.45, p < 0.05). However, the study demonstrated that at the end of the foreign body reaction the artificial tissue layer which covers the CVPS after implantation due to foreign body reaction shows only low reactivity towards infections.", "OBJECTIVE To describe the use of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) in adults presenting with status asthmaticus to Middlemore Hospital Critical Care Complex (CCC, South Auckland, New Zealand) from 2000 to 2015. METHOD Retrospective review of all adult asthma admissions to the Hospital CCC between 2000 and 2015. Demographic, physiological, treatment data and blood gas results were recorded. RESULTS There were 265 asthma admissions to Middlemore Hospital CCC during the study period. The median age was 34 years; 64% were female. NIV was used in 186 admissions, of which eight went on to require intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). Twenty-three other admissions received IMV without a trial of NIV and a further 58 were managed with medical care only. The average pH for all admissions was 7.23 and the IMV group had an average pH of 6.99. Forty-five admissions presented with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of \u226410. Twenty-five of these were managed with NIV with only one requiring subsequent intubation. The mean duration of NIV in this group was 5 h (range 1-17 h) with a mean ICU and hospital length of stay of 17 h and 3.5 days, respectively. All patients in this group effectively lowered the pCO2 over a 2 h period with NIV having an average drop of 5.9 kPa and IMV 3.4 kPa. CONCLUSION The use of NIV appears to be safe and effective in patients with severe asthma, including selected patients with an altered level of consciousness. NIV was well tolerated with a low need for subsequent intubation.", "Treatment of complex aneurysms using microsurgical and other conventional neuroendovascular techniques remains challenging. As a result, stent- and balloon-assisted coiling are instead performed to treat morphologically complex aneurysms, which include giant, wide-necked, and fusiform aneurysms. While these techniques have had success in treating these complex aneurysms, recanalization rates associated with these techniques are still problematic. In the constant effort to improve the outcome of complex aneurysm treatment, flow-diverting stents (FDSs) have emerged in recent years as the preferred treatment. Instead of directly obstructing the flow of blood into the aneurysmal sac, as is the case for stent- and balloon-assisted coiling, FDSs are placed in the parent blood vessel to divert blood flow away from the aneurysm itself. Subsequent to the diverting away of blood from the aneurysm, a thrombotic cascade ensues that ultimately results in the closure of the aneurysm while the parent vessel's perforators are preserved. Current known risks for this procedure include vessel rupture or perforation, in-stent thrombosis, perforator occlusion, procedural or delayed hemorrhages, and perianeurysmal edema. In this review, we will evaluate the mechanisms of actions, clinical applications, complications, and ongoing studies for FDSs.", "Intestinal transplantation has become a well-accepted and successful procedure to save the lives of patients suffering from intestinal failure and who have developed life-threatening complications of parenteral nutrition. Advances in all aspects of care, from the role of multidisciplinary intestinal rehabilitation services prior to transplant to the development strategies for early recognition of infectious sequelae and even the increasing availability of preventive strategies, have led to improved outcomes and a dramatic decline in infection-associated morbidity and mortality in children undergoing intestinal transplantation. Improvements in surgical techniques and immunosuppressive regimens have been essential components in these improvements, reducing risk of infection through reduction of technical complications and more optimal immunosuppression regimens. In addition, the development of molecular tools for early recognition of viral pathogens and an understanding of the timing and risks for infection have allowed for earlier and more successful treatments. Despite these improvements, infectious sequelae remain an important problem in this population, and additional efforts are needed to further minimize the risk of infectious sequelae in those children requiring this procedure.", " An online survey was conducted to characterize current infection management practices in Italian intensive care units (ICUs), including the antibacterial and antifungal drug regimens prescribed for various types of infections. METHODS During February and March 2011, all 450 ICUs in public hospitals in Italy were invited to take part in an online survey. The questionnaire focused on ICU characteristics, methods used to prevent, diagnose, and treat infections, and antimicrobials prescribing policies. The frequency of each reported practice was calculated as a percentage of the total number of units answering the question. The overall response rate to the questionnaire was 38.8% (175 of the 450 ICUs contacted) with homogeneous distribution across the country and in terms of unit type. RESULTS Eighty-eight percent of the responding facilities performed periodical surveillance cultures on all patients. In 71% of patients, cultures were also collected on admission. Endotracheal/bronchial aspirates were the most frequently cultured specimens at both time points. Two-thirds of the responding units had never performed screening cultures for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Around 67% of the ICUs reported the use of antimicrobial de-escalation strategies during the treatment phase. In general, the use of empirical antimicrobial drug regimens was appropriate. Although the rationale for the choice was not always clearly documented, the use of a combination therapy was preferred over antibiotic monotherapy. The preferred first-line agents for invasive candidiasis were fluconazole and an echinocandin (64% and 25%, respectively). Two-thirds of the ICUs monitored vancomycin serum levels and administered it by continuous infusion in 86% of cases. For certain antibiotics, reported doses were too low to ensure effective treatment of severe infections in critically ill patients; conversely, inappropriately high doses were administered for certain antifungal drugs. CONCLUSIONS Although infection control policies and management practices are generally appropriate in Italian ICUs, certain aspects, such as the extensive use of multidrug empirical regimens and the inappropriate antimicrobial dosing, deserve careful management and closer investigation.", "PURPOSE To examine patient outcomes following the use of the Lutonix drug-coated balloon (DCB) in patients undergoing endovascular intervention in below-the-knee (BTK) arteries. METHODS A retrospective chart review identified 248 patients who were treated for symptomatic peripheral artery disease with the Lutonix DCB between May 2013 and October 2014. Forty patients were lost to follow-up, leaving 208 patients (mean age 74.1\u00b19.7 years; 138 men) with evaluable data for outcome analysis. The patient cohort suffered from either severe claudication (38.6%) or critical limb ischemia (CLI; 61.4%) in 220 limbs. Almost two-thirds (140, 63.6%) of the 220 target lesions were total occlusions, and 37 (17.8%) of all patients had occlusion of all 3 BTK vessels before intervention. RESULTS Over a median 9-month follow-up, target lesion revascularization occurred in 15.9% of patients with an average time to first reintervention of 8 months. In total, 39 amputations were performed in 31 limbs. However, 17 of these amputations were preplanned minor amputations below the ankle; only 9 (4.1%) major amputations occurred corresponding to 6.6% of the CLI cohort. Freedom from the composite of death or major amputation was estimated as 92% and 85% at 6 and 12 months, respectively, by Kaplan-Meier analysis. In the full cohort, improvement of at least 1 Rutherford category was seen in 130 (59.1%) limbs after 1 year or at the last follow-up, with 104 (80.0%) of those limbs showing an improvement of \u22652 categories. CONCLUSION From this single-center experience, the Lutonix DCB shows therapeutic promise in a disease state where new treatment options are needed.", "OBJECTIVES To describe our buried penis repair technique that includes penile release, tissue resection, wound closure, and penile reconstruction. PATIENTS AND METHODS In all, 73 patients were treated from 2007 to 2017. Patients can be categorised into five stages: Stage I, involves only a phimotic band; Stage 2, required excision of diseased penile skin with split-thickness skin grafting (STSG); Stage 3, requires scrotal excision; Stage 4, requires escutcheonectomy; and Stage 5, requires panniculectomy. Successful treatment hinges on adequate excision of diseased skin and de-bulking followed by replacement of deficient skin with STSG. RESULTS In all, 36 of 73 (49%) patients had Stage 1-3 disease, whilst 37 of 73 (51%) were Stage 4-5. There were complications within the first 30 days in 44 of 73 (60%) patients. In all, 62 of 73 (85%) patients either had no complications or Clavien-Dindo grade I-II complications and nine (12%) had complications beyond 30 days. Only five of 36 (14%) patients with Stage 1-3 disease had complications. One patient developed recurrent phimosis. CONCLUSION The buried penis is a challenging surgical entity where conservative treatment will most likely lead to failure. Surgery is the only means for a lasting cure in these patients and should be used as a first-line treatment. One should expect complications postoperatively, especially within the first 30 days; however, these are mostly limited to Clavien-Dindo grade I-II complications.", "Background and Aims The GEMINI long-term safety [LTS] study is a continuing phase 3 trial investigating the safety and efficacy of vedolizumab, an \u03b14\u03b27 integrin antagonist for ulcerative colitis [UC] and Crohn's disease. We provide an interim analysis of efficacy in patients with UC. Methods Patients from the C13004 and GEMINI 1 studies and a cohort of vedolizumab-na\u00efve patients received open-label vedolizumab every 4 weeks. Interim data were collected from May 22, 2009 to June 27, 2013. Clinical response and remission, evaluated using partial Mayo scores, and health-related quality of life [HRQL] were assessed for up to 152 weeks of cumulative treatment in the efficacy population. Results As of June 27, 2013, 63% of the efficacy population [n = 532/845] were continuing treatment. Among patients who responded to vedolizumab induction and had data available, 88% [n = 120/136] were in remission after 104 weeks of exposure (96% [n = 70/73] after 152 weeks). Among patients who withdrew from every-8-week vedolizumab maintenance in GEMINI 1 [n = 32] before week 52, increased dosing to every 4 weeks in GEMINI LTS resulted in response and remission rates of 41% and 28%, respectively, after 52 weeks, an increase from 19% and 6%, respectively, from before the dose increase. Similar benefits were demonstrated regardless of prior tumour necrosis factor-antagonist exposure. Durable benefits on HRQL were also observed. Conclusions Patients with UC experienced clinical and HRQL improvements with continued vedolizumab treatment. Increased dosing frequency to every 4 weeks was beneficial in patients who had loss of response to 8-weekly dosing.", "Treatment-resistant hypertension, or resistant hypertension, is defined as blood pressure that remains above target despite concurrent use of at least three antihypertensive agents from different classes at optimal doses, one of which should be a diuretic. Important considerations in the diagnosis of treatment-resistant hypertension include the exclusion of pseudoresistance and the evaluation of potential secondary causes of hypertension and of concomitant conditions that maintain high blood pressure. The ability to diagnose true treatment-resistant hypertension is important for selection of patients who may be appropriately treated with an invasive therapy. Currently, there are three interventional approaches to treat resistant hypertension, namely: (1) reduction of the activity of the sympathetic nervous system by renal nerve ablation, (2) stimulation of baroreceptors and (3) creation of a peripheral arterial venous anastomosis. This review focuses on the rationale behind these invasive approaches and the clinical results.", "PURPOSE To compare the bone healing, clinical, and return to daily activity outcomes after either surgical or conservative management of acute zone 1, 2, and 3 fifth metatarsal fractures. METHODS A literature search was performed to identify studies published from the earliest record to January 2019 using EMBASE (Ovid), MEDLINE via PubMed, CINAHL, and Web of Science. All articles assessing clinical outcomes of acute proximal fifth metatarsal fractures were included. Bone healing and clinical outcomes were thereafter calculated using a simplified pooling method. RESULTS Thirty-two articles comprising of a total of 1,239 fractures were included, of which one was a randomized controlled trial, seven were prospective studies, and 24 were retrospective studies. 627 zone 1 fractures demonstrated union rates of 93.2% following conservative treatment and 95.1% following surgical treatment. Conservatively managed zone 1 fractures were displaced 49.5% of the time, compared to a rate of 92.8% for the surgically treated cases. For Jones' (zone 2) fractures, bone healing outcomes of conservative versus surgical treatment showed union rates of 77.4% versus 96.3%, refracture rates of 2.4% versus 2.1%, and mean time to union of 11.0 weeks versus 9.4 weeks, respectively. Only ten proximal diaphyseal (zone 3) fractures were reported, with a mean return to work of 8.2 weeks. CONCLUSION Acute zone 1 fractures are preferably treated conservatively as similar union rates were found after both conservative and surgical management. In contradistinction, acute zone 2 fractures demonstrate higher union rates and faster time to union when treated surgically. The outcomes of acute zone 3 fractures are rarely reported in the literature, so treatment recommendations remain unclear. Further research of proximal fifth metatarsal fractures is warranted to provide more definitive conclusions, but current findings can aid surgeons during the shared clinical decision making process. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE IV.", "AIM The aim of this study was to investigate the capacity of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSC), grown in serum-free conditions, to regenerate bone around titanium discs with different titanium surfaces. MATERIAL AND METHODS Ovine ADSC (oADSC) were isolated from seven sheep and cultured using serum-free and osteogenic conditions. Prior to in vivo testing, the growth and osteogenic behaviour of these cells were analysed in vitro using cell proliferation and extracellular matrix mineralisation assays. The bone regenerative capacity of autologous oADSC was evaluated in vivo on titanium discs in a sheep femur epicondyle model. Machined (MTi) and alumina-blasted (ABTi) titanium discs were used. Bone regeneration within the defects was evaluated after 1 month using histology and histomorphometry. PKH26 cell-tracking dye was used to verify the persistence of oADSC in the surgical wound. RESULTS oADSC sourced from five of seven sheep differentiated into osteoblast-like cells. Cellular proliferation was reduced only for osteogenically induced oADSC (oOS-ADSC) grown on ABTi, compared to non-induced oADSC grown on ABTi and tissue culture polystyrene (P = 0.03 and 0.02 respectively). There was no significant difference for in vitro mineralisation assays comparing oADSC with oOS-ADSC, regardless of implant surface type. oADSC labelled with PKH26 were detected 1 month after surgery within the defect. There was no difference in bone regeneration between the bone defects treated with oADSC vs. just blood clot. CONCLUSION After 1-month healing, the use of autologous oADSC did not improve bone regeneration in defects containing titanium devices with different surfaces.", " Basilar artery occlusion (BAO) is a rare stroke subtype with high mortality rates. Best BAO reperfusion strategy is still controversial. OBJECTIVE We aim to describe outcomes of BAO patients submitted to mechanical thrombectomy (MT) in a comprehensive stroke center in Brazil and analyze which previous published computed tomography angiography (CTA) collateral score better predict functional outcomes. METHODS Retrospective analysis of consecutive BAO patients. CTA was used to evaluate the posterior circulation collateral score (PC-CS), the basilar artery on CTA score, and for the presence of posterior communicating arteries. A favorable outcome was defined as modified Rankin Score \u22643 at 90-days. After univariate analyses, multivariate logistic regression was used to identify if any collateral score independently predicts favorable outcomes. RESULTS Between January 2011 and April 2017, 27 (85% male) BAO patients with median NIHSS 26 (IQR 15-32) were identified. Twenty-five (93%) patients were treated with MT devices, and only 2 (7%) patients were treated with angioplasty and stenting. Successful recanalization rate was 85%, and only 1 (3.7%) patient had symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation. Favorable outcomes were reached in 10 (37%) patients. In univariate analysis, female sex, NIHSS, Glasgow coma scale, mild-to-moderate symptoms on admission, onset-to-groin time, and PC-CS predicted favorable outcomes. In multivariate analysis, PC-CS (OR 1.69; 95% CI 1.10-2.60; p = 0.016) and NIHSS (OR 0.84; 95% CI 0.77-0.93; p = 0.001) remained the only independent predictors of favorable outcomes. The PC-CS AUC was 0.80 (95% CI 0.62-0.98; p = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS MT is a promising strategy for BAO treatment. Among collateral scores, PC-CS was the only independent predictor of favorable outcomes in the present study.", "OBJECTIVES Osteoarthritis is a chronic disease characterized by irreversible damage to joint structures, including loss of articular cartilage, osteophyte formation, alterations in the subchondral bone and synovial inflammation. It has been shown that chondroitin sulfate interferes with the progression of structural changes in joint tissues and is used in the management of patients with osteoarthritis. METHODS This review summarizes data from relevant reports describing the mechanisms of action of chondroitin sulfate that may explain the beneficial effects of the drug and examines the evidence for clinical efficacy of oral chondroitin sulfate in osteoarthritis. Data included in the review were derived from a literature search in PubMed. Literature searches were performed in PubMed using the search terms 'chondroitin sulfate', 'pharmaceutical-grade', 'osteoarthritis', 'randomized clinical trials', 'humans'. The MEDLINE database was searched from January 1996 through August 2012 for all randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and review articles of chondroitin sulfate in osteoarthritis. RESULTS Chondroitin sulfate exerts in vitro a beneficial effect on the metabolism of different cell lines: chondrocytes, synoviocytes and cells from subchondral bone, all involved in osteoarthritis. It increases type II collagen and proteoglycan synthesis in human articular chondrocytes and is able to reduce the production of some pro-inflammatory factors and proteases, to reduce the cellular death process, and improve the anabolic/catabolic balance of the extracellular cartilage matrix (ECM). Clinical trials have reported a beneficial effect of chondroitin sulfate on pain and function. The structure-modifying effects of chondroitin sulfate have been reported and analyzed in recent meta-analyses. The results in knee osteoarthritis demonstrate a small but significant reduction in the rate of decline in joint space width. Because chondroitin sulfate quality of several nutraceuticals has been found to be poor, it is recommended that pharmaceutical-grade chondroitin sulfate is used rather than food supplements in the treatment of OA. Chondroitin sulfate is recommended by several guidelines from international societies in the management of knee and hip OA. Furthermore, its safety profile is favorable when compared with many other therapies used in OA. CONCLUSION Chondroitin sulfate is an effective and safe treatment option for patients with osteoarthritis.", " Acute bronchitis (AB) is a highly contagious infection of the airways, presenting mostly in connection with common cold (CC). There is a high variance in duration and course of symptoms which, sooner or later, also may disappear spontaneously and change during the course of the disease. Therefore, assessment of treatment outcome is difficult. METHODS Composite outcome measures are commonly used to examine the effects of pharmacotherapy in complex diseases. We discuss the features of the Bronchitis Severity Scale (BSS) on the basis of the available literature. RESULTS For the BSS the five most important symptoms of AB are rated by the patient and the physician. Since its introduction in 1996, the BSS has been used in many clinical trials evaluating treatment effects of AB. Its score correlates well with clinical findings. As thorough validation analyses revealed, this applies even more to the BSS subscales \"cough domain\" and \"sputum domain\". CONCLUSION The validated BSS appears to be a reliable tool to assess therapeutic effects in CC/AB. The BSS and its subscales are recommended as outcome measures for future drug trials in CC/AB, but also help physicians to focus their consultation in patients with CC/AB.", "OBJECTIVE A rare complication of neuroendovascular procedures is acute thromboembolism. In the setting of intraprocedural or periprocedural embolism, thrombolytics present a potentially useful therapeutic strategy. A series of patients in whom eptifibatide (a platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitor) was used in the treatment of iatrogenic thromboembolic events occurring during elective neuroendovascular procedures is described. METHODS Consecutive cases between May 2009 and July 2011 in which eptifibatide was administered were identified and individually reviewed for inclusion in this study (n=12). All study patients received a uniform, weight based bolus dose of 180 \u03bcg/kg of eptifibatide administered either intra-arterially through the guide catheter or intravenously. Eptifibatide infusion (2 \u03bcg/kg/min) for 24 h after bolus dose administration was continued at the discretion of the surgeon. Procedural details are described and illustrative cases presented. RESULTS Three major categories of thromboembolic events were isolated in the course of review of study cases: acute focal neurological decline and no radiographic findings of flow limitation (eight patients), radiographic findings with or without symptoms (two patients) and persistent particulate debris during flow reversal as part of a carotid revascularization procedure (two patients). Following eptifibatide administration, no patient experienced hemorrhagic complications, and neurologic improvement to baseline level was noted in 10 of 12 patients. CONCLUSION Eptifibatide may be an effective therapeutic strategy in the event of thromboembolism during elective neuroendovascular procedures.", "OBJECTIVE Most reviews of pharmacological strategies for delirium treatment evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions for delirium prevention, reduction in duration and severity of ongoing delirium, and other outcomes that extend beyond the recommendations of expert treatment guidelines. However, little if any attention is given to substantiating the potential benefits of such treatment or addressing the methodological weaknesses that, in part, limit the pharmacological recommendations made by expert treatment guidelines. Therefore, the authors conducted a systematic review to provide the most up-to-date and inclusive review of published prospective trials of potential pharmacological interventions for the prevention and treatment of delirium, and they discuss potential benefits of pharmacological prevention of delirium and/or reduction of ongoing delirium episode duration and severity. METHOD The analysis followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, including prospective randomized and nonrandomized double-blind, single-blind, and open-label clinical trials of any pharmacological agent for the prevention or treatment of delirium and reviewing them systematically for effectiveness on several predefined outcomes. RESULTS The pharmacological strategies reviewed showed greater success in preventing delirium than in treating it. Significant delirium prevention effects are associated with haloperidol, second-generation antipsychotics, iliac fascia block, gabapentin, melatonin, lower levels of intraoperative propofol sedation, and a single dose of ketamine during anesthetic induction and with dexmedetomidine compared with other sedation strategies for mechanically ventilated patients. CONCLUSIONS These promising results warrant further study with consideration of the methodological weaknesses and inconsistencies of studies to date.", " Primary epithelial ovarian carcinoma is sub-classified into serous, mucinous, endometrioid and clear cell subtypes. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has become an alternative treatment option past several years, as serous carcinoma, the most common subtype, is known as chemotherapy-sensitive tumor. On the other hand, mucinous and clear cell carcinoma are known as chemotherapy-resistive. Therefore, it may be meaningful to estimate subtype of ovarian carcinoma using imaging modality. The purpose of this study is to study whether CT or MRI can determine the subtypes of epithelial ovarian cancers. METHODS The imaging and clinical findings obtained from 125 consecutive patients with primary ovarian carcinoma were retrospectively analyzed. Forty-four of the patients had serous carcinoma; 13, mucinous carcinoma; 53, clear cell carcinoma; and 15, endometrioid carcinoma. We studied the bilateralism, morphological type, tumor diameter, solid portion ratio, relative signal intensity on T2WI and DWI, contrast ratio, and endometriosis on MRI and the calcification, peritoneal dissemination and lymph node metastasis, clinical staging, and thromboembolism on CT. We also studied the tumor markers and serum calcium concentrations. Each parameter was statistically analyzed by univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS Serous carcinoma showed a significantly higher incidence of bilateral disease, smaller tumor size, higher signal intensity on DWI, and less frequent hypercalcemia. The CA19-9 level was significantly higher in mucinous carcinoma, in which most of the tumors appeared as multilocular cystic masses. Clear cell carcinoma appeared as unilateral disease with a larger solid portion and hypercalcemia in younger patients. Endometrioid carcinoma only showed a lower incidence of intraperitoneal dissemination. CONCLUSIONS CT and MRI combined with clinical data especially tumor markers and presence of paraneoplastic syndrome could partly predict epithelial ovarian cancer subtypes.", " AND PURPOSE The Safety and Efficacy of NeuroFlo Technology in Ischemic Stroke trial showed a trend for reduced all-cause mortality and positive secondary safety end point outcomes. We present further analyses of the mortality and severe disability data from the Safety and Efficacy of NeuroFlo Technology in Ischemic Stroke trial. MATERIALS AND METHODS The Safety and Efficacy of NeuroFlo Technology in Ischemic Stroke trial was a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial that evaluated the safety and effectiveness of the NeuroFlo catheter in patients with stroke. The current analysis was performed on the as-treated population. All-cause and stroke-related mortality rates at 90 days were compared between groups, and logistic regression models were fit to obtain ORs and 95% CIs for the treated versus not-treated groups. We categorized death-associated serious adverse events as neurologic versus non-neurologic events and performed multiple logistic regression analyses. We analyzed severe disability and mortality by outcomes of the mRS. Patient allocation was gathered by use of a poststudy survey. RESULTS All-cause mortality trended in favor of treated patients (11.5% versus 16.1%; P = .079) and stroke-related mortality was significantly reduced in treated patients (7.5% versus 14.2%; P = .009). Logistic regression analysis for freedom from stroke-related mortality favored treatment (OR, 2.41; 95% CI, 1.22, 4.77; P = .012). Treated patients had numerically fewer neurologic causes of stroke-related deaths (52.9% versus 73.0%; P = .214). Among the 90-day survivors, nominally fewer treated patients were severely disabled (mRS 5) (5.6% versus 7.5%; OR, 1.72; 95% CI, 0.72, 4.14; P = .223). Differences in allocation of care did not account for the reduced mortality rates. CONCLUSIONS There were consistent reductions in all-cause and stroke-related mortality in the NeuroFlo-treated patients. This reduction in mortality did not result in an increase in severe disability.", "AIM To report the results of an open label prospective study on a new technique for laparoscopic hiatal hernia (HH) repair with absorbable mesh fixed with absorbable materials Methods: From January 2011 to May 2013, 43 patients were treated; group A, 20 patients submitted to laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG); group B, 13 patients submitted to revisional surgery for the diagnosis of HH and symptomatic GERD post-LSG; and group C, ten patients submitted to 360\u00b0 fundoplication. All patients underwent cruroplasty reinforced with bio-absorbable mesh fixed with absorbable tacks and/or fibrin glue. Conversion rate, intra-operative complications, operative time (tacks vs tacks plus fibrin glue), perioperative complications, perioperative symptoms and radiological control set the criteria for clinical/surgical evaluation. RESULTS Conversion and mortality rate was 0%. The mean time for mesh fixation with the tacks vs tacks plus fibrin glue was 6.2 \u00b1 2 vs 7.3 \u00b1 3 min. The remission of GERD symptoms was observed in 39 patients, and we did not observe any cases of mesh-related complications at a mean follow-up of 17.4 months. Recurrence rate was 2.3% (one asymptomatic patient of group B). CONCLUSIONS Reinforcement with absorbable mesh-cancel bio mesh is a safe and effective option for laparoscopic HH repair in normal weight and obese patients.", "PURPOSE The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of microwave (MW) ablation of liver metastases guided by B-mode ultrasound (US) and contrast-enhanced US (CEUS). MATERIALS AND METHODS 39 patients (17 women and 22 men) with a total of 125 liver metastases were treated with percutaneous or intraoperative CEUS-guided MW ablation. The primary tumor was colorectal cancer (n = 31), breast cancer (n = 6), carcinoid tumor (n = 1), and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) (n = 1). The median number of metastases ablated in the 45 treatment sessions was 2 (range 1 - 11). The median size (maximum diameter) of the 125 metastases was 1.5 cm (range, 0.6 - 4.0 cm). Nineteen (15 %) of the 125 metastases were bigger than 2 cm. Metastases smaller than 2 cm were treated with a single needle, metastases bigger than 2 cm were treated with 2 or 3 parallel needles. RESULTS The 45 MW ablation sessions were performed percutaneously (n = 30), during laparotomy (n = 3), or during laparotomy combined with liver resection (n = 12). The 39 patients were followed up for at least 4 months with a median duration of 11 months (range, 4 - 20 months). The technical success rate was 100 %. The clinical effectiveness was 100 % with complete coverage of the metastasis by the avascular coagulation zone evaluated on immediate post-ablation CEUS. Local tumor progression (local recurrence) was seen in 12 (9.6 %) of the 125 treated metastases, and affected 10 (26 %) of the 39 patients. One major complication was observed in the form of a liver abscess that easily resolved after percutaneous drainage. Four minor complications were observed: Three cases of pain located at the puncture site and one case of ascites. CEUS was valuable in all phases of ablation including pre-ablation staging and procedure planning, placement of MW needles in the tumor, immediate post-ablation control of coagulation size, and finally in the long term follow-up regime. CONCLUSION CEUS-guided MW ablation of liver metastases is an efficient and safe ablation technique with several advantages compared to other ablation modalities.", "ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is the most acute manifestation of coronary artery disease and is associated with great morbidity and mortality. A complete thrombotic occlusion developing from an atherosclerotic plaque in an epicardial coronary vessel is the cause of STEMI in the majority of cases. Early diagnosis and immediate reperfusion are the most effective ways to limit myocardial ischaemia and infarct size and thereby reduce the risk of post-STEMI complications and heart failure. Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has become the preferred reperfusion strategy in patients with STEMI; if PCI cannot be performed within 120 minutes of STEMI diagnosis, fibrinolysis therapy should be administered to dissolve the occluding thrombus. The initiation of networks to provide around-the-clock cardiac catheterization availability and the generation of standard operating procedures within hospital systems have helped to reduce the time to reperfusion therapy. Together with new advances in antithrombotic therapy and preventive measures, these developments have resulted in a decrease in mortality from STEMI. However, a substantial amount of patients still experience recurrent cardiovascular events after STEMI. New insights have been gained regarding the pathophysiology of STEMI and feed into the development of new treatment strategies.", "Because cases of highly pathogenic influenza are rare, no systematic clinical studies have evaluated different therapeutic approaches. Instead, treatment recommendations are aimed at the alleviation of clinical signs and symptoms, especially the restoration of respiratory function, and at the inhibition of virus replication, assuming viral load is responsible for disease phenotype. Studies of highly pathogenic influenza in different animal models, especially nonhuman primates and ferrets, reproduce many of the key observations from clinical cases. Host-response kinetics reveal a delayed but broad activation of genes involved in the innate and acquired immune responses (innate responses produce inflammatory responses), which continue after the virus has been cleared and may contribute importantly to the clinical signs observed. Experimental animal models point to an important role for immune dysregulation in the pathogenesis of highly pathogenic influenza. The use of these models to develop and validate therapeutic approaches is just beginning, but published studies reveal the importance of early treatment with antivirals and show the potential and limitations of approaches aimed at the host response.", "Many industrial chemicals and their respective by-products need to be comprehensively evaluated for toxicity using reliable and efficient assays. In terms of teratogenicity evaluations, the murine-based embryonic stem cell test (EST) offers a promising solution to screen for multiple tissue endpoints. However, use of a mouse model in the EST can yield only a limited understanding of human development, anatomy, and physiology. Non-human primate or human in vitro models have been suggested to be a pharmacologically and pathophysiologically desirable alternative to murine in vitro models. Here, we comparatively evaluated the sensitivity of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) of a non-human primate to skeletal teratogens with mouse ESCs hypothesizing that inclusion of non-human primate cells in in vitro tests would increase the reliability of safety predictions for humans. First, osteogenic capacity was compared between ESCs from the mouse and a New World monkey, the common marmoset. Then, cells were treated with compounds that have been previously reported to induce bone teratogenicity. Calcification and MTT assays evaluated effects on osteogenesis and cell viability, respectively. Our data indicated that marmoset ESCs responded differently than mouse ESCs in such embryotoxicity screens with no obvious dependency on chemical or compound classes and thus suggest that embryotoxicity screening results could be affected by species-driven response variation. In addition, ESCs derived from rhesus monkey, an Old World monkey, and phylogenetically closer to humans than the marmoset, were observed to respond differently to test compounds than marmoset ESCs. Together these results indicate that there are significant differences in the responses of non-human primate and mouse ESC to embryotoxic agents.", "Landiolol is an intravenous ultra-short acting beta-blocker which has been used in Japan for many years to prevent and/or to treat post-operative atrial fibrillation following cardiac surgery. The drug is now available in Europe. This article is a systematic review of literature regarding the use of landiolol in that specific surgical setting.", "CONCLUSION Patients with risk factors including younger age, mastoiditis, external ear disease, treatment by older surgeons, and concomitant mastoidectomy should receive detailed management to minimize the probability of re-operation for chronic otitis media (COM). OBJECTIVES Although COM remains a common ear disease requiring surgical intervention, its re-operation risks are less well-documented. This study aimed to compare patients with COM who underwent re-operation and those patients with no re-operation, and identify the risks of re-operation. METHOD This retrospective cohort study analyzed the trend of COM surgery from 1999-2009, and identified the re-operation risks of 18 895 patients with COM who underwent surgery from 2002-2006 using the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. RESULTS Among the study population, 129 patients underwent revision surgery during a 5.5 \u00b1 1.5 year follow-up period. A univariate logistic regression analysis showed that the re-operation rate was significantly higher in patients under 18 years of age, those with mastoiditis, disorders of external ear, treatment by surgeons of 50-64 years of age, use of a very high volume surgeon, and combined surgery with mastoidectomy. A multivariate analysis further limited the re-operation risk factors to younger patients, those with mastoiditis, external ear disorders, treatment by older surgeons, and concomitant mastoidectomy.", " AND PURPOSE Stent-assisted coiling has expanded the treatment of intracranial aneurysms. With the use of continuously compiled data, we reviewed the role and drawbacks of stent-assisted coiling. MATERIALS AND METHODS We compiled data from consecutive patients from 2003-2012 who underwent coiling, with or without stent assistance. Clinical and angiographic results were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS Of 1815 saccular aneurysms in 1505 patients, 323 (17.8%) were treated with stents (299 procedures) and 1492 (82.2%) without stents (1400 procedures). Procedure-related complications occurred in 9.4% with stents versus 5.6% without stents (P = .016, relative risk 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1-2.7). Ischemic complications were more frequent in the stent group than in the no-stent group (7.0% versus 3.5%; P = .005; relative risk, 1.7; 95% CI 1.2-2.5), as were hemorrhagic complications (2.3% versus 1.9%, P = .64). Procedure-induced mortality occurred in 2.7% (8/299) with stents versus 1.1% (15/1400) without stents (P = .029; relative risk, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.1-3.5). Logistic regression analysis identified wide-neck aneurysms as the most significant independent predictor of complications. A total of 64.1% (207/323) of aneurysms treated with stents and 70.3% (1049/1492) treated without stents have been followed, disclosing angiographic recurrence in 15.5% (32/207) versus 35.5% (372/1049), respectively (P < .0001). Logistic regression analysis showed that the presence of a stent was the most important factor for the reduction of angiographic recurrence (P < .0001; relative risk, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.6-3.3). CONCLUSIONS The stent-assisted coiling technique is associated with a significant decrease in recurrences but a significant increase in complications. The treatment of wide-neck aneurysms remains hazardous.", " Endovascular treatment of wide-necked aneurysms is challenging. Stent-assisted coiling (SAC) is associated with increased complications and requires dual antiplatelet therapy. OBJECTIVE To compare treatment of unruptured, wide-necked aneurysms with a dual-microcatheter technique (DMT) versus SAC. METHODS Between 2006 and 2011, 100 patients with unruptured wide-necked intracranial aneurysms were treated with DMT and 160 with SAC. Over time there was a significant decrease in the use of SAC and a corresponding increase in DMT. The investigators matched 60 patients treated with DMT blinded to outcome in a 1:2 fashion based on maximal aneurysm dome diameter with 120 patients treated with SAC. Outcomes were determined with conditional (matched) multivariate analysis. RESULTS There were no significant differences in patient or aneurysm characteristics between cohorts, including aneurysm diameter, neck width, or volume. Overall packing density and coil volume achieved was not significantly different between cohorts. There were higher rates of overall complications in those receiving SAC (19.2%) compared with DMT (5.0%; p=0.012), but no significant difference in major complications (8.3% vs 1.7%, respectively; p=0.103). At a mean follow-up of 27.0 \u00b1 18.9 months, rates of retreatment did not differ between DMT (15.1%) and SAC (17.7%). Delayed in-stent stenosis occurred in five patients and in-stent thrombosis in four patients treated with SAC. There was no difference in favorable functional outcome (modified Rankin score 0-2) between those treated with DMT (90.6%) compared with SAC (91.2%). CONCLUSIONS DMT and SAC are effective endovascular approaches for unruptured, wide-necked aneurysms; however, DMT may result in less morbidity. Further long-term studies are necessary to determine the optimal indications for these treatment options.", " Catheter-related thrombotic complications(TCs) can occur during the long term use of a chronic dialysis catheter (CDC), including fibrin sheath (FS), mural thrombosis (MT), venous thrombosis (VT), and intraluminal clots (IC), which has not been reported with MRI. The aim of our study was to evaluate the determination of catheter tip position (TP) and resolution of TCs in patients with transjugular CDC scheduled into the superior vena cava using high resolution magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (HR-MRCP) and T2-weighted imaging (HR-T2WI). METHODS The study protocol was approved by the local Research Ethics Committee. Informed consent was obtained from all patients. In total, 41 consecutively enrolled transjugular CDC patients with suspected catheter dysfunction were scanned with HRMRCP and HR-T2WI. The distance from the top to the tip of the catheter and the presence and nature of catheter TCs were assessed by 2 experienced radiologists. Chest x-ray was taken within 1 to 2 days and CDC was withdrawn within 3 to 10 days from those patients with TCs identified by HR-MRI. RESULTS A total of 38 subjects successfully underwent HR-MRI, including 13 normal and 25 with TCs (fibrin sheath [FS]: n = 21, mural thrombosis [MT]: n = 7, venous thrombosis [VT]: n = 3, intraluminal clots [IC]: n = 4). There was no significant difference between HR-MRCP and chest x-ray in catheter TP determination (P = .124). Normal catheter appeared as \"double eyes\" on HR-T2WI and \"double tracks\" on HR-MRCP. TCs appeared as follows: FS displayed as a \"thin ring\" (<1mm) around the catheter, MT as patchy hyperintensity and VT as a \"thick ring\" (>5mm) on HR-T2WI. Unilateral IC appeared as a \"single eye\" on HR-T2WI and a \"single track\" on HR-MRCP (n = 3). Bilateral IC appeared as neither \"eye\" nor \"track\" (n = 1). Catheter withdrawal confirmed FS (n = 16), MT (n = 6), VT (n = 1), and IC (n = 4). CONCLUSION HR-MRCP and HR-T2WI are promising methods for visualizing TP and TCs in CDC patients, and are helpful in adjusting the treatment plan and avoiding the risk of pulmonary embolism.", "Inferior vena cava (IVC) thrombosis remains under-recognised as it is often not pursued as a primary diagnosis. The aetiology of IVC thrombosis can be divided into congenital versus acquired, with all aetiological factors found among Virchow's triad of stasis, injury and hypercoagulability. Signs and symptoms are related to aetiology and range from no symptoms to cardiovascular collapse. Painful lower limb swelling combined with lower back pain, pyrexia, dilatation of cutaneous abdominal wall veins and a concurrent rise in inflammatory markers are suggestive of IVC thrombosis. Following initial lower limb venous duplex, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the optimal non-invasive imaging tool. Aetiology directs treatment, which ranges from anticoagulation and lower limb compression to open surgery, with endovascular therapies increasingly favoured. The objective of this review is to assess current literature on the aetiology, presentation, investigation, treatment, prognosis and other factors pertaining to IVC thrombosis.", "Background: Chemotherapy is the main treatment for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), which lack molecular markers for diagnosis and therapy. Cancer cells activate chemoresistant pathways and lead to therapeutic failure for patients with TNBC. Several kinases have been identified as chemoresistant genes. However, the involvement of kinases in the chemoresistance in TNBC cells is not fully understood. Methods: We employed a kinome siRNA library to screen whether targeting any kinases could increase the chemosensitivity of TNBC cell lines. The effects of kinase on cell viability in various breast cancer cells were validated with ATP level and colony formation. Protein expression and phosphorylation were determined by immunoblotting. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset was collected to analyze the correlation of Src expression with prognosis of TNBC patients. Results: Primary screening and validation for the initial hits showed that Src kinase was a potential doxorubicin-resistant kinase in the TNBC cell lines MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T. Both siRNA against Src and the Src inhibitor dasatinib enhanced the cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin in TNBC cells. Moreover, phosphorylation of AKT and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), downstream effectors of Src, were accordingly decreased in Src-silenced or -inhibited TNBC cells. Additionally, TCGA data analysis indicated that Src expression levels in tumor tissues were higher than those in tumor-adjacent normal tissues in patients with TNBC. High co-expression level of Src and STAT3 was also significantly correlated with poor prognosis in patients. Conclusion: Our results showed that Src-STAT3 axis might be involved in chemoresistance of TNBC cells.", "Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We describe the case of a 59-year-old man who presented with headache, hypertension and a single episode of fever with no other symptoms. He subsequently developed unilateral weakness. Computer tomography identified a cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST). A subsequent test for COVID-19 was positive. This is the first report of CVST as a presenting symptom of COVID-19 infection. LEARNING POINTS: Thrombotic events may be the initial presenting symptom of COVID-19. These thrombotic events include stroke, venous thromboembolism, pulmonary embolism and cardiac complications. Clinicians should carefully consider the risk of thrombosis in patients positive for COVID-19, including prophylaxis and treatment beyond discharge.", "Currently, it is necessary to deal with issues related to the emissions as there is a constantly increasing interest in combusting sludge from sewage treatment plants in the boilers for wood. An analysis of the energetic importance of the combustion of sewage sludge has already been carried out, but the effects of various treatments of the sludge are not always clear, e.g. composting and subsequent combustion to the air pollution. Investments in other thermal processes of energetic utilisation of sewage sludge and organic waste are not always successfully implemented. The objective of this paper is to point out some problematic cases for acceptance of thermal processes related to energetic use of waste in terms of the air protection. The other aim is to mention the experience with solutions of such issues in Slovakia. There are mentioned first results of the operational validation experiments during the energy generation in circulating fluidized bed boiler in peaking power plant (Power 110MW) with the addition of the so-called alternative fuel based on wood and sewage sludge to the main fuel - black coal (anthracite). And there has already been achieved the highest share of 12.4%w. (dry matter) of sewage sludge in form of compost in blend with black coal, which is technologically viable. Moreover analyzed the problems of the authorization and operation of the co-combustion of sewage sludge and of combustion of products of various kinds of pyrolysis waste - pyrolysis gas and pyrolysis oil are analyzed.", " Extremely preterm infants born at the border of viability (22-24 weeks' gestation) have high rates of death and lasting disability. Ex vivo uterine environment therapy is an experimental neonatal intensive care strategy that provides gas exchange using parallel membranous oxygenators connected to the umbilical vessels, sparing the extremely preterm cardiopulmonary system from ventilation-derived injury. OBJECTIVE In this study, we aimed to refine our ex vivo uterine environment therapy platform to eliminate fetal infection and inflammation, while simultaneously extending the duration of hemodynamically stable ex vivo uterine environment therapy to 1 week. STUDY DESIGN Merino-cross ewes with timed, singleton pregnancies were surgically delivered at 112-115 days of gestation (term is \u223c150 days) and adapted to ex vivo uterine environment therapy (treatment group; n = 6). Physiological variables were continuously monitored; humerus and femur length, ductus arteriosus directional flow, and patency were estimated with ultrasound; serial blood samples were collected for hematology and microbiology studies; weight was recorded at the end of the experiment. Control group animals (n = 7) were euthanized at 122 days of gestation and analyzed accordingly. Bacteremia was defined by positive blood culture. Infection and fetal inflammation was assessed with white blood cell counts (including differential leukocyte counts), plasma and lung proinflammatory cytokine measurements, and lung histopathology. RESULTS Five of 6 fetuses in the treatment group completed the 1-week study period with key physiological parameters, blood counts remaining within normal ranges, and no bacteremia detected. There were no significant differences (P > .05) in arterial blood oxygen content or lactate levels between ex vivo uterine environment therapy and control groups at delivery. There was no significant difference (P > .05) in birthweight between control and ex vivo uterine environment groups. In the ex vivo uterine environment group, we observed growth of fetal humerus (P < .05) and femur (P < .001) over the course of the 7-day experimental period. There was no difference in airway or airspace morphology or consolidation between control and ex vivo uterine environment animals, and there was no increase in the number of lung cells staining positive for T-cell marker CD3+. CONCLUSION Five preterm lambs were maintained in a physiologically stable condition for 1 week with significant growth and without clinically significant bacteremia or systemic inflammation. Although substantial further refinement is required, a life support platform based around ex vivo uterine environment therapy may provide an avenue to improve outcomes for extremely preterm infants.", "Arytenoid cartilage dislocation is not a common complication, but its delayed diagnosis reduces the therapeutic effect of treatment. A male patient underwent reversed total shoulder replacement surgery in the beach chair position under general anesthesia. The patient experienced postoperative hoarseness, and it was revealed that he had right arytenoid dislocation. Voice restoration was accomplished with closed reduction. We discussed changes in patient position during the operation and how they may contribute to the arytenoid dislocation. Flexion and a slight rotation of the neck during the operation can lead to an increase in intracuff pressure of the endotracheal tube. It is necessary to check neck position and monitor intracuff pressure in patients undergoing operations in the beach chair position. Also, the anesthesiologist should suspect arytenoid dislocation in the case of persistent hoarseness after surgery in the beach chair position.", "The paper examines the effects of anaesthesia on circulatory physiology and their implications regarding improvement in perioperative anaesthetic management. Changes to current anaesthetic practice, recommended recently, such as the use of flow monitoring in high risk patients, are already beginning to have an impact in reducing complications but not mortality [1]. Better understanding of the patho-physiology should help improve management even further. Analysis of selected individual clinical trials has been used to illustrate particular areas of patho-physiology and how changes in practice have improved outcome. There is physiological support for the importance of achieving an appropriate rate of oxygen delivery (DO2), particularly following induction of anaesthesia. It is suggested that ensuring adequate DO2 during anaesthesia will avoid development of oxygen debt and hence obviate the need to induce a high, compensatory, DO2 in the post-operative period. In contrast to the usual assumptions underlying strategies requiring a global increase in blood flow [1] by a stroke volume near maximization strategy, blood flow control actually resides entirely at the tissues not at the heart. This is important as the starting point for understanding failed circulatory control as indicated by 'volume dependency'. Local adjustments in blood flow at each individual organ - auto-regulation - normally ensure the appropriate local rate of oxygen supply, i.e. local DO2. Inadequate blood volume leads to impairment of the regulation of blood flow, particularly in the individual tissues with least capable auto-regulatory capability. As demonstrated by many studies, inadequate blood flow first occurs in the gut, brain and kidney. The inadequate blood volume which occurs with induction of anaesthesia is not due to blood volume loss, but probably results from redistribution due to veno-dilation. The increase in venous capacity renders the existing blood volume inadequate to maintain venous return and pre-load. Blood volume shifted to the veins will, necessarily, also reduce the arterial volume. As a result stroke volume and cardiac output fall below normal with little or no change in peripheral resistance. The resulting pre-load dependency is often successfully treated with colloid infusion and, in some studies, 'inotropic' agents, particularly in the immediate post-operative phase. Treatment during the earliest stage of anaesthesia can avoid the build up of oxygen debt and may be supplemented by drugs which maintain or restore venous tone, such as phenylephrine; an alternative to volume expansion. Interpretation of circulatory patho-physiology during anaesthesia confirms the need to sustain appropriate oxygen delivery. It also supports reduction or even elimination of supplementary crystalloid maintenance infusion, supposedly to replace the \"mythical\" third space loss. As a rational evidence base for future research it should allow for further improvements in anaesthetic management.", " Angiomyolipoma (AML) is the most common renal benign tumor. Treatment should be considered for symptomatic patients or for those at risk for complications, especially retroperitoneal bleeding which is correlated to tumor size, grade of the angiogenic component and to the presence of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). This study reports our single-center experience with the use of selective arterial embolization (SAE) in the management of symptomatic and asymptomatic renal AMLs. METHODS In this retrospective mono-centric study, all demographic and imaging data, medical records, angiographic features, outpatient charts and follow-up visits of patients who underwent prophylactic or emergency SAE for AMLs between January 2005 and July 2016 were reviewed. Tumor size and treatment outcomes were assessed at baseline and after the procedure during follow-up. Computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or ultrasonography was used to evaluate AML shrinkage. Renal function was measured pre- and post-procedure. RESULTS Twenty-three patients (18 females, 5 males; median age, 45 years; range, 19-85 years) who underwent SAE either to treat bleeding AML (n=6) or as a prophylactic treatment (n=17) were included. Overall, 34 AMLs were embolized. TSC status was confirmed for 6 patients. Immediate technical success rate was 96% and 4 patients benefitted from an additional procedure. Major complications occurred in 3 patients and minor post-embolization syndrome (PES) in 14 patients. The mean AML size reduction rate was 26.2% after a mean follow-up was 20.5 months (range, 0.5-56 months), and only non-TSC status was significantly associated with better shrinkage of tumor (P=0.022). Intralesional aneurysms were significantly more frequent in patients with hemorrhagic presentation (P=0.008). There was no change in mean creatinine level after SAE. CONCLUSIONS SAE is a safe and effective technique to manage renal AMLs as a preventive treatment as well as in emergency setting, with significant reduction in tumor size during follow-up. A multidisciplinary approach remains fundamental, especially for TSC patients. In addition to size, the presence of intralesional aneurysms should be considered in any prophylactic treatment decision.", " Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banded plication (LAGBP) is a novel bariatric procedure, and little is known about its potential complications. OBJECTIVES Herein, we report on complications of LAGBP and discuss the clinical features and diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in such situations, with emphasis on gastric fold herniation (GFH). SETTING University Hospital. METHODS Prospectively collected data of 223 patients who underwent LAGBP for morbid obesity between August 2009 and December 2014 were retrospectively analyzed. Follow-up at 1 year was 75%. RESULTS Eight patients (3.5%) required readmission due to major complications, including 1 trocar site hernia, 1 band leak, 1 gastric stenosis, and 5 GFHs. GFHs occurred mostly in the first postoperative month (4/5, 80%) and at the fundus (5/5, 100%); 4 GFHs occurred in the initial 70 patients. Seven laparoscopic reoperations were required for managing GFH. The gastric band was removed in 3 patients (of 5; 60%). Two patients developed residual intra-abdominal abscess and were treated successfully by image-guided drainage. In March 2012, we reversed the order of our surgical techniques for the subsequent 153 patients and performed greater curvature plication first, followed by band placement. Only one GFH occurred after this change in surgical order (1/153 versus 4/70; P< .05). CONCLUSIONS High clinical suspicion assisted by radiological investigations and early surgical intervention is the key for managing GFH after LAGBP. Though GFH complications were rare, we significantly reduced its occurrence by altering the surgical order in LAGBP to plication followed by banding.", "We propose a highly-simplified single-alveolus mechanistic model of lung mechanics and gas mixing that leads to an analytical solution for carbon dioxide partial pressure in exhaled breath, as measured by time-based capnography. Using this solution, we estimate physiological parameters of the lungs on a continuous, breath-by-breath basis. We validate our model with capnograms from 15 subjects responding positively (>20% FEV1 drop from baseline) to methacholine challenge, and subsequently recovering with bronchodilator treatment. Our results suggest that parameter estimates from capnography may provide discriminatory value for lung function comparable to spirometry, thus warranting more detailed study.", "Lateral periodontal cysts (LPCs) are odontogenic epithelial cysts composed of nonkeratinized epithelial cells that are in the category of developmental cysts, rather than inflammatory cysts. Lateral periodontal cysts are rare both in people and domestic animals; they are associated with vital teeth and located lateral to a tooth root. Lateral periodontal cysts are typically asymptomatic lesions that are characterized radiographically as a unilocular lucency with well-defined corticated borders. Canine acanthomatous ameloblastoma (CAA) is the most common odontogenic neoplasm in dogs and rarely presents as a cystic lesion. This case report describes the diagnosis and treatment of a cyst that occurred as a swelling apical to a gingival mass that was diagnosed histologically as CAA. Surgical management by conservative gingivectomy, cyst enucleation, and bone grafting was an effective treatment in this patient.", "OBJECT Flow diversion via Pipeline Embolization Device (PED) represents the most recent advancement in endovascular therapy of intracranial aneurysms. This exploratory study aims at a proof of concept for an advanced device-modeling tool in conjunction with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to evaluate flow modification effects by PED in actual, treated cases. METHODS The authors performed computational modeling of 3 PED-treated complex aneurysm cases. The patient in Case 1 had a fusiform vertebral aneurysm treated with a single PED. In Case 2 the patient had a giant internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysm treated with 2 PEDs. Case 3 consisted of tandem ICA aneurysms (III-a and III-b) treated by a single PED. The authors' recently developed high-fidelity virtual stenting (HiFiVS) technique was used to recapitulate the clinical deployment process of PEDs in silico for these 3 cases. Pretreatment and posttreatment aneurysmal hemodynamics studies performed using CFD simulation were analyzed. Changes in aneurysmal flow velocity, inflow rate, wall shear stress (WSS), and turnover time were calculated and compared with the clinical outcome. RESULTS In Case 1 (occluded within the first 3 months), the aneurysm had the most drastic flow reduction after PED placement; the aneurysmal average velocity, inflow rate, and average WSS were decreased by 76.3%, 82.5%, and 74.0%, respectively, whereas the turnover time was increased to 572.1% of its pretreatment value. In Case 2 (occluded at 6 months), aneurysmal average velocity, inflow rate, and average WSS were decreased by 39.4%, 38.6%, and 59.1%, respectively, and turnover time increased to 163.0%. In Case 3, Aneurysm III-a (occluded at 6 months) had a decrease by 38.0%, 28.4%, and 50.9% in average velocity, inflow rate, and average WSS, respectively, and turnover time increased to 139.6%, which was quite similar to Aneurysm II. Surprisingly, the adjacent Aneurysm III-b had more substantial flow reduction (a decrease by 77.7%, 53.0%, and 84.4% in average velocity, inflow rate, and average WSS, respectively, and an increase to 213.0% in turnover time) than Aneurysm III-a, which qualitatively agreed with angiographic observation at 3-month follow-up. However, Aneurysm III-b remained patent at both 6 months and 9 months. A closer examination of the vascular anatomy in Case 3 revealed blood draining to the ophthalmic artery off Aneurysm III-b, which may have prevented its complete thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that HiFiVS modeling of flow diverter deployment enables detailed characterization of hemodynamic alteration by PED placement. Posttreatment aneurysmal flow reduction may be correlated with aneurysm occlusion outcome. However, predicting aneurysm treatment outcome by flow diverters also requires consideration of other factors, including vascular anatomy.", "Following reovirus infection, cells activate stress responses that repress canonical translation as a mechanism to limit progeny virion production. Work by others suggests that these stress responses, which are part of the integrated stress response (ISR), may benefit rather than repress reovirus replication. Here, we report that compared to untreated cells, treating cells with sodium arsenite (SA) to activate the ISR prior to infection enhanced viral protein expression, percent infectivity, and viral titer. SA-mediated enhancement was not strain-specific, but was cell-type specific. While SA pre-treatment of cells offered the greatest enhancement, treatment within the first 4 h of infection increased the percent of cells infected. SA activates the heme-regulated eIF2\u03b1 (HRI) kinase, which phosphorylates eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2\u03b1) to induce stress granule (SG) formation. Heat shock (HS), another activator of HRI, also induced eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation and SGs in cells. However, HS had no effect on percent infectivity or viral yield but did enhance viral protein expression. These data suggest that SA pre-treatment perturbs the cell in a way that is beneficial for reovirus and that this enhancement is independent of SG induction. Understanding how to manipulate the cellular stress responses during infection to enhance replication could help to maximize the oncolytic potential of reovirus.", "The guidewire (GW) is probably the most important tool for the endovascular treatment of arterial obstructions. In fact, the treatment of a lesion is only possible when the GW is passed beyond the target lesion. Lower limb percutaneous arterial revascularisation can be achieved using a variety of GWs which may differ in calibre, body, tip or coating. As the choice of an appropriate GW is critical for the success of a lower limb artery angioplasty, knowledge of the properties and performances of different GWs should be well known in order to tailor the choice of the device to the lesion characteristics and location, as well as to the intended revascularisation strategy. The aim of the present paper is to describe the constructive characteristics of GWs for lower limb arterial revascularisation, and to evaluate groups of GWs for each segment of the lower limb arterial vasculature.", " Primary epithelial ovarian carcinoma is sub-classified into serous, mucinous, endometrioid and clear cell subtypes. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has become an alternative treatment option past several years, as serous carcinoma, the most common subtype, is known as chemotherapy-sensitive tumor. On the other hand, mucinous and clear cell carcinoma are known as chemotherapy-resistive. Therefore, it may be meaningful to estimate subtype of ovarian carcinoma using imaging modality. The purpose of this study is to study whether CT or MRI can determine the subtypes of epithelial ovarian cancers. METHODS The imaging and clinical findings obtained from 125 consecutive patients with primary ovarian carcinoma were retrospectively analyzed. Forty-four of the patients had serous carcinoma; 13, mucinous carcinoma; 53, clear cell carcinoma; and 15, endometrioid carcinoma. We studied the bilateralism, morphological type, tumor diameter, solid portion ratio, relative signal intensity on T2WI and DWI, contrast ratio, and endometriosis on MRI and the calcification, peritoneal dissemination and lymph node metastasis, clinical staging, and thromboembolism on CT. We also studied the tumor markers and serum calcium concentrations. Each parameter was statistically analyzed by univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS Serous carcinoma showed a significantly higher incidence of bilateral disease, smaller tumor size, higher signal intensity on DWI, and less frequent hypercalcemia. The CA19-9 level was significantly higher in mucinous carcinoma, in which most of the tumors appeared as multilocular cystic masses. Clear cell carcinoma appeared as unilateral disease with a larger solid portion and hypercalcemia in younger patients. Endometrioid carcinoma only showed a lower incidence of intraperitoneal dissemination. CONCLUSIONS CT and MRI combined with clinical data especially tumor markers and presence of paraneoplastic syndrome could partly predict epithelial ovarian cancer subtypes.", ": Since December, 2019, Wuhan, China, has experienced an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described. METHODS: In this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (\u226518 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors. We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death. FINDINGS: 191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital. 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients). Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1\u00b710, 95% CI 1\u00b703\u20131\u00b717, per year increase; p=0\u00b70043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5\u00b765, 2\u00b761\u201312\u00b723; p<0\u00b70001), and d-dimer greater than 1 \u03bcg/mL (18\u00b742, 2\u00b764\u2013128\u00b755; p=0\u00b70033) on admission. Median duration of viral shedding was 20\u00b70 days (IQR 17\u00b70\u201324\u00b70) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors. The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days. INTERPRETATION: The potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 \u03bcg/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage. Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.

These diseases are caused by the Leishmania species complex. Activation of the CD8+ T cell is crucial for protection against intracellular pathogens, and peptide antigens are attractive strategies for the precise activation of CD8+ T in vaccine development against intracellular infections. The traditional approach to mine the epitopes is an arduous task. However, with the advent of immunoinformatics, in silico epitope prediction tools are available to expedite epitope identification. In this study, we employ different immunoinformatics tools to predict CD8+ T cell specific 9 mer epitopes presented by HLA-A*02 and HLA-B40 within the highly conserved 3'-ectonucleotidase of Leishmania donovani. We identify five promiscuous epitopes, which have no homologs in humans, theoretically cover 85% of the world's population and are highly conserved (100%) among Leishmania species. Presentation of selected peptides was confirmed by T2 cell line based HLA-stabilization assay, and three of them were found to be strong binders. The in vitro peptide stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from cured HLA-A02+ visceral leishmaniasis (VL) subjects produced significantly higher IFN-\u03b3, IL-2 and IL-12 compared to no peptide control healthy subjects. Further, CD8+ cells from treated VL subjects produced significantly higher intracellular IFN-\u03b3, lymphocyte proliferation and cytotoxic activity against selected peptides from the PBMCs of treated HLA-A02+ VL subjects. Thus, the CD8+ T cell specific epitopes shown in this study will speed up the development of polytope vaccines for leishmaniasis.", "PURPOSE Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (SG) has gained popularity and acceptance among bariatric surgeons, mainly due its low morbidity and mortality. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of SG on weight loss, and to determine the postoperative course, clinical presentation and treatment of complications after SG. METHODS Between January 2006 and October 2012, 153 consecutive patients underwent SG. All data were prospectively collected in a computerized database. RESULTS This series comprised 119 females and 34 males with a median age of 46 years and a median preoperative BMI of 42.3 kg/m2. The median EWL was 53.0 % after 18.4 months of follow-up. The median postoperative BMI was 33.3 kg/m2 (range 19.7\u201356.1 kg/m2). Eight patients (5.2 %) required re-laparoscopy to manage postoperative hemorrhage (3.3 %) and leakage (1.9 %). Neither abdominal drains nor postoperative contrast-swallow studies were successful in diagnosing hemorrhage or leaks in our patients. CONCLUSION SG is an effective procedure to achieve significant short-term weight loss. Clinical signs, such as tachycardia, pain, fever and hypotension, provide the best evidence of the presence of postoperative leakage or bleeding. An early diagnosis of these complications is the key to ensuring adequate treatment with immediate re-laparoscopy.", "Marburg virus (MARV) and Ebola virus (EBOV), members of the family Filoviridae, represent a significant challenge to global public health. Currently, no licensed therapies exist to treat filovirus infections, which cause up to 90% mortality in human cases. To facilitate development of antivirals against these viruses, we established two distinct screening platforms based on MARV and EBOV reverse genetics systems that express secreted Gaussia luciferase (gLuc). The first platform is a mini-genome replicon to screen viral replication inhibitors using gLuc quantification in a BSL-2 setting. The second platform is complementary to the first and expresses gLuc as a reporter gene product encoded in recombinant infectious MARV and EBOV, thereby allowing for rapid quantification of viral growth during treatment with antiviral compounds. We characterized these viruses by comparing luciferase activity to virus production, and validated luciferase activity as an authentic real-time measure of viral growth. As proof of concept, we adapt both mini-genome and infectious virus platforms to high-throughput formats, and demonstrate efficacy of several antiviral compounds. We anticipate that both approaches will prove highly useful in the development of anti-filovirus therapies, as well as in basic research on the filovirus life cycle.", "Patients with acute limb ischemia, deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary artery embolism may be treated with warfarin. The dose-response interaction of warfarin is associated with numerous factors, depending on which an uncommon life-threatening bleeding may occur. The present case study reported on a patient with acute limb ischemia and a history of warfarin-induced bleeding ten years previously and who again developed life threatening bleeding associated with warfarin treatment and received vascular surgery. In this patient, a cytochrome P450 3A4 loss-of-function mutation decreased the effective dose of warfarin. Although this was a rare case, clinicians should be alert to the bleeding risk associated with such rare genetic mutations.", "Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) is effective in managing patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) caused by large-vessel occlusions and allows for valuable histological analysis of thrombi. However, whether bridging therapy (pretreatment with intravenous thrombolysis before MT) provides additional benefits in patients with middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion remains unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the effects of direct MT and bridging therapy, and to elucidate the correlation between thrombus composition and stroke subtypes. Seventy-three patients with acute ischemic stroke who received MT, were eligible for intravenous thrombolysis, and had MCA occlusion were included. We matched 21 direct MT patients with 21 bridging therapy patients using propensity score matching and compared their 3rd-month clinical outcomes. All MCA thrombi (n = 45) were histologically analyzed, and the red blood cell (RBC) and fibrin percentages were quantified. We compared the clot composition according to stroke etiology (large-artery atherosclerosis and cardioembolism) and intravenous thrombolysis application. The baseline characteristics showed no difference between groups except for a higher atrial fibrillation rate and NIHSS score on admission in the direct MT group. We performed a supportive analysis using propensity score matching but could not find any differences in the functional outcome, mortality, and intracerebral hemorrhage. In the histological clot analysis, the cardioembolic clots without intravenous thrombolysis pretreatment had higher RBC (P = 0.042) and lower fibrin (P = 0.042) percentages than the large-artery atherosclerosis thrombi. Similar findings were observed in the thrombi treated with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (P = 0.012). In conclusion, there was no difference in the functional outcomes between the direct MT and bridging therapy groups. However, randomized trials are needed to elucidate the high ratio of cardioembolism subtype in our group of patients. The histological MCA thrombus composition differed between cardioembolism and large-artery atherosclerosis, and this finding provides valuable information on the underlying pathogenesis and thrombus origin.", " Mesh implantation during abdominal wall reconstruction decreases rates of ventral hernia recurrence and has become the dominant method of repair. The authors provide a comprehensive comparison of surgical outcomes and complications by location of mesh placement following ventral hernia repair with onlay, interposition, retrorectus, or underlay mesh. METHODS A systematic search of the English literature published from 1996 to 2012 in the PubMed, MEDLINE, and Cochrane library databases was conducted to identify patients who underwent abdominal wall reconstruction using either prosthetic or biological mesh for ventral hernia repair. Demographic information was obtained from each study. RESULTS Sixty-two relevant articles were included with 5824 patients treated with mesh repair of a ventral hernia between 1996 and 2012. Mesh position included onlay (19.6 percent), underlay (60.7 percent), interposition (6.4 percent), and retrorectus (12.4 percent). Prosthetic mesh was used in 80 percent of repairs and biological mesh in 20 percent. The weighted mean incidences of early events were as follows: wound complications, 19 percent; wound infections, 8 percent; seroma or hematoma formation, 11 percent; and reoperation, 10 percent. The weighted mean incidences of late complications included 8 percent for hernia recurrence and 2 percent for mesh explantation. Recurrence rates were highest for onlay (17 percent) or interposition (17 percent) reinforcement. The infection rate was also highest in the interposition cohort (25 percent). Seroma rates were lowest following a retrorectus repair (4 percent). CONCLUSIONS Mesh reinforcement of a ventral hernia repair is safe and efficacious, but the location of the reinforcement appears to influence outcomes. Underlay or retrorectus mesh placement is associated with lower recurrence rates.", "By collecting photons scattered out of the therapy beam, scatter imaging creates images of the treated volume. Two phantoms were used to assess the possible application of scatter imaging for markerless tracking of lung tumors during stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) treatment. A scatter-imaging camera was assembled with a CsI flat-panel detector and a 5 mm diameter pinhole collimator. Scatter images were collected during the irradiation of phantoms with megavoltage photons. To assess scatter image quality, spherical phantom lung tumors of 2.1 - 2.8 cm diameters were placed inside a static, anthropomorphic phantom. To show the efficacy of the technique with a moving target (3 cm diameter), the position of a simulated tumor was tracked in scatter images during sinusoidal motion (15 mm amplitude, 0.25 Hz frequency) in a dynamic lung phantom in open-field, dynamic conformal arc (DCA), and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) deliveries. Anatomical features are identifiable on static phantom scatter images collected with 10 MU of delivered dose (2.1 cm diameter lung tumor contrast-to-noise ratio of 4.4). The contrast-to-noise ratio increases with tumor size and delivered dose. During dynamic motion, the position of the 3.0 cm diameter lung tumor was identified with a root-mean-square error of 0.8, 1.2, and 2.9 mm for open field (0.3 s frame integration), DCA (0.5 s), and VMAT (0.5 s), respectively. Based on phantom studies, scatter imaging is a potential technique for markerless lung tumor tracking during SBRT without additional imaging dose. Quality scatter images may be collected at low, clinically relevant doses (10 MU). Scatter images are capable of sub-millimeter tracking precision, but modulation decreases accuracy.", "The aim of this study is to investigate the blood perfusion and the inflammatory response of the myocardial infarct area after transplanting a hyaluronan-based scaffold (HYAFF(\u00ae) 11) with bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Nine-week-old female pigs were subjected to a permanent left anterior descending coronary artery ligation for 4 weeks. According to the kind of the graft, the swine subjected to myocardial infarction were divided into the HYAFF(\u00ae) 11, MSCs, HYAFF(\u00ae) 11/MSCs and untreated groups. The animals were killed 8 weeks after coronary ligation. Scar perfusion, evaluated by Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound echography, was doubled in the HYAFF(\u00ae) 11/MSCs group and was comparable with the perfusion of the healthy, non-infarcted hearts. The inflammation score of the MSCs and HYAFF(\u00ae) 11/MSCs groups was near null, revealing the role of the grafted MSCs in attenuating the cell infiltration, but not the foreign reaction strictly localized around the fibres of the scaffold. Apart from the inflammatory response, the native tissue positively interacted with the HYAFF(\u00ae) 11/MSCs construct modifying the extracellular matrix with a reduced presence of collagene and increased amount of proteoglycans. The border-zone cardiomyocytes also reacted favourably to the graft as a lower degree of cellular damage was found. This study demonstrates that the transplantation in the myocardial infarct area of autologous MSCs supported by a hyaluronan-based scaffold restores blood perfusion and almost completely abolishes the inflammatory process following an infarction. These beneficial effects are superior to those obtained after grafting only the scaffold or MSCs, suggesting that a synergic action was achieved using the cell-integrated polymer construct.", " Pleuroscopy is considered a safe procedure with a high diagnostic accuracy but this record is based on studies published by pulmonologists experienced in performing the procedure. METHODS Review of 40 consecutive patients who underwent semirigid pleuroscopy by a pulmonary fellow under the supervision of a pulmonologist. RESULTS Pleuroscopy was performed for diagnosis of pleural effusion (n=33), or treatment of pleural effusion (n=4) or pneumothorax (n=3). The mean age\u00b1SD of the patients was 58.23\u00b112.98 years and 23 patients were male. Pleuroscopy was performed with a flex-rigid pleuroscope under local anesthesia and conscious sedation. An ultrasound was used to choose the entry site. The dose of midazolam and fentanyl used was 6.45\u00b12.87 mg and 173.39\u00b177.17 mcg, respectively. The duration of the procedure was 69.3\u00b125.3 minutes. The amount of pleural fluid removed was 1.5\u00b10.94 L. The overall diagnostic accuracy of pleuroscopy was 87.8%, and the sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive value for malignancy was 93.9%, 100%, 92.3% and 100%, respectively. There were a few complications: desaturation (n=2), hypotension (n=5), extensive subcutaneous emphysema (n=3), and persistent air leak (n=1). There was no case of significant bleeding or death from the procedure. Six of the 7 cardiopulmonary complications occurred during the first 4 procedures performed by the fellows. CONCLUSIONS The diagnostic accuracy of pleuroscopy remains high in the hands of pulmonary fellows. However, the procedure can be associated with a slightly higher rate of complications when performed by fellows in training, especially in the early part of their learning curve. Most of the few complications observed were not caused by the procedure per se and resulted from over-zealous use of medications for conscious sedation.", "Different surgical techniques exist for the treatment of Zenker's diverticulum (ZD), of which minimally invasive techniques have become the standard. We reviewed our experience with management and treatment of ZD and sought to determine what type of treatment is most effective and efficient. We selected patients who underwent treatment for ZD between January 2004 and January 2014 at our tertiary referral center. All procedures were performed by ENT surgeons. The medical records were reviewed for pre- and intraoperative characteristics and follow-up. Of our 94 patients (58 male, 36 female), 75 underwent endoscopic cricopharyngeal myotomy (42 stapler, 33 laser) and 6 received treatment via transcervical approach. 13 interventions were aborted. Mean operating time was 49.0 min for stapler, 68.3 for laser and 124.0 for the transcervical approach. Its respective median post-operative admission durations were 2.0, 3.0 and 3.0 days. After the first treatment, of the 75 endoscopic procedures, 45 patients (23 stapler, 22 laser) had complete symptom resolution. In the transcervical group 4 (67 %) patients were symptom free and one patient died of complications. In the endoscopically treated patients, ten complications occurred, of which 8 G1 and 2 G2 (Clavien Dindo classification). In the transcervical group 2 complications occurred, 1 G3b and 1 G5. Both endoscopic techniques provide efficient management of Zenker's diverticulum with the stapler-assisted modality providing a shorter surgery duration and hospital admission. Although there is no significant difference in terms of complications or recurrence rates for both endoscopic techniques, it seems that stapler patients are at higher risk of having a re-intervention and of having more severe complications.", " AND AIMS The aim of this study is to analyze a single-center experience in orthotopic liver transplantation with the piggy-back technique (PB) realized with a cuff of three veins without temporary portacaval shunt. Outcome parameters were graft and patient survival and the surgical complications. METHODS The records of 423 liver transplantation in 396 adult recipients were reviewed. PB was performed in all cases also in patients with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts and redo transplants without temporary portacaval shunt. No hemodynamic instability was observed during venous reconstruction. RESULTS Operation time, cold ischemia time and anhepatic phase were, respectively, 316, 606 and 82 min, respectively. The mean intraoperative transfusion of packed red blood cells was 3.2 (range 1-48). Surgical complications were observed in 25% of the orthotopic liver transplantation and 2% of these was related to caval anastomosis. No case of caval thrombosis was observed; a stenosis was noted in seven patients, always treated with an endovascular approach. A postoperative ascites was observed in seven cases. Retransplantation was required in 6.3% patients. Overall in-hospital mortality was 5.3%, but no patient died through technical problems or complications related to PB procedure. One-, 3- and 5-year grafts and patients were 94%, 83% and 75%, and 92%, 86% and 79%, respectively. CONCLUSION This experience indicates that our approach is feasible with a low specific risk and can be performed without portacaval shunt, with minimal outflow venous complications.", " Increasing levels of obesity, arising from energy-rich diets and sedentary lifestyles, are driving a global pandemic of type 2 diabetes. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes worldwide is set to increase from its present level of 150 million, to 225 million by the end of the decade and to as many as 300 million by 2025. Shocking as they are, these figures represent only clinically diagnosed diabetes, and many more cases of diabetes remain undiagnosed and untreated. In addition, up to one-quarter of western populations have impaired glucose tolerance or the dysmetabolic syndrome, which are considered to represent pre-diabetic states. Type 2 diabetes is appearing increasingly in children and adolescents, and the frequency of diagnosis of paediatric type 2 diabetes is outstripping that of type 1 diabetes in some areas. The long-term complications associated with type 2 diabetes carries a crushing burden of morbidity and mortality, and most type 2 diabetic patients die prematurely from a cardiovascular event. Diabetic patients are more than twice as costly to manage as non-diabetic patients, due mainly to the high costs associated with management of diabetic complications. Indeed, diabetes care already accounts for about 2-7% of the total national health care budgets of western European countries. Controlling the type 2 diabetes epidemic will require changes to the structure of healthcare delivery. Well-resourced interventions will be required, with effective co-ordination between all levels of government, health care agencies, multidisciplinary health care teams, professional organisations, and patient advocacy groups. Above all, intervention is needed today.", "OBJECTIVES The aim was to determine whether physician modified stent grafts (PMSGs) are safe and effective for the treatment of high risk patients with thoraco-abdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAAs). DESIGN This was a retrospective single institution study. MATERIAL Consecutive patients with TAAA undergoing endovascular repair using a PMSG between January 2012 and June 2014 were evaluated. METHODS Fenestrations to preserve branch vessels were created in TX2 thoracic (Cook Medical) stent grafts. Pre- intra- and post-operative data were recorded by means of a prospectively maintained database. RESULTS Eleven high risk patients with TAAA (type I, n = 4; type III, n = 3; type IV, n = 3; type V, n = 1) underwent fenestrated endovascular repair using PMSGs. Indications were painful aneurysm (n = 5), >70 mm rapidly enlarging aneurysm (n = 4), saccular aneurysm (n = 1), and visceral patch false aneurysm after open repair of a type IV TAAA (n = 1). In four asymptomatic patients, an additional fenestration was created for temporary selective sac perfusion and occluded 2-4 weeks later. Median duration for stent graft modifications was 2 hours (range 1-3 hours). The median number of fenestrations was three (range 2-4). One patient died during the post-operative period from colonic ischemia, giving a 9% in hospital mortality rate. Four (36%) patients presented with moderate to severe complications. One (9%) patient presented with a paraparesis that resolved completely after spinal fluid drainage. Among surviving patients, four required early endovascular re-intervention for type III endoleak (n = 2), type Ia endoleak (n = 1), or target vessel cannulation failure (n = 1). The median follow up time was 6 months (range 3-20 months). During follow up, no other complications occurred and all target vessels remained patent. One patient presented with a persistent type II endoleak. CONCLUSION PMSGs provided acceptable short-term results and may be a management option for the treatment of TAAA in selected high risk patients. Durability concerns need to be assessed in additional studies with long-term follow up.", " AND OBJECTIVE Few prospective studies exist evaluating the safety and efficacy of the Pipeline Embolization Device (PED) in the treatment of intracranial aneurysms. The Aneurysm Study of Pipeline In an observational Registry (ASPIRe) study prospectively analyzed rates of complete aneurysm occlusion and neurologic adverse events following PED treatment of intracranial aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed a multicenter study prospectively evaluating patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms treated with PED. Primary outcomes included (1) spontaneous rupture of the Pipeline-treated aneurysm; (2) spontaneous nonaneurysmal intracranial hemorrhage (ICH); (3) acute ischemic stroke; (4) parent artery stenosis, and (5) permanent cranial neuropathy. Secondary endpoints were (1) treatment success and (2) morbidity and mortality at the 6-month follow-up. Vascular imaging was evaluated at an independent core laboratory. RESULTS One hundred and ninety-one patients with 207 treated aneurysms were included in this registry. The mean aneurysm size was 14.5 \u00b1 6.9 mm, and the median imaging follow-up was 7.8 months. Twenty-four aneurysms (11.6%) were small, 162 (78.3%) were large and 21 (10.1%) were giant. The median clinical follow-up time was 6.2 months. The neurological morbidity rate was 6.8% (13/191), and the neurological mortality rate was 1.6% (3/191). The combined neurological morbidity/mortality rate was 6.8% (13/191). The most common adverse events were ischemic stroke (4.7%, 9/191) and spontaneous ICH (3.7%, 7/191). The complete occlusion rate at the last follow-up was 74.8% (77/103). CONCLUSIONS Our prospective postmarket study confirms that PED treatment of aneurysms in a heterogeneous patient population is safe with low rates of neurological morbidity and mortality. Patients with angiographic follow-up had complete occlusion rates of 75% at 8 months.", " Patients with coronary stents often undergo non-cardiac invasive procedures. These are often associated with thrombotic and/or hemorrhagic complications. The type of procedure, perioperative antiplatelet therapy, and other patient-related factors influence the risk of postoperative haemorrhage. Our objective was to analyze the postoperative risk factors for hemorrhagic complications and to determine the impact of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy strategies on postoperative bleeding risk in patients with coronary stents undergoing non-cardiac surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS Prospective, multicentre observational cohort study of 1134 consecutive patients with coronary stents undergoing non-cardiac surgery between April 2007 and April 2009. The primary outcome measure was the occurrence of an hemorrhagic complication during the first 30days following the surgery or intervention. RESULTS Among the 1134 patients evaluated, 108 (9.5%) experienced a postoperative hemorrhagic complication (with a median time to occurrence of 5.3days). These complications were considered major, involved the operative site, and required reoperation in 92 (85.2%), 92 (85.2%), and 20 (18.5%) of patients, respectively. Mortality in patients with a haemorrhagic complication was 12% (n=13). Independent postoperative factors associated with haemorrhagic complications were identified as a high and intermediate bleeding risk procedure and the use and dose of anticoagulants. When interrupted before the procedure, resumption of antiplatelet treatment was delayed in patients developing early postoperative hemorrhagic complications. CONCLUSION Patients with coronary stents who undergo surgery are at high risk for hemorrhagic complications.", " Experience with endovascular therapy of extracranial carotid artery pseudoaneurysm (ECAP) has been growing, and various results suggest it as a suitable treatment option. We present a consecutive case series of patients with ECAPs treated with endovascular therapy, and a pertinent literature review. METHODS A prospectively maintained database of neuroendovascular procedures was retrospectively reviewed for cases of ECAP treated between January 2007 and December 2012. The primary outcome of interest was incidence of periprocedural (within 30 days) neurologic and cardiopulmonary complications. PubMed was searched for relevant endovascular studies from 2000 to 2012 for the review. RESULTS In our series, 12 patients with 14 ECAPs received stents, with or without coils. No perioperative neurologic or cardiopulmonary complications occurred. Median duration of clinical follow-up was 6.25 months (range 0-50 months), and median duration of imaging follow-up was 6.25 months (range 0-50 months), with eight patients asymptomatic and three showing improved symptoms (one patient with two lesions was lost to follow-up). Literature review revealed an overall primary outcome of 8.6% and no procedure related deaths. CONCLUSIONS Endovascular treatment of ECAP is safe and effective at improving symptoms. There were no perioperative or permanent neurologic sequelae in the 11 patients with follow-up, and all symptomatology related to ECAP improved or resolved with treatment.", "Recently, human infections caused by severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV), which can lead to fatality, have dramatically increased in East Asia. With the unavailability of vaccines or antiviral drugs to prevent and/or treat SFTSV infection, early rapid diagnosis is critical for prevention and control of the disease. Here, we report the development of a simple, rapid and sensitive portable detection method for SFTSV infection applying reverse transcription-loop mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) combined with one-pot colorimetric visualization and electro-free reaction platform. This method utilizes a pocket warmer to facilitate diagnosis in a resource-limited setting. Specific primers were designed to target the highly-conserved region of L gene of SFTSV. The detection limit of the RT-LAMP assay was approximately 100 viral genome copies from three different SFTSV strains. This assay exhibited comparable sensitivity to qRT-PCR and 10-fold more sensitivity than conventional RT-PCR, with a rapid detection time of 30 to 60 minutes. The RT-LAMP assay using SFTSV clinical specimens has demonstrated a similar detection rate to qRT-PCR and a higher detection rate compared to conventional RT-PCR. Moreover, there was no observed cross-reactive amplification of other human infectious viruses including Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV), Dengue, Enterovirus, Zika, Influenza and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). This highly sensitive, electro- and equipment-free rapid colorimetric visualization method is feasible for resource-limited SFTSV field diagnosis.", "Neurologists are used to uncertainty - diagnoses are frequently challenging, too often there are limited treatment options, and unpredictable prognoses are our bread and butter. When colleagues struggle to communicate bad news, they regularly turn to us. We practice staying steady and calm amidst our patients' fears, confusion, suffering, and anxiety. We listen, perform detailed exams, and do our best to provide helpful insights. This emphasis on listening and thoughtful problem solving is the core of our art and should be front and center as we partner with colleagues to face an unprecedented set of challenges related to the Covid-19 pandemic.", "The in vivo effect of 11-ketotestosterone (11KT) on transcript levels of the gonadotropin receptors (fshr and lhr) and sex differentiation-related genes (dmrt1 and foxl2) was examined in ovaries of immature female beluga. For this purpose, six fish were treated with implants containing 2.5 mg 11KT and a placebo group of six females of the same age and gametogenic stage were given a blank implant. The implants were intraperitoneally inserted into 4-year-old females at the previtellogenic stage (mean body weight 5580 \u00b1 165 g) and maintained under culture conditions for 8 weeks. Ovary samples for gene expression analysis of lhr, fshr, dmrt1 and foxl2 were collected by biopsy at 3 and 8 weeks post-implantation. Diameters of oocytes increased in response to 11KT treatment, both at 3 and at 8 weeks post-implantation, but no obvious changes were evident in cytology. Three weeks of 11KT treatment did not affect target gene expression, but a tendency for a time-dependent decrease of lhr and dmrt1 mRNA levels was observed in both treatment and placebo groups. By 8 weeks of treatment, however, 11KT implants provoked the upregulation of fshr and foxl2 transcript levels. Furthermore, lhr and dmrt1 transcript abundances recovered by 8 weeks of exposure in both blank- and 11KT-implanted beluga. These results suggest that 11KT, either directly or indirectly, may affect gametogenesis and regulate some key components of the reproductive axis in female beluga.

Selective cerebral hypothermia applied early, prior to and during endovascular mechanical recanalization therapy, may be beneficial in the critical phase of reperfusion. We aimed to assess the feasibility of a new intracarotid cooling catheter in an animal model. MATERIALS AND METHODS Nine adult sheep were included. Temperature probes were introduced into the frontal and temporal brain cortices bilaterally. The cooling catheter system was introduced into a common carotid artery. Selective blood cooling was applied for 180 minutes. Systemic and local brain temperatures were measured during cooling and rewarming. Common carotid artery diameters and flow were measured angiographically and by Doppler sonography. RESULTS The common carotid artery diameter was between 6.7 and 7.3 mm. Common carotid artery blood flow velocities increased moderately during cooling and after catheter removal. Maximum cerebral cooling in the ipsilateral temporal cortex was -4.7\u00b0C (95% CI, -5.1 to -4.0\u00b0C). Ipsilateral brain temperatures dropped significantly faster and became lower compared with the contralateral cortex with maximum temperature difference of -1.3\u00b0C (95% CI, -1.5 to -1.0\u00b0C; P < .0001) and compared with systemic temperature (-1.4\u00b0C; 95% CI, -1.7 to -1.0\u00b0C; P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS Sheep proved a feasible animal model for the intracarotid cooling catheter. Fast induction of selective mild hypothermia was achieved within the cooled cerebral hemisphere, with stable temperature gradients in the contralateral brain and systemic blood. Further studies are required to demonstrate any therapeutic benefit of selective cerebral cooling in a stroke model.", "PURPOSE To describe the use of Embozene microspheres as an alternative treatment for intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVF). CASE REPORT The DAVF was located close to the vertex and mainly fed by the left medial meningeal artery (MMA). Embolization was performed using Embozene microspheres due to stenosis in the posterior branch of the left MMA and a conglomerate of tortuous courses in the anterior branch. Complete occlusion was achieved without complication. Neurological symptoms improved, and the patient remained asymptomatic during 1-year follow-up. Angiography at 1 year did not reveal any revascularization. CONCLUSION Use of microspheres may be a safe and effective alternative treatment, particularly in patients with impeded access to the DAVF.", ". Background: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan City, China spreads rapidly since December, 2019. Most patients show mild symptoms, but some of them develop into severe disease. There is currently no specific medication. The purpose of this study is to to explore changes of markers in peripheral blood of severe COVID-19 patients, which may be of value in disease monitoring. Methods Clinical data of patients with nonsevere and severe type COVID-19 diagnosed by laboratory test in our institution were collected. The relationship between peripheral blood cells and cytokines, clinical manifestation and outcome was analyzed. Results A total of 69 severe type COVID-19 patients were included. On admission, the median age of severe cases was 56-year old, with 52.17% female patient. The most common symptoms were fever (79.72%), cough (63.77%), shortness of breath (57.97%) and fatigue (50.72%). Diarrhea is less common. The most common comorbidity is hypertension. Upon admission, the proportion of bilateral pulmonary involvement and interstitial abnormalities evidenced by chest computed tomography (CT) imaging in severe cases was 60.87% and 27.54%, respectively. Compared with patients with nonsevere disease, those with severe disease showed obvious lymphocytopenia. Elevated level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin and D-dimer was found in most cases. Two patients (2.9%) needed transfer to the intensive care unit. Baseline immunological parameters and most of the inflammatory parameters were basically within the normal range. However, baseline interleukin-6 (IL-6) was significantly increased in severe type, which was closely related to the maximal body temperature during hospitalization and to CT findings. Baseline IL-6 was also significantly related to the increase of baseline level of CRP, LDH, ferritin and D-dimer. The increase of baseline IL-6 level suggests that it may positively correlate with the severity of COVID-19. Among the 30 severe type patients whose IL-6 was assessed before and after treatment, significant decrease in IL-6 and improved CT assessment was found in 25 patients after treatment. Whereas the IL-6 level was further increased in 3 cases, which was closely related to disease progression. It is suggested that IL-6 may be used as a marker for disease monitoring in severe COVID-19 patients. Conclusions On admission, the baseline level of IL-6, CRP, LDH and ferritin was closely related to the severity of COVID-19, and the elevated IL-6 was significantly related to the clinical manifestation of severe type patients. The decrease of IL-6 was closely related to treatment effectiveness, while the increase of IL-6 indicated disease exacerbation. Collectively, the dynamic change of IL-6 level can be used as a marker for disease monitoring in patients with severe COVID-19.", "In recent decades, endovascular aneurysm repair or endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) has become an acceptable alternative to open surgery for the treatment of thoracic and abdominal aortic aneurysms and other aortic pathologies such as the acute aortic syndromes (e.g., penetrating aortic ulcer, intramural hematoma, dissection). Available data suggest that endovascular repair is associated with lower perioperative 30-day all-cause mortality as well as a significant reduction in perioperative morbidity when compared to open surgery. Additionally, EVAR leads to decreased blood loss, eliminates the need for cross-clamping the aorta and has shorter recovery periods than traditional surgery. It is currently the preferred mode of treatment of thoracic and abdominal aortic aneurysms in a subset of patients who meet certain anatomic criteria conducive to endovascular repair. The main disadvantage of EVAR procedures is the high rate of post-procedural complications that often require secondary re-intervention. As a result, most authorities recommend lifelong imaging surveillance following repair. Available surveillance modalities include conventional radiography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance angiography, ultrasonography, nuclear imaging and conventional angiography, with computed tomography currently considered to be the gold standard for surveillance by most experts. Following endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair, the rate of complications is estimated to range between 16% and 30%. The complication rate is higher following thoracic EVAR (TEVAR) and is estimated to be as high as 38%. Common complications include both those related to the endograft device and systemic complications. Device-related complications include endoleaks, endograft migration or collapse, kinking and/or stenosis of an endograft limb and graft infection. Post-procedural systemic complications include end-organ ischemia, cerebrovascular and cardiovascular events and post-implantation syndrome. Secondary re-interventions are required in approximately 19% to 24% of cases following endovascular abdominal and thoracic aortic aneurysm repair respectively. Typically, most secondary reinterventions involve the use of percutaneous techniques such as placement of cuff extension devices, additional endograft components or stents, enhancement of endograft fixation, treatment of certain endoleaks using various embolization techniques and embolic agents and thrombolysis of occluded endograft components. Less commonly, surgical conversion and/or open surgical modification are required. In this article, we provide an overview of the most common complications that may occur following endovascular repair of thoracic and AAAs. We also summarize the current surveillance recommendations for detecting and evaluating these complications and discuss various current secondary re-intervention approaches that may typically be employed for treatment.", "OBJECTIVE The purpose of this investigation was two-fold: first, we examined associations between suicidal ideation, maladaptive sleep patterns and abnormal sleep behaviors in a sleep center population, an understudied population in the domain of suicide research; and then, we explored whether significant associations remained after accounting for the possible influence of depressive symptoms. METHOD Data were analyzed from intake information obtained from 1584 adult patients presenting at a community-based private sleep medical center. The sample was parsed into a Suicidal Ideation (SI) group (N=211) and No Suicidal Ideation (NSI) group (N=1373). Comparisons of these groups were made on measures of self-reported sleep complaints, habits, and behaviors, suicidal ideation, depressive symptoms, and associated psychopathology. RESULTS Approximately 13% of participants reported suicidal ideation. Clinically significant suicidal ideation was present in 4.5% of the sample. Compared to the NSI group, the SI group showed a pervasive pattern of significantly greater frequency or severity of sleep problems in areas of insomnia, nightmares and other parasomnia behaviors, poor sleep quality, and sleep-related psychophysiologic conditioning as well as worse sleep-related impairment and quality of life. Several relationships were significant after controlling for depressive symptoms. DISCUSSION Suicidal ideation was consistently associated with a broad array of sleep complaints, even when controlling for level of depressive symptoms. As these self-reported sleep disturbances are treatable sleep disorders, future research should examine the efficacy of sleep and behavioral medicine for reducing the risk of suicidal ideation.", " In embolizing a cerebral aneurysm, achievement of a high-volume embolization ratio (VER: volume of inserted coils / aneurysm volume) is important because it may prevent coil compaction and recanalization. The goal of the study is to examine whether use of softer and longer coils gives an adequate VER with fewer coils, particularly for small aneurysms. METHODS Aneurysm volumes, VERs, and numbers of inserted coils were investigated in 23 cases of small aneurysms embolized using Infini coils, a long soft coil with a primary diameter of 0.010 inches (Infini group). An aneurysm volume- and VER-matched control (non-Infini) group of 59 cases was selected from patients treated at our facility. Data were also compared between subgroups of patients (n = 18 and n = 34 in the Infini and non-Infini groups, respectively) who were not treated with thicker coils with primary diameters of 0.0135-0.015 inches (18-type coils), since these coils affect the number of coils by increasing VER rapidly. RESULTS Average aneurysm volumes and VERs did not differ significantly between the Infini and non-Infini groups. Significantly fewer coils were used per 0.1 ml aneurysm volume in the Infini group (4.08 coils in average) compared with the non-Infini group (5.67) (p < 0.001). In the non-18-type subgroups, the number of coils used remained significantly smaller in the Infini group (4.49) compared with the non-Infini group (6.72), (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION To achieve VER \u226520%, use of Infini coils significantly decreased the number of coils required per unit volume of a small aneurysm.", " Selection of the PEEP associated with the best compliance of the respiratory system during decremental PEEP titration can be used for the treatment of patients suffering from ARDS. We describe changes in transpulmonary pressure (Ptp) and gas exchange during a decremental PEEP titration maneuver in subjects with pulmonary ARDS. METHODS Eleven subjects with early ARDS were included. After a recruitment maneuver they were ventilated in volume-controlled ventilation and PEEP was decreased from 30 to 0 cm H2O by steps of 3 cm H2O. Static airway pressure (Paw), esophageal pressure (Pes), Ptp (Paw - Pes), the ratio of dead space to tidal volume (VD/VT), and PaO2 were recorded at each step. RESULTS A linear correlation was found between Paw and Ptp. Expiratory Ptp became negative in all subjects when PEEP decreased below 8.9 \u00b1 5.2 cm H2O. VD/VT was 0.67 \u00b1 0.06 with 30 cm H2O of PEEP, and decreased 15.4 \u00b1 8.5% during the maneuver, when PEEP and expiratory Ptp were 10.6 \u00b1 4.1 cm H2O and 1.2 \u00b1 2.8 cm H2O, respectively. VD/VT was significantly higher during ventilation at high (> 18 cm H2O), compared to low, inspiratory Ptp values (P < .001). PaO2 decreased when expiratory Ptp became negative (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS During decremental PEEP titration we sequentially observed high inspiratory Ptp that stressed lung tissue and increased VD/VT, and negative Ptp, indicating high risk of alveolar collapse, explaining worse oxygenation. PEEP selection based on Ptp and VD/VT in ARDS may help to avoid these situations.", " AND PURPOSE The p64 is a flow modulation device designed to be used in endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms. There is limited data on the long-term effectiveness of the device. This study sought to determine the safety and long-term efficacy of this device. METHODS A retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database was performed to identify all patients treated with a p64 between March 2015 and November 2018 at University Hospital St. Ivan Rilski. Anatomical features, intraprocedural complications, clinical, and angiographic outcomes were also taken into account and reviewed. RESULTS A total of 72 patients with 72 aneurysms who met the inclusion criteria were identified. Device placement was successful in all patients. Follow-up angiographic imaging at 6 months showed complete occlusion (O'Kelly-Marotta scale [OKM] D) in 55 (76.3%) patients, subtotal aneurysmal filling (OKM B) in 10 (13.8%) patients, and neck remnant (OKM C) in 7 (9.7%) patients. Catheter angiography at 12 months was available for 70 patients (97.2%) and of these patients 91.4% of the aneurysms were completely occluded (OKM D) (64/72). Delayed angiography at 24 months was available for 68 patients (94.4%) and of these 98.5% (67/68) had completely occluded aneurysms. A 36-month angiography was available for 61 patients (84.4%) by which point all aneurysms had been completely occluded (100%). Permanent morbidity due to delayed aneurysmal rupture occurred in one patient (1.38%). The mortality rate was 0%. Self-limiting mild intimal hyperplasia was seen in 2 patients (2.72%). CONCLUSION Treatment of intracranial aneurysms with a p64 flow modulation device is safe and effective with a high success rate and only infrequent complications.", "STUDY OBJECTIVE To compare robotic-assisted laparoscopy with conventional laparoscopy for treatment of advanced stage endometriosis insofar as operative time, estimated blood loss, complication rate, and length of hospital stay. STUDY DESIGN Retrospective cohort study (Canadian Task Force classification II2). All procedures were performed by one surgeon between January 2004 and July 2012. Data was collected via chart review. SETTING Tertiary referral center for treatment of endometriosis. PATIENTS Four hundred twenty women with advanced endometriosis. INTERVENTIONS Fertility-sparing surgery to treat advanced endometriosis, either via conventional or robotic-assisted laparoscopy. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Patient demographic data, operative time, estimated blood loss, complication rate, and length of hospital stay were compared between the 2 groups. Two hundred seventy-three patients underwent conventional laparoscopy and 147 patients underwent robotic-assisted laparoscopy for fertility-sparing treatment of advanced stage endometriosis. Patients in both groups had similar characteristics insofar as age, body mass index, and previous abdominal surgeries. There were no significant differences in blood loss or complication rate between the 2 groups. Mean operative time in the conventional laparoscopy group was 135 minutes (range, 115-156 minutes), and in the robotic-assisted laparoscopy group was 196 minutes (range, 185-209 minutes), with a mean difference in operative time of 61 minutes (p < .001). Length of hospital stay was also significantly increased in the robotic-assisted laparoscopy group. Most patients who underwent conventional laparoscopy were discharged to home on the day of surgery. Of 273 patients in the conventional laparoscopy group, only 63 remained in the hospital overnight, and all 147 patients in the robotic-assisted laparoscopy group were discharged on postoperative day 1. CONCLUSION Conventional laparoscopy and robotic-assisted laparoscopy are excellent methods for treatment of advanced stages of endometriosis. However, use of the robotic platform may increase operative time and might also be associated with longer hospital stay.", "Flow diversion has revolutionised the treatment of intracranial aneurysms, and the Pipeline Embolization Device (PED) remains the only flow diverter (FD) approved in the USA. However, thromboembolic events remain an issue for FDs. Attempting to minimise these incidents, a newer PED has been developed with the use of covalent bonding of phosphorylcholine onto the Pipeline device that has been known as Shield Technology (PED Shield), which in vitro has demonstrated a significant reduction in material thrombogenicity. We report the first US experience of the PED Shield in the treatment of a ruptured fusiform aneurysm located in the right vertebral artery in an attempt to mitigate complications related to the use of dual-antiplatelet therapy and discuss our rationale for using the new FD, using aspirin only as the antiplatelet regimen.", " Metformin, a widely used hypoglycemic drug, reduces stroke incidence and alleviates chronic inflammation in clinical trials. However, the effect of metformin in ischemic stroke is unclear. Here, we investigated the effect of metformin on ischemic stroke in mice and further explored the possible underlying mechanisms. METHODS Ninety-eight adult male CD-1 mice underwent 90-minute transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). Metformin (200 mg/kg) was administrated for up to 14 days. Neurobehavioral outcomes, brain infarct volume, inflammatory factors, blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and AMPK signaling pathways were evaluated following tMCAO. Oxygen glucose deprivation was performed on bEND.3 cells to explore the mechanisms of metformin in inhibiting inflammatory signaling pathways. RESULTS Infarct volume was reduced in metformin-treated mice compared to the control group following tMCAO (P < 0.05). Neurobehavioral outcomes were greatly improved in metformin-treated mice (P < 0.05). MPO+ cells, Gr1+ cells, MPO activity and BBB permeability were decreased after metformin administration (P < 0.05). In addition, metformin activated AMPK phosphorylation, inhibited NF-\u03baB activation, down-regulated cytokine (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1) and ICAM-1 expression following tMCAO (P < 0.05). Furthermore, metformin activated AMPK signaling pathway and alleviated oxygen-glucose deprivation-induced ICAM-1 expression in bEND.3 cells (P < 0.05). Compound C, a selective AMPK inhibitor, eliminated this promotional effect. CONCLUSIONS Metformin down-regulated ICAM-1 in an AMPK-dependent manner, which could effectively prevent ischemia-induced brain injury by alleviating neutrophil infiltration, suggesting that metformin is a promising therapeutic agent in stroke therapy.", " Venous thromboembolism is a common, potentially avoidable cause of death and morbidity in patients in hospital, including those with stroke. In surgical patients, intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) reduces the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), but no reliable evidence exists about its effectiveness in patients who have had a stroke. We assessed the effectiveness of IPC to reduce the risk of DVT in patients who have had a stroke. METHODS The CLOTS 3 trial is a multicentre parallel group randomised trial assessing IPC in immobile patients (ie, who cannot walk to the toilet without the help of another person) with acute stroke. We enrolled patients from day 0 to day 3 of admission and allocated them via a central randomisation system (ratio 1:1) to receive either IPC or no IPC. A technician who was masked to treatment allocation did a compression duplex ultrasound (CDU) of both legs at 7-10 days and, wherever practical, at 25-30 days after enrolment. Caregivers and patients were not masked to treatment assignment. Patients were followed up for 6 months to determine survival and later symptomatic venous thromboembolism. The primary outcome was a DVT in the proximal veins detected on a screening CDU or any symptomatic DVT in the proximal veins, confirmed on imaging, within 30 days of randomisation. Patients were analysed according to their treatment allocation. TRIAL REGISTRATION ISRCTN93529999. FINDINGS Between Dec 8, 2008, and Sept 6, 2012, 2876 patients were enrolled in 94 centres in the UK. The included patients were broadly representative of immobile stroke patients admitted to hospital and had a median age of 76 years (IQR 67-84). The primary outcome occurred in 122 (8\u00b75%) of 1438 patients allocated IPC and 174 (12\u00b71%) of 1438 patients allocated no IPC; an absolute reduction in risk of 3\u00b76% (95% CI 1\u00b74-5\u00b78). Excluding the 323 patients who died before any primary outcome and 41 without any screening CDU, the adjusted OR for the comparison of 122 of 1267 patients vs 174 of 1245 patients was 0\u00b765 (95% CI 0\u00b751-0\u00b784; p=0\u00b7001). Deaths in the treatment period occurred in 156 (11%) patients allocated IPC and 189 (13%) patients allocated no IPC died within the 30 days of treatment period (p=0\u00b7057); skin breaks on the legs were reported in 44 (3%) patients allocated IPC and in 20 (1%) patients allocated no IPC (p=0\u00b7002); falls with injury were reported in 33 (2%) patients in the IPC group and in 24 (2%) patients in the no-IPC group (p=0\u00b7221). INTERPRETATION IPC is an effective method of reducing the risk of DVT and possibly improving survival in a wide variety of patients who are immobile after stroke. FUNDING National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) programme, UK; Chief Scientist Office of Scottish Government; Covidien (MA, USA).", "The genome sequence of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-associated virus provides essential information for the identification of pathogen(s), exploration of etiology and evolution, interpretation of transmission and pathogenesis, development of diagnostics, prevention by future vaccination, and treatment by developing new drugs. We report the complete genome sequence and comparative analysis of an isolate (BJ01) of the coronavirus that has been recognized as a pathogen for SARS. The genome is 29725 nt in size and has 11 ORFs (Open Reading Frames). It is composed of a stable region encoding an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (composed of 2 ORFs) and a variable region representing 4 CDSs (coding sequences) for viral structural genes (the S, E, M, N proteins) and 5 PUPs (putative uncharacterized proteins). Its gene order is identical to that of other known coronaviruses. The sequence alignment with all known RNA viruses places this virus as a member in the family of Coronaviridae. Thirty putative substitutions have been identified by comparative analysis of the 5 SARS-associated virus genome sequences in GenBank. Fifteen of them lead to possible amino acid changes (non-synonymous mutations) in the proteins. Three amino acid changes, with predicted alteration of physical and chemical features, have been detected in the S protein that is postulated to be involved in the immunoreactions between the virus and its host. Two amino acid changes have been detected in the M protein, which could be related to viral envelope formation. Phylogenetic analysis suggests the possibility of non-human origin of the SARS-associated viruses but provides no evidence that they are man-made. Further efforts should focus on identifying the etiology of the SARS-associated virus and ruling out conclusively the existence of other possible SARS-related pathogen(s).", "Background Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) lobectomy has become the major surgical option for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Endoscopic instruments such as stapler cartridges are essential for VATS procedures. In this study, we investigated the factors that affect the number of stapler cartridges used in VATS lobectomy. Methods A retrospective analysis was conducted of patients who underwent complete VATS lobectomy for NSCLC from January 2013 to December 2015. Results In total, 596 patients underwent complete VATS lobectomy. The average number of stapler cartridges used for VATS lobectomy was 5.3\u00b11.9. The number of stapler cartridges used for VATS lobectomy was higher in men (5.5\u00b11.9 vs. 5.0\u00b118, p=0.006), those aged older than 70 years (5.5\u00b12.1 vs. 5.1\u00b11.7, p=0.038), those who underwent upper or middle lobectomy procedures (5.7\u00b11.9 vs. 4.1\u00b11.2, p<0.001), those with a higher fissure sum average (p<0.001), and those in whom surgery was performed by a surgeon with a preference for staplers (5.6\u00b12.0 vs. 4.9\u00b11.6, p<0.001). Conclusion The number of stapler cartridges required to perform VATS lobectomy in NSCLC patients appears to be influenced by sex, age, the location of the tumor, the degree of fissure development, and the surgeon's preference.", " With advances in endoscopic diagnosis of early-stage gastrointestinal pathology, the need to offer minimally invasive treatment is attracting significant interest. It is essential that secure and consistent closure of full-thickness colonic resections and colotomy access be provided in natural orifice translumenal surgery (NOTES). This ex vivo porcine study aimed to evaluate a novel prototype flexible endoscopic stapler device for use in closure of full-thickness colonic defects. METHODS A feasibility study using ex vivo porcine colon was undertaken to explore the potential of the prototype stapler to close and seal a colotomy. A standardized linear colotomy was created in 30 colons. The novel flexible endostapler was used to close 20, interrupted hand-sewn sutures to close 5, and a well-validated linear stapler to close 5 of these colotomies. The colons were subsequently subjected to leak pressure testing. RESULTS The colotomy closure using the prototype stapler endoluminally required a median time of 280 s. No statistically significant difference in leak pressures between the stapler and the other techniques was described. Although the endostapler without any colotomy was found to have the highest median leak pressures and the interrupted sutures the lowest pressures, no significant difference could be demonstrated (p = 0.52). Furthermore, no significant difference was demonstrated when the closure integrity created by the flexible stapler was compared with that created by the well-validated linear stapler. CONCLUSION The results suggest that the flexible endoscopic stapler is an effective device for the safe closure of a visceral defect, which in this feasibility study was equivalent to other well-established techniques. Further studies will focus on in vivo application of the prototype stapling device in the setting of full-thickness colonic resection.", "OBJECTIVE To compare surgical outcomes of laparoendoscopic single-site myomectomy (LESS-M) vs. conventional laparoscopic myomectomy (LM). DESIGN Multicenter, noninferiority, randomized, controlled trial. SETTING University hospitals. PATIENT(S) A total of 100 subjects with symptomatic uterine myomas were randomly assigned to either LESS-M or conventional LM. Surgical outcomes were comparatively assessed between the groups on the basis of the intention-to-treat principle. INTERVENTION(S) Laparoscopic myomectomy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) The time required for uterine defect suturing. RESULT(S) There were no differences in baseline demographics (age, body mass index, surgical indication, number of myomas, and size and location of the largest myoma) between the two groups. The suturing time (mean \u00b1 SD) was 21.9 \u00b1 10.7 minutes (95% confidence interval 18.8-24.9 min) for the LESS-M group and 23.3 \u00b1 12.4 minutes (95% confidence interval 19.8-26.9 min) for the conventional LM group, with no significant difference between the two groups. The other surgical outcomes, such as total operative time, operative blood loss, postoperative hemoglobin change, degree of surgical difficulty, postoperative pain scores, operative complication, and length of hospital stay, were similar between the two groups. Three subjects (6%) assigned to the LESS-M group underwent conventional LM because of difficulty in myoma enucleation and suturing, whereas no failure to intended procedure occurred in the conventional LM group (6% vs. 0). CONCLUSION(S) Laparoendoscopic single-site surgery is a feasible and safe treatment option for myomectomy that offers surgical outcomes comparable to those with conventional LM. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER NCT01984632.", "OBJECTIVES The Selecting Therapeutic Targets in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (STRIDE) program was initiated by the International Organization for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IOIBD). It examined potential treatment targets for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) to be used for a \"treat-to-target\" clinical management strategy using an evidence-based expert consensus process. METHODS A Steering Committee of 28 IBD specialists developed recommendations based on a systematic literature review and expert opinion. Consensus was gained if \u226575% of participants scored the recommendation as 7-10 on a 10-point rating scale (where 10=agree completely). RESULTS The group agreed upon 12 recommendations for ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). The agreed target for UC was clinical/patient-reported outcome (PRO) remission (defined as resolution of rectal bleeding and diarrhea/altered bowel habit) and endoscopic remission (defined as a Mayo endoscopic subscore of 0-1). Histological remission was considered as an adjunctive goal. Clinical/PRO remission was also agreed upon as a target for CD and defined as resolution of abdominal pain and diarrhea/altered bowel habit; and endoscopic remission, defined as resolution of ulceration at ileocolonoscopy, or resolution of findings of inflammation on cross-sectional imaging in patients who cannot be adequately assessed with ileocolonoscopy. Biomarker remission (normal C-reactive protein (CRP) and calprotectin) was considered as an adjunctive target. CONCLUSIONS Evidence- and consensus-based recommendations for selecting the goals for treat-to-target strategies in patients with IBD are made available. Prospective studies are needed to determine how these targets will change disease course and patients' quality of life.", "We report on an asymptomatic 56-year-old male with incidental diagnosis of celiac trunk aneurysm, diagnosed during an ultrasound scan performed to control polycystic kidney disease. The CT scan revealed a 3.8 cm saccular aneurysm of the celiac artery dissected in the superior wall with a consequent 4.3 cm pseudoaneurysm; we adopted an endovascular approach to exclude the lesion by catheterizing the celiac trunk and positioning a vascular plug in the common hepatic artery and a covered stent in the splenic artery; finally we fulfilled the aneurysm sac with Onyx. 30-day control CT scan revealed procedural success. Five years later he came back to our department for an aneurysm relapse in the common hepatic artery. We performed a second endovascular approach with a superselective catheterization of the pancreaticoduodenal arcade in order to exclude the lesion with Onyx and microcoils. Nowadays the patient is in good clinical conditions. Endovascular approach is a valuable method to treat visceral aneurysms; however, long-term imaging follow-up is essential to monitor the risk of relapse.", "CASE DESCRIPTION 5 dogs (a Newfoundland, Golden Retriever, Shiba Inu, Staffordshire Terrier, and Vizsla) were referred for evaluation and treatment of unilateral aural hematomas within a week after their formation. CLINICAL FINDINGS Aural hematomas involved the left (3) or right (2) ears. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME With patients under anesthesia, the aural hematomas were approached surgically from the convex, or lateral, pinnal surface. Two small incisions were used to position a vacuum drain into the incised hematoma cavity. The drain exited at the base of the pinna and adjacent cervical skin. The free end of the drain was attached to a vacuum reservoir for 18 to 21 days. Drains and skin sutures were removed at this time along with the protective Elizabethan collar. All hematomas resolved and surgical sites healed during the minimum 6-month follow-up period. Cosmetic results were considered excellent in 4 of 5 patients. Slight wrinkling of the pinna in 1 patient resulted from asymmetric enlargement of the cartilaginous walls of the hematoma, where vacuum application resulted in a slight folding of the redundant lateral cartilage wall. CLINICAL RELEVANCE The described treatment was efficient, economical, and minimally invasive and required no bandaging or wound care. Placement of the drain tubing on the convex (lateral) aspect sheltered the system from displacement by patients with an Elizabethan collar in place. Overall cosmetic results were excellent; asymmetric enlargement of the cartilaginous walls of the hematoma with slight folding of the pinna was seen in 1 patient.", "OBJECTIVE Guidelines for referring women with pelvic masses suspicious for ovarian cancer to gynecologic oncologists have been developed by the American College of Obstetrician Gynecologists (ACOG). We set out to evaluate the negative predictive value of these guidelines and to assess a modified algorithm involving minimally invasive surgery in the treatment of women with masses suspected to be benign. METHODS 257 consecutive patients with adnexal masses of 8cm to 13cm on preoperative ultrasound examination meeting Triage Criteria set forth in ACOG Committee Opinion 280. Patients meeting the selection criteria were scheduled for operative laparoscopy, washings, adnexectomy, bagging, and colpotomy. A total of 240 patients successfully completed intended treatment (93.38%), and 234 of these did not require admission (97.5%). There was a low incidence of significant complications: 97.50% of women were successfully treated as outpatients, 97.92% of surgeries lasted <136 minutes, and <97.08% had blood loss <200mL. The negative predictive value of ACOG Committee Opinion 280 Triage Criteria as a deselector for having invasive ovarian malignancy in our population was 95.57% for premenopausal and 90.91% for postmenopausal women. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic adnexectomy, bagging, and colpotomy is a desirable goal for patients with ovarian masses in the 8cm to 13cm range meeting selection criteria affording a minimally invasive approach with attendant benefits including outpatient treatment (97.5%), few complications, low likelihood of iatrogenic rupture of the ovarian capsule (1.25%), and low necessity for reoperation after final pathology is evaluated (6.03%). Negative predictive value of ACOG Committee Opinion 280 is confirmed in a community gynecology practice and is recommended to form the basis of a new treatment algorithm for women with adnexal masses.", "Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly spread around the world resulting in an acute respiratory illness pandemic. The majority of patients presents with mild symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, about 5% become critically ill and require intensive care treatment. Acute hypoxemic failure with severe dyspnea and an increased respiratory rate (>30/min) usually leads to ICU admission. At that point, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates are typically seen. Patients often develop a severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). To date there is no specific treatment available-the main goal of supportive therapy is to ascertain adequate oxygenation. Early intubation and repeated prone positioning are key elements in treating hypoxemic COVID-19 patients. Strict adherence to basic infection control measures (including hand hygiene) and use of personal protection equipment (PPE) are essential in the care of patients. Procedures that lead to formation of aerosols should be avoided where possible and carried out with utmost precaution.", "OBJECTIVES To assess efficacy and morbidity of microwave ablation (MWA) for small renal tumors in an initial cohort of patients. MWA is a recently introduced thermal needle ablation treatment modality with theoretical advantages compared with radiofrequency ablation, such as greater intratumoral temperatures, lack of a grounding pad, and superior convection profile. However, experience has been limited in the human kidney. METHODS Ten patients with a single, solid-enhancing renal tumor from June 2008 to November 2008 received laparoscopic or computed tomography-guided percutaneous MWA at a tertiary referral center with \u226514 months of follow-up. MWA was performed using the Valleylab Evident, 915-MHz MWA system at 45 W with intraoperative biopsy before ablation, and peripheral fiberoptic thermometry to determine the treatment endpoints. The patients were followed up with contrast-enhanced computed tomography at 1 month, 6 months to 1 year, and annually to monitor for tumor recurrence. RESULTS The follow-up duration for the 6 male and 4 female patients (mean tumor size 3.65 cm, range 2.0-5.5; mean age 69.8 years) was 17.9 months. The recurrence rate, defined by persistent enhancement, was 38% (3 of 8). The intraoperative and postoperative complication rate was 20% and 40%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS MWA resulted in poor oncologic outcomes with a significant complication rate at an intermediate level of follow-up. However, MWA has promising theoretical advantages and should not be discarded. Additional studies should be considered to better understand the microwave-tissue interaction and treatment endpoints for different size renal masses before widespread use.", " We previously reported a new management variable, work rate, defined as work load due per hour, based on cumulative standard treatment times. We found that work rates were unachievable (ie, exceeded 1 hour of scheduled work per hour of available labor) for 75% of scheduled due times, despite presumed achievable average work load. OBJECTIVE To determine the optimal strategy for creating work assignments based on work rate. METHODS A focus group used root-cause analysis to identify ways to balance assignments based on work rate. We surveyed employees to assess their willingness to start earlier. We determined the ratio of scheduled to unscheduled work during a 12-month period. The scheduled work comprised administering small-volume nebulizer, metered-dose inhaler, noninvasive ventilation, and mechanical ventilation. The unscheduled work consisted of all other modalities. We also developed a spreadsheet model to assess the effect of shifting the start time on work-rate distribution in a representative 24-hour period. RESULTS The focus group determined that starting treatments 1 hour earlier would help. Fifteen of the 24 clinicians surveyed responded, and 13 of the respondents were willing to start earlier. The scheduled work load averaged approximately 55% of the total work load, but there was high variability per assignment area (range 0-99%). The spreadsheet model showed that shifting treatment start times improved the distribution of work rate throughout the day, but did not guarantee that labor demand never outstrips supply. CONCLUSIONS Our studies to date suggest that: basing assignments on average work load leads to periods of unachievable work rate, resulting in missed treatments and staff dissatisfaction. We have only limited ability to reduce peaks in work rate, but staggering treatment times is effective. Fair assignment of work should differentiate scheduled from unscheduled work.", " We explored the safety of intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) or intra-arterial treatment (IAT) in patients with ischemic stroke on non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs, last intake <48 hours) in comparison with patients (1) taking vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) or (2) without previous anticoagulation (no-OAC). METHODS AND RESULTS This is a multicenter cohort pilot study. Primary outcome measures were (1) occurrence of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) in 3 categories: any ICH (ICHany), symptomatic ICH according to the criteria of the European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study II (ECASS-II) (sICHECASS-II) and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) thrombolysis trial (sICHNINDS); and (2) death (at 3 months). Cohorts were compared by using propensity score matching. Our NOAC cohort comprised 78 patients treated with IVT/IAT and the comparison groups of 441 VKA patients and 8938 no-OAC patients. The median time from last NOAC intake to IVT/IAT was 13 hours (interquartile range, 8-22 hours). In VKA patients, median pre-IVT/IAT international normalized ratio was 1.3 (interquartile range, 1.1-1.6). ICHany was observed in 18.4% NOAC patients versus 26.8% in VKA patients and 17.4% in no-OAC patients. sICHECASS-II and sICHNINDS occurred in 2.6%/3.9% NOAC patients, in comparison with 6.5%/9.3% of VKA patients and 5.0%/7.2% of no-OAC patients, respectively. At 3 months, 23.0% of NOAC patients in comparison with 26.9% of VKA patients and 13.9% of no-OAC patients had died. Propensity score matching revealed no statistically significant differences. CONCLUSIONS IVT/IAT in selected patients with ischemic stroke under NOAC treatment has a safety profile similar to both IVT/IAT in patients on subtherapeutic VKA treatment or in those without previous anticoagulation. However, further prospective studies are needed, including the impact of specific coagulation tests.", "The effect of prolonged electroporation-mediated human interleukin-10 (hIL-10) overexpression 24 hours before transplantation, combined with sequential human hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) overexpression into skeletal muscle on day 5, on rat lung allograft rejection was evaluated. Left lung allotransplantation was performed from Brown-Norway to Fischer-F344 rats. Gene transfer into skeletal muscle was enhanced by electroporation. Three groups were studied: group I animals (n = 5) received 2.5 \u03bcg pCIK-hIL-10 (hIL-10/CMV [cytomegalovirus] early promoter enhancer) on day -1 and 80 \u03bcg pCIK-HGF (HGF/CMV early promoter enhancer) on day 5. Group II animals (n = 4) received 2.5 \u03bcg pCIK-hIL-10 and pUbC-hIL-10 (hIL-10/pUbC promoter) on day -1. Control group III animals (n = 4) were treated by sham electroporation on days -1 and 5. All animals received daily nontherapeutic intraperitoneal dose of cyclosporin A (2.5 mg/kg) and were sacrificed on day 15. Graft oxygenation and allograft rejection were evaluated. Significant differences were found between study groups in graft oxygenation (Pao(2)) (P = .0028; group I vs. groups II and III, P < .01 each). Pao(2) was low in group II (31 \u00b1 1 mm Hg) and in group III controls (34 \u00b1 10 mm Hg), without statistically significant difference between these 2 groups (P = .54). In contrast, in group I, Pao(2) of recipients sequentially transduced with IL-10 and HGF plasmids was much improved, with 112 \u00b1 39 mm Hg (vs. groups II and III; P < .01 each), paralleled by reduced vascular and bronchial rejection (group I vs. groups II and III, P < .021 each). Sequential overexpression of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, followed by sequential and overlapping HGF overexpression on day 5, preserves lung function and reduces acute lung allograft rejection up to day 15 post transplant as compared to prolonged IL-10 overexpression alone.", "Peri-operative management of the risks of hemorrhage and thrombosis related to gastrointestinal surgery tailored to patient characteristics are part of daily multidisciplinary practice tasks. The goal of this update is to discuss current practices concerning antithrombosis prophylaxis and the management of recently developed anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents. The duration of prophylaxis is 1 month for oncological surgery. The recommended doses in bariatric surgery are twice daily injections of low-molecular weight heparin without exceeding a total dose of 10,000 IU/day. Dual antiplatelet therapy is necessary for 6 weeks after placement of bare-metal stents, from 6-12 months for drug-eluting stents, and 12 months after an acute coronary artery syndrome. Abrupt discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy exposes the patient to an increased risk of thrombosis. Data are insufficient to make specific recommendations for antiplatelet therapy in gastrointestinal surgery. For major digestive surgery, prescription of daily aspirin should be discussed case by case. If discontinuation of treatment is absolutely necessary, this should be as short as possible (aspirin: 3 days, ticagrelor and clopidogrel: 5 days, prasugrel: 7 days). The modalities for elective management of new oral anticoagulants are similar to those for classical vitamin K antagonists (VKA) therapy, except that any overlapping with heparin administration must be avoided. In the emergency setting, an algorithm can be proposed depending on the drug, the available coagulation tests and the interval before performing surgery.", " Up to two-thirds of patients are either dependent or dead 3 months after thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Loss of cerebral autoregulation may render patients with AIS vulnerable to decreases in mean arterial pressure (MAP). OBJECTIVE To determine whether a fall in MAP during intervention under general anesthesia (GA) affects functional outcome. METHODS This subgroup analysis included patients from the MR CLEAN trial treated with thrombectomy under GA. The investigated variables were the difference between MAP at baseline and average MAP during GA (\u0394MAP) as well as the difference between baseline MAP and the lowest MAP during GA (\u0394LMAP). Their association with a shift towards better outcome on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) after 90 days was determined using ordinal logistic regression with adjustment for prognostic baseline variables. RESULTS Sixty of the 85 patients treated under GA in MR CLEAN had sufficient anesthetic information available for the analysis. A greater \u0394MAP was associated with worse outcome (adjusted common OR (acOR) 0.95 per point mm Hg, 95% CI 0.92 to 0.99). An average MAP during GA 10 mm Hg lower than baseline MAP constituted a 1.67 times lower odds of a shift towards good outcome on the mRS. For \u0394LMAP this association was not significant (acOR 0.97 per mm Hg, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.00, p=0.09). CONCLUSIONS A decrease in MAP during intervention under GA compared with baseline is associated with worse outcome. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER NTR1804; ISRCTN10888758; post-results.", "PURPOSE The selection of a laparoscopic approach for inguinal hernias varies among surgeons. It is unclear what is being done in actual practice. The purpose of this study was to report practice patterns for treatment of inguinal hernias among Quebec surgeons, and to identify factors that may be associated with the choice of operative approach. METHODS We studied a population-based cohort of patients who underwent an inguinal hernia repair between 2007 and 2011 in Quebec, Canada. A generalized linear model was used to identify predictors associated with the selection of a laparoscopic approach. RESULTS 49,657 inguinal hernias were repaired by 478 surgeons. Laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair (LIHR) was used in 8 % of all cases. LIHR was used to repair 28 % of bilateral hernias, 10 % of recurrent hernias, 6 % of unilateral hernias, and 4 % of incarcerated hernias. 268 (56 %) surgeons did not perform any laparoscopic repairs, and 11 (2 %) surgeons performed more than 100 repairs. These 11 surgeons performed 61 % of all laparoscopic cases. Patient factors significantly associated with having LIHR included younger age, fewer comorbidities, bilateral hernias, and recurrent hernias. CONCLUSION An open approach is favored for all clinical scenarios, even for situations where published guidelines recommend a laparoscopic approach. Surgeons remain divided on the best technique for inguinal hernia repair: while more than half never perform LIHR, the small proportion who perform many use the technique for a large proportion of their cases. There appears to be a gap between the best practices put forth in guidelines and what surgeons are doing in actual practice. Identification of barriers to the broader uptake of LIHR may help inform the design of educational programs to train those who have the desire to offer this technique for certain cases, and have the volume to overcome the learning curve.", " It has been reported that early clot removal benefits patients with iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis (DVT) by removing obstruction and preserving valve function. However, a substantial number of patients who had successful clot removal develop post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). Residual thrombus and rethrombosis play a part in this phenomenon, but the role of coexisting primary chronic venous disease (PCVD) in these patients has not been studied. METHODS All patients who underwent catheter-based techniques of thrombus removal for symptomatic acute iliofemoral DVT during a 5-year period compose the study group. These patients were assessed for PTS by the Villalta scale, the Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS), and the Venous Insufficiency Epidemiological and Economic Study on Quality of Life (VEINES-QOL) questionnaire. The presence of coexisting PCVD was determined by clinical and duplex ultrasound findings in the contralateral leg at the time of the initial DVT diagnosis. Patients who had coexisting PCVD were compared with those without PCVD. RESULTS Forty patients (40 limbs) were included in the study group. At initial diagnosis, 15 patients (38%) had coexisting symptomatic primary valve reflux in the unaffected limb. After thrombolysis, 9 of 40 limbs (22%) had complete lysis, 29 (73%) had \u2265 50% to 99% lysis, and 2 (5%) had <50% lysis. The mean percentage of lysis in patients with or without PCVD was similar (78% vs 86%; P = .13). Patients without coexisting PCVD had significantly better Villalta score and VCSS compared with those with coexisting PCVD (Villalta score, 2.52 vs 3.27, P = .014; VCSS, 2.96 vs 3.29, P = .005). Forty-five percent of patients (18 of 40) developed PTS. Patients who developed PTS had less clot lysis than those without PTS. This was true for patients with coexisting PCVD (60% vs 85%; P = .025) and in patients without PCVD (75% vs 89%; P = .013). There was no significant difference in the VEINES-QOL score between those with or without PCVD (79.5 vs 80.5; P = .9). Patients who had reflux in the treated limb after lysis had a five times greater chance for development of PTS compared with those who retained normal valve function during follow-up (odds ratio, 5.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.6-17.045). However, in patients with normal veins in the contralateral leg, the chance of development of PTS was 1.5 times higher if reflux was present in the treated limb (odds ratio, 1.49; 95% confidence interval, 0.043-10.253). CONCLUSIONS Coexisting PCVD is a contributing factor to development of PTS after treatment of iliofemoral DVT with thrombus removal techniques.", "UNLABELLED Renal sympathetic denervation (RDN) is an emerging technique in the treatment of resistant hypertension, most commonly performed using an endovascular approach. Clinical and anatomical criteria for RDN are well established and imaging plays an integral role in selecting patients with suitable anatomy, procedural planning and device selection. Nevertheless, the current body of literature surrounding imaging related to RDN remains limited. The purpose of this article is to illustrate the expectations and limitations of various imaging techniques, including Doppler ultrasound, CT angiography, MR angiography and newer techniques such as non-contrast MR angiography, in the context of RDN. KEY POINTS \u2022 To understand the role of imaging in renal denervation \u2022 To understand strengths and weaknesses of current imaging techniques \u2022 To understand the relevant imaging findings in the context of renal denervation.", " Surgery for failed antireflux procedures is technically more demanding than primary fundoplication. The success rate does not equal that of the primary procedures. This retrospective analysis aimed to assess long-term subjective and objective outcomes in patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery for fundoplication failure. METHODS Objective and subjective outcomes were assessed by radiological and endoscopic methods, symptom questionnaire and quality-of-life index at a minimum follow-up of 12 (mean 75\u00b78) months. RESULTS The study included 129 consecutive patients who had laparoscopic redo surgery after fundoplication had failed. The most frequent patterns of failure were hiatal herniation (50 patients) and slippage (45). Resolution of the symptoms that led to redo surgery was achieved in 27 of 37 and 11 of 16 patients operated for recurrence and for dysphagia respectively. Objective failure was demonstrated in 16 of 39 patients with herniation and six of 22 with slippage. Seven patients underwent an additional surgical procedure. CONCLUSION Long-term assessment of objective and subjective results after laparoscopic repair for failed fundoplication revealed a high failure rate that increased with the length of follow-up. Unexpected and untreated oesophageal shortening may be responsible for this failure rate.", " Hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery is commonly used in colorectal surgery and provides benefit in complex cases. OBJECTIVE This study examined the minimally invasive surgical trends, patient characteristics, and operative variables unique to patients undergoing hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery. DESIGN This was a retrospective medical chart review. SETTINGS The study was conducted in a tertiary care medical center. PATIENTS Patients included in the study were those who underwent pure laparoscopic colectomies, hand-assisted laparoscopic colectomies, and traditional open surgery for elective treatment of diverticular disease, colorectal cancer, IBD, and benign polyp disease. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Primary outcomes included patient characteristics and operative variables unique to patients undergoing hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery and documentation of operative technique trends within an experienced colorectal group. RESULTS Diverticular disease characteristics specific to hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery included the presence of dense inflammatory adhesions (p < 0.0001), diverticular fistulas (p < 0.0001), and unresolved phlegmon (p = 0.0003). Characteristics specific for colorectal cancer included intraoperative tumor bulk (p < 0.0001) and the inability to achieve appropriate surgical resection margins (p < 0.001). Similarly, variables identified for benign polyp disease included adhesions (p < 0.0001) and the ability to gain adequate exposure (p < 0.0001). Limited use of hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery was observed in patients with IBD. LIMITATIONS This was a retrospective, observational study from a single center. CONCLUSIONS Conversion to hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery provides benefit in surgical scenarios where dense inflammatory adhesions, diverticular fistulas, and intra-abdominal postdiverticulitis phlegmon are present. In addition, benefit is observed in patients with colorectal cancer where laparoscopic dissection of bulky tumor proves to be difficult and where the technical ability to obtain margins using pure laparoscopy is compromised. Although our practice has changed to favor pure laparoscopy, hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery continues to play an important role in complex colorectal cases that otherwise would require open surgery (see video, Supplemental Digital Content 1, https://links.lww.com/DCR/A146).", "EUS-guided fine-needle ethanol injection (FNI) therapy of some types of cystic and solid tumors has been documented. However, reported cases to date of gastrointestinal-stromal tumors (GIST) treated with this technique are scarce. Ethanol ablation is an alternative treatment with a low rate of adverse events in selected cases.", "Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a treatment for hematologic malignancies, immune deficiencies, or genetic diseases, ect. Recently, the number of HSCTs performed in Korea has increased and the outcomes have improved. However, infectious complications account for most of the morbidity and mortality after HSCT. Post-HSCT infectious complications are usually classified according to the time after HSCT: pre-engraftment, immediate post-engraftment, and late post-engraftment period. In addition, the types and risk factors of infectious complications differ according to the stem cell source, donor type, conditioning intensity, region, prophylaxis strategy, and comorbidities, such as graft-versushost disease and invasive fungal infection. In this review, we summarize infectious complications after HSCT, focusing on the Korean perspectives.", "Background and summary: Among all vulvar cancers, primary adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) of Bartholin's gland is a very rare tumor characterized by a slow growth, a high local aggressiveness, and a remarkable recurrence rate. Due to its rarity, treatment remains a challenge for oncologists and gynecological surgeons. Key message: The present paper reports clinical, radiological, and histological features of ACC of Bartholin's gland and reviews the literature data on the treatment options with a particular focus on the potential role of particle radiation therapy.", "Highly pathogenic Nipah virus (NiV) generally causes severe encephalitis in humans. Respiratory symptoms are infrequently observed, likely reflecting variations in infection kinetics in human airways. Supporting this idea, we recently identified individual differences in NiV replication kinetics in cultured airway epithelia from different human donors. As type III interferons (IFN-\u03bb) represent major players in the defence mechanism against viral infection of the respiratory mucosa, we studied IFN-\u03bb induction and antiviral activity in NiV-infected primary differentiated human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEpCs) cultured under air-liquid interface conditions. Our studies revealed that IFN-\u03bb was upregulated in airway epithelia upon NiV infection. We also show that IFN-\u03bb pretreatment efficiently inhibited NiV replication. Interestingly, the antiviral activity of IFN-\u03bb varied in HBEpCs from two different donors. Increased sensitivity to IFN-\u03bb was associated with higher expression levels of IFN-\u03bb receptors, enhanced phosphorylation of STAT1, as well as enhanced induction of interferon-stimulated gene expression. These findings suggest that individual variations in IFN-\u03bb receptor expression affecting IFN responsiveness can play a functional role for NiV replication kinetics in human respiratory epithelial cells of different donors.", "PURPOSE The selection of a laparoscopic approach for inguinal hernias varies among surgeons.

Various surgical interventions categorized collectively as bariatric surgery now play an ever-increasing important role as the only known effective treatment for severe obesity. Laparoscopic gastric bypass is currently the most frequent bariatric surgical procedure performed. However, the laparoscopic adjustable gastric band (LAGB) is rapidly gaining in popularity as a minimally invasive surgical option with anticipated similarly efficacious outcomes. Gastric band erosion following LAGB is an uncommon yet potentially serious complication unique to this form of weight loss surgery. METHODS Case report and literature review. RESULTS We report a case of a pyogenic liver abscess related to a LAGB procedure. Apropos to this case, we review the presumed pathophysiologic mechanism of this particular infectious process, and discuss this and other complications associated with LAGB operations. CONCLUSIONS As LAGB bariatric procedures become more popular, clinicians need to be aware of uncommon, but potentially serious complications unique to this form of weight loss surgery.", " AND PURPOSE Data on safety and efficacy of periprocedural use of heparin are limited during treatment of acute ischemic stroke patients with anterior circulation tandem occlusion. This study aimed to investigate the impact of heparin use during endovascular therapy of anterior circulation tandem occlusions on the functional and safety outcomes. METHODS A retrospective analysis of the multicenter observational TITAN registry was performed. Patients with anterior circulation tandem occlusion and treated with endovascular therapy (EVT) were included, with or without extracranial carotid intervention. We divided patients into two groups based on periprocedural heparin use (heparin vs. non-heparin). The dose of intravenous unfractionated heparin ranged from 1500 to 2500 I.U. Primary study endpoint was 90-day Modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Secondary study endpoint included angiographic and safety endpoints such as hemorrhagic complications. A propensity-score-matched analysis was performed. RESULTS Among 369 patients, heparin was used in 68 patients (18.4%). In the propensity-score-matched cohort, favorable outcome (mRS 0-2) occurred in 51.3% in heparin group and 58.0% in non-heparin group (matched OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.32-1.78; P = 0.52). Similar result was found in propensity-score-adjusted cohort (adjusted OR, 0.72; 95%CI, 0.39-1.32; P = 0.28). Likewise, there was no difference in the rate of successful reperfusion (mTICI 2b-3) (propensity-score-adjusted OR, 1.03; 95%CI, 0.50-2.09; P = 0.93) neither in safety endpoints between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS Periprocedural heparin use during EVT of anterior circulation tandem occlusions was not associated with better functional, angiographic or safety outcomes. These findings are applicable for low doses of heparin, and further studies are warranted.", " In patients with large vessel occlusions, endovascular treatment has been shown to be superior to intravenous thrombolysis in recent trials. AIMS The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of endovascular treatment on clinical and radiological outcome in everyday clinical practice. METHODS We compared the rates of good outcome (modified Rankin scale \u2264 2 at discharge), in-hospital death, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhages, and infarct sizes in patients with distal intracranial carotid artery, M1 and M2 occlusions during two time periods. RESULTS From January 2008 to October 2012, a total of 509 patients were treated with intravenous thrombolysis and from November 2012 to December 2014, a total of 270 patients received endovascular treatment with stent retrievers (with or without intravenous thrombolysis). Significantly, more patients in the endovascular treatment group than in the intravenous thrombolysis group had a good outcome (37% vs. 27%, p < 0.01). The infarct sizes were significantly smaller after endovascular treatment than intravenous thrombolysis, whereas the symptomatic intracranial hemorrhages rates and in-hospital mortality were comparable between both treatment groups. The positive impact of endovascular treatment on clinical outcome was most pronounced in patients \u226575 years (31% endovascular treatment vs. 19% intravenous thrombolysis, p < 0.01), in patients with M1 occlusions (43% endovascular treatment vs. 25% intravenous thrombolysis, p < 0.01) and in patients with an admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale \u2265 14 (24% endovascular treatment vs. 11% intravenous thrombolysis, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION In everyday clinical practice and compared with intravenous thrombolysis, endovascular treatment significantly improved clinical outcome and was associated with smaller infarctions. This beneficial effect appeared to be highest in older patients, more severely affected patients, and in those with M1 occlusions.", "OBJECTIVE: Physician-modified fenestrated stent grafts (PMSGs) are a useful option for urgent or semiurgent treatment of complex abdominal aortic aneurysms (CAAAs). The aim of this study was to describe in-hospital outcomes of custom-made fenestrated stent grafts (CMSGs) and PMSGs for the treatment of CAAAs and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAAs). METHODS: In this single-center, retrospective study, all consecutives patients with CAAAs or TAAAs undergoing endovascular repair using Zenith CMSGs (Cook Medical, Bloomington, Ind) or PMSGs between January 2012 and November 2017 were included. End points were intraoperative adverse events, in-hospital mortality, postoperative complications, reinterventions, target vessel patency, and endoleaks. RESULTS: Ninety-seven patients were included (CMSGs, n = 69; PMSGs, n = 28). The PMSG group included more patients assigned to American Society of Anesthesiologists class 4 (n = 14 [50%] vs n = 16 [23%]; P = .006) and more TAAAs (n = 17 [61%] vs n = 10 [15%]; P < .0001). Intraoperative adverse events were recorded in eight (11%) patients in the CMSG group vs six (21%) patients in the PMSG group. No intraoperative death or open conversion occurred. In-hospital mortality rates were of 4% (n = 3) in the CMSG group and 14% in the PMSG group (n = 4). Chronic renal failure was an independent preoperative risk factor of postoperative death or complications (odds ratio, 4.88; 95% confidence interval, 1.65-14.43; P = .004). Rates of postoperative complications were 22% (n = 15) and 25% (n = 7) in the CMSG and PMSG groups. Spinal cord ischemia rates were 4% (n = 3) and 7% (n = 2) in the CMSG and PMSG groups. Reintervention rates were 16% (n = 11) in the CMSG group and 32% (n = 9) in the PMSG group. At discharge, target vessel patency rate in CMSGs was 98% (n = 207/210). All target vessels (n = 98) were patent in the PMSG group. Endoleaks at discharge were observed in 24% of the CMSG group (n = 16) vs 8% of the PMSG group (n = 2). CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed clinically relevant differences of several important in-hospital outcomes in the CMSG and PMSG groups. Larger cohorts and longer follow-up are needed to allow direct comparison. PMSGs may offer acceptable in-hospital results in patients requiring urgent interventions when CMSGs are not available or possible.", "Human deciduous periodontal ligament stem cells have been introduced for as an easily accessible source of stem cells from dental origin. Although recent studies have revealed the ability of these stem cells in multipotential attribute, their efficiency of hepatic lineage differentiation has not been addressed so far. The aim of this study is to investigate hepatic lineage fate competence of periodontal ligament stem cells through direct media induction. Differentiation of periodontal ligament stem cells into hepatocyte-like cells was conducted by the exposure of two phase media induction. First phase was performed in the presence of hepatocyte growth factors to induce a definitive endoderm formation. In the subsequent phase, the cells were treated with oncostatin M and dexamethosone followed by insulin and transferrin to generate hepatocyte-like cells. Hepatic-related characters of the generated hepatocyte-like cells were determined at both mRNA and protein level followed by functional assays. Foremost changes observed in the generation of hepatocyte-like cells were the morphological features in which these cells were transformed from fibroblastic shape to polygonal shape. Temporal expression of hepatic markers ranging from early endodermal up to late markers were detected in the hepatocyte-like cells. Crucial hepatic markers such as glycogen storage, albumin, and urea secretion were also shown. These findings exhibited the ability of periodontal ligament stem cells of dental origin to be directed into hepatic lineage fate. These cells can be regarded as an alternative autologous source in the usage of stem cell-based treatment for liver diseases.", " Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). There is no specific cure for this disease, and the clinical management mainly depends on supportive treatment. Traditional Chinese medicines (CHM) is widely used in treating COVID-19 in China. METHODS A comprehensive literature search will be conducted. Two methodological trained researchers will read the title, abstract, and full texts and independently select the qualified literature according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. After assessment of the risk of bias and data extraction, we will conduct meta-analyses for outcomes related to COVID-19. The heterogeneity of data will be investigated by Cochrane \u03c7 and I tests. Then publication bias assessment will be conducted by funnel plot analysis and Egger test. RESULTS The results of our research will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. CONCLUSION Our study aims to systematically present the clinical evidence of CHM in the treatment of COVID-19, which will be of guiding significance for further research and clinical practice. OSF REGISTRATION NUMBER 10.17605/OSF.IO/H7GMU.", "PURPOSE To test the efficacy of internally CO2-cooled radiofrequency (RF) ablation in vivo and to compare its effectiveness to a standard water-cooled RF probe and to a gas-cooled microwave (MW) device. METHOD AND MATERIALS 49 ablations were performed on 15 pigs under general anesthesia using 15G monopolar CO2-cooled RF applicators, 17G monopolar water-cooled RF applicators and 15G internally CO2-cooled microwave devices. The power of the MW device was 45W, the current of the gas-cooled RF device was 1200-1600mA. At the water-cooled RF probe, maximum power of 200W was set. Ablation time was 15min. The short and long axes of the ablation zone were measured. Histological analyses and NADH-staining were performed. The diameters and the ablation volumes were compared using an analysis of variance. RESULTS No spots of untreated tissue were observed close to the cooled needle track in any of the ablation zones. The largest short axis diameter was 3.4\u00b10.5cm achieved with the gas-cooled monopolar applicator. With the water-cooled applicators, short axis diameter was significantly smaller, reaching 2.5\u00b10.4cm. Gas-cooled MW probes achieved 2.9\u00b11.0cm. The largest ablation volume was 31.5\u00b112ml (gas-cooled RF), and the smallest was 12.7\u00b14ml (water-cooled RF). Short/long axis ratio was largest for gas-cooled RF probes with 0.73\u00b10.08 versus 0.64\u00b10.04 for the water-cooled probes and 0.49\u00b10.25 for the microwave applicator. CONCLUSION Gas-cooled RF applicators may have a higher potential for effective destruction of liver lesions than comparable water-cooled RF systems, and may be an alternative to standard RF and MW ablation devices.", "OBJECTIVES The risk of developing venous thromboembolism (VTE) in urologic patients undergoing major surgery without thromboprophylaxis is high (up to 40%). The aims were to study the acceptability rate of and overall patient satisfaction with an automatic sequential leg compression system and the short-term effectiveness of a combined VTE prevention modality. METHODS One-hundred and eighty-four consecutive patients undergoing radical retropubic prostatectomy were postoperatively treated with enoxaparine and intermittent pneumatic compression of the thigh. By completing a questionnaire, the patients were prospectively studied to evaluate the comfort and tolerability of a compression device (SCD Response Compression System; Covidien, Gosport, UK). The patients were monitored for complications and development of VTE for up to 4 weeks postoperatively. The device used ensures customized and effective compression therapy matching the patient's individual vascular refill by sequential, gradient, circumferential microprocessor-controlled compression cycles. RESULTS No clinically evident VTE, critical bleeding or postoperative death occurred during the study period. Drain output was associated with transfusion requirement (p < 0.001), obesity (p < 0.02) and longer operation duration (p < 0.001). The sequential compression devices were well tolerated by 63% of the patients, in that the sleeves were judged as being pleasant (72%) and nonoppressive (79%). Patients reported bothersome insomnia (23%) and noise (44%), and early removal was required in 3%. CONCLUSIONS Combined mechanical and pharmacological thromboprophylaxis was highly effective, well tolerated, and safe. The device tested showed a high comfort and tolerability profile. The use of combined modalities for VTE prophylaxis is justified in patients at very high risk of VTE, such as those undergoing radical retropubic prostatectomy.", "Many complications in craniofacial surgery can be attributed to a lack of characterization of facial skeletal strain patterns. This study aimed to delineate human midfacial strain patterns under uniform muscle loading. The left sides of 5 fresh-frozen human cadaveric heads were dissected of all soft tissues except the temporalis and masseter muscles. Tensile forces were applied to the free mandibular ends of the muscles. Maxillary alveolar arches were used to restrain the skulls. Eight strain gauges were bonded to the surface of the midface to measure the strain under single muscle loading conditions (100 N). Maxillary strain gauges revealed a biaxial load state for both muscles. Thin antral bone experienced high maximum principal tensile strains (maximum of 685.5 \u03bc\u03b5) and high minimum principal compressive strains (maximum of -722.44 \u03bc\u03b5). Similar biaxial patterns of lower magnitude were measured on the zygoma (maximum of 208.59 \u03bc\u03b5 for maximum principal strains and -78.11 \u03bc\u03b5 for minimum principal strains). Results, consistent for all specimens and counter to previously accepted concepts of biomechanical behavior of the midface under masticatory muscle loading, included high strain in the thin maxillary antral wall, rotational bending through the maxilla and zygoma, and a previously underestimated contribution of the temporalis muscle. This experimental model produced repeatable strain patterns quantifying the mechanics of the facial skeleton. These new counterintuitive findings underscore the need for accurate characterization of craniofacial strain patterns to address problems in the current treatment methods and develop robust design criteria.", "STUDY DESIGN The effects of a low, local dose of a tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitor on neuropathic pain behaviors in a rat chronic constriction injury model were evaluated. OBJECTIVE To investigate whether a peripherally implanted polymer drug depot can deliver a dose of etanercept sufficient to reduce thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia in a rat model of neuropathic pain. SUMMARY OF  DATA TNF-alpha inhibitors reduce pain-associated behavior in experimental models of neuropathic pain. Moreover, systemic injections of TNF-alpha inhibitors have suggested some efficacy in treating sciatic pain in limited, off-label clinical studies. Improvements in these results may be obtained by optimal dosing via targeted, sustained delivery at the site of disc-induced inflammation. METHODS Unilateral chronic constriction injury was applied to the sciatic nerve of 56 male, Wistar rats. Four groups of animals (n = 7) received 0.5 mL phosphate-buffered saline every 3 days, 0.3 or 3 mg/kg etanercept every 3 days, or gabapentin (60 mg/kg) 1 hour before each behavioral test all via subcutaneous injection. Two groups of animals received 1.5 or 3.0 microg/h etanercept delivered by poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) millicylinders (1 mm diameter x 10 mm long) implanted near the injured sciatic nerve. One group received a PLGA millicylinder implanted near the injured sciatic nerve. The final group received 3.0 microg/h etanercept via PLGA millicylinder implanted next to the uninjured, contralateral sciatic nerve. RESULTS A low, local dose of etanercept (approximately 3 microg/h) delivered by a polymer depot significantly reduced (P < 0.05) thermal hyperalgesia for 57 days as compared to polymer depot without drug or an etanercept-loaded depot implanted near the contralateral sciatic nerve, and equivalent to a 10-fold higher dose delivered by repeat subcutaneous injection. CONCLUSION This preclinical study indicates that delivering TNF-alpha inhibitors by means of a locally administered polymeric formulation provides long-lasting analgesia in an inflammatory neuropathic pain model.", "PURPOSE The ideal approach to complex ventral hernia repair is frequently debated. Differences in processing techniques among biologic materials may impact hernia repair outcomes. This study evaluates the outcomes of hernia repair with a terminally sterilized human acellular dermal matrix (TS-HADM) (AlloMax(\u00ae) Surgical Graft, by C. R. Bard/Davol, Inc., Warwick, RI, USA) treated with low-dose gamma irradiation. METHODS A single-arm multi-center retrospective observational study of patients undergoing hernia repair with TS-HADM was performed. Data analyses were exploratory only; no formal hypothesis testing was pre-specified. RESULTS Seventy-eight patients (43F, 35M) underwent incisional hernia repair with a TS-HADM. Mean follow-up was 20.5 months. Preoperative characteristics include age of 56.6 \u00b1 11.1 years, BMI 36.7 \u00b1 9.9 kg/m(2), and mean hernia defect size 187 cm(2). Sixty-five patients underwent component separation technique (CST) with a reinforcing graft. Overall, 21.8% developed recurrences. Recurrences occurred in 15% of patients repaired with CST. Major wound complications occurred in 31% of patients overall. Based upon CDC surgical wound classification, major wound complications were seen in 26, 40, 56, and 50% of Class 1, 2, 3, and 4 wounds, respectively. No grafts required removal. CONCLUSIONS Hernia recurrences are not uncommon following complex abdominal wall reconstruction. Improved outcomes are seen when a TS-HADM is utilized as reinforcement to primary fascial closure.", "Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We describe the case of a 59-year-old man who presented with headache, hypertension and a single episode of fever with no other symptoms. He subsequently developed unilateral weakness. Computer tomography identified a cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST). A subsequent test for COVID-19 was positive. This is the first report of CVST as a presenting symptom of COVID-19 infection. LEARNING POINTS: Thrombotic events may be the initial presenting symptom of COVID-19. These thrombotic events include stroke, venous thromboembolism, pulmonary embolism and cardiac complications. Clinicians should carefully consider the risk of thrombosis in patients positive for COVID-19, including prophylaxis and treatment beyond discharge.", "Diaphragmatic plication has been a well employed method for the treatment of diaphragmatic eventration and/or paralysis. Uniportal thoracoscopic procedures seem to offer substantial benefit in terms of postoperative pain and cosmesis with similar outcomes as other surgical techniques. A 60-year-old female patient was referred to our clinic for the surgical treatment of diaphragmatic eventration of an unknown cause. The patient was referred to our institution from another hospital, where she had undergone a femoro-popliteal and crural bypass which was unsuccessful, requiring amputation of her leg. Following surgery, she was unable to breath spontaneously without any specific reason. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging showed no pathology and the neurologists did not have a diagnosis for her comatose state. There was consensus in both hospitals that surgical plication of her elevated diaphragm might be the only option for respiratory improvement. We performed a double-lined diaphragmatic plication procedure by means of uniportal video-assisted thoracic surgery technique with CO2 insufflation using GelPort. Despite the time-consuming adhesiolysis and the need for lung suturing at the end of the procedure, the operative time was 120 min. Oxygenation remarkably improved after the operation, yet the patient remained in comatose state. She was referred back to the hospital where she had initially begun her therapy for further recovery.", "Renal afferent and efferent sympathetic nerves are involved in the regulation of blood pressure and have a pathophysiological role in hypertension. Renal sympathetic denervation is a novel therapeutic technique for the treatment of patients with resistant hypertension. Clinical trials of renal sympathetic denervation have shown significant reductions in blood pressure in these patients. Renal sympathetic denervation also reduces heart rate, which is a surrogate marker of cardiovascular risk. Conditions that are comorbid with hypertension, such as heart failure and myocardial hypertrophy, obstructive sleep apnoea, atrial fibrillation, renal dysfunction, and metabolic syndrome are closely associated with enhanced sympathetic activity. In experimental models and case-control studies, renal denervation has had beneficial effects on these conditions. Renal denervation could become a commonly used procedure to treat resistant hypertension and chronic diseases associated with enhanced sympathetic activation. Current work is focused on refining the techniques and interventional devices to provide safe and effective renal sympathetic denervation. Controlled studies in patients with mild-to-moderate, nonresistant hypertension and comorbid conditions such as heart failure, diabetes mellitus, sleep apnoea, and arrhythmias are needed to investigate the capability of renal sympathetic denervation to improve cardiovascular outcomes.", "This is a protocol for a Cochrane Review (Intervention). The objectives are as follows: To assess the effectiveness and safety of yoga for treatment of urinary incontinence in women, compared to no specific treatment, to another active treatment, or to an active treatment without adjuvant yoga, with a focus on patient symptoms and quality of life.", " In the short-term, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy has been shown to be effective for the treatment of the type 2 diabetes in patients with severe obesity. There are few data with greater follow-up. Our aim was to evaluate the results of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy on the control of type 2 diabetes in patients with severe obesity at 5 years at the University Hospital, France. METHODS From a total of 355 patients with severe obesity operated between January 2006 and June 2010, 52 (15%) had a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes before undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. RESULTS There were 31 females (60%) and 21 males (40%), with a mean age of 51 \u00b1 10 years (range 27-67) with a mean body mass index of 48 \u00b1 10 kg/m2 (range 35-82). The mean duration of type 2 diabetes was 10.8 \u00b1 10.8 years before bariatric operation. The preoperative glycated hemoglobin was 8 \u00b1 2% (range 5.9-12.8) in 45 patients; 17 patients (38%) had levels of glycated hemoglobin \u22659%. Three patients (6%) required insulin alone, 4 (8%) were taking oral antidiabetic medicine and insulin, and the remaining 45 patients (87%) were taking only oral antidiabetic medicines. The complete data regarding weight loss at 5-year follow-up were obtained for 46 patients, yielding an overall follow-up rate of 89%. The prolonged remission of type 2 diabetes achieved at 1 year that persisted at 5 years of follow-up was present in 9 patients (17%). No patient with complete remission of their type 2 diabetes required insulin preoperatively. Improvement of type 2 diabetes was observed in 30 patients (58%) at 1 year, which was maintained for 27 patients (52%) at 5-year follow-up. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy has demonstrated a moderate efficacy in the treatment morbidly obese patients with type 2 diabetes. Markedly increased preoperative glycated hemoglobin levels, older age, and preoperative need for insulin treatment may be the factors predicting failure of complete remission of type 2 diabetes after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy.", "Arteriovenous malformations of the head and neck are difficult to treat and require a multidisciplinary approach. Interventional radiology can now be used to downgrade previously inoperable lesions to enable ablation, and the use of Onyx\u00ae (Covidien, Irvine, CA, USA), which has revolutionised their management by allowing precise obliteration of the nidus, has enabled the aggressive management of lesions in compromised anatomical areas. We report a series of 31 patients with lesions on the head and neck. They all presented with serious symptoms (Schobinger grade 2-3) and had embolisation with Onyx\u00ae. Some had additional operations. We describe the outcome including complications, and offer some lessons learned from our experience.", " Aneurysm recanalization remains a limitation of endovascular treatment. A new type of bioactive coil, the polyglycolic/polylactic acid-covered platinum microfilaments Nexus coil (ev3/Covidien, Irvine, CA, USA), has been proposed. The objective is to evaluate the safety and short-term and mid-term efficacy of Nexus coils in the endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms. METHODS The ENDECOR (European Nexus Detachable Coil Registry) is the first prospective, consecutive, multicenter non-randomized registry. After providing informed consent, 390 patients (238 women and 152 men; mean age, 51.6 years) with 404 ruptured or unruptured aneurysms were enrolled at 34 centers. Treatment was performed with at least 75 % of coil length as Nexus coils. Clinical and technical complications were systematically reported. An independent core laboratory evaluated angiographic results by using the Raymond Grading Scale. RESULTS Complete occlusion was seen in 181 aneurysms (48 %); neck remnant in 86 aneurysms (22 %) and aneurysm remnant in 111 aneurysms (30 %). Technical and clinical complications related to the procedure occurred in 33 patients (8.5 %). At discharge, overall mortality and permanent-morbidity were 4.1 % (16/390) and 5.6 % (14/251), respectively. Angiographic mean follow-up of 13.3 months was obtained in 233 of 390 patients (64.4 %) harboring 247 aneurysms. Recanalization was observed in 44 aneurysms (17.7 %), and progressive thrombosis was observed in 53 aneurysms (21.6 %). CONCLUSIONS Endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms with Nexus coils was associated with low morbidity and mortality rates. Efficacy of Nexus coils was comparable to published series of intracranial aneurysms treated with bare platinum coils, but their efficacy to prevent aneurysm recanalization was not demonstrated.", ": Recent studies have shown that gamma interferon (IFN-\u03b3) synergizes with the innate IFNs (IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2) to inhibit herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) replication in vitro. To determine whether this phenomenon is shared by other herpesviruses, we investigated the effects of IFNs on human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) replication. RESULTS: We have found that as with HSV-1, IFN-\u03b3 synergizes with the innate IFNs (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) to potently inhibit HCMV replication in vitro. While pre-treatment of human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) with IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2 or IFN-\u03b3 alone inhibited HCMV plaque formation by ~30 to 40-fold, treatment with IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 or IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 inhibited HCMV plaque formation by 163- and 662-fold, respectively. The generation of isobole plots verified that the observed inhibition of HCMV plaque formation and replication in HFFs by IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 was a synergistic interaction. Additionally, real-time PCR analyses of the HCMV immediate early (IE) genes (IE1 and IE2) revealed that IE mRNA expression was profoundly decreased in cells stimulated with IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 (~5-11-fold) as compared to vehicle-treated cells. Furthermore, decreased IE mRNA expression was accompanied by a decrease in IE protein expression, as demonstrated by western blotting and immunofluorescence. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 synergistically inhibit HCMV replication through a mechanism that may involve the regulation of IE gene expression. We hypothesize that IFN-\u03b3 produced by activated cells of the adaptive immune response may potentially synergize with endogenous type I IFNs to inhibit HCMV dissemination in vivo.", " Repetitive peripheral magnetic stimulation (rPMS) is a form of therapy that creates painless stimulation of deep muscle structures to improve motor function in people with physical impairment from brain or nerve disorders. Use of rPMS for people after stroke has been identified as a feasible approach to improve activities of daily living and functional ability. However, no systematic reviews have assessed the findings of available trials. The effect and safety of this intervention for people after stroke currently remain uncertain. OBJECTIVES To assess the effect of rPMS for improving activities of daily living and functional ability in people after stroke. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (August 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 8) in the Cochrane Library (August 2016), MEDLINE Ovid (November 2016), Embase Ovid (August 2016), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) in Ebsco (August 2016), PsycINFO Ovid (August 2016), the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED) Ovid (August 2016), Occupational Therapy Systematic Evaluation of Evidence (OTseeker) (August 2016), the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) (October 2016), and ICHUSHI Web (October 2016). We also searched five ongoing trial registries, screened reference lists, and contacted experts in the field. We placed no restrictions on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) conducted to assess the therapeutic effect of rPMS for people after stroke. Comparisons eligible for inclusion were (1) active rPMS only compared with 'sham' rPMS (a very weak form of stimulation or a sound only); (2) active rPMS only compared with no intervention; (3) active rPMS plus rehabilitation compared with sham rPMS plus rehabilitation; and (4) active rPMS plus rehabilitation compared with rehabilitation only. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion. The same review authors assessed methods and risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted trial authors to ask for unpublished information if necessary. We resolved all disagreements through discussion. MAIN RESULTS We included three trials (two RCTs and one cross-over trial) involving 121 participants. Blinding of participants and physicians was well reported in all trials, and overall risk of bias was low. We found no clear effect of rPMS on activities of daily living at the end of treatment (mean difference (MD) -3.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) -16.35 to 10.35; low-quality evidence) and at the end of follow-up (MD -2.00, 95% CI -14.86 to 10.86; low-quality evidence). Investigators in one study with 63 participants observed no statistical difference in improvement of upper limb function at the end of treatment (MD 2.00, 95% CI -4.91 to 8.91) and at the end of follow-up (MD 4.00, 95% CI -2.92 to 10.92). One trial with 18 participants showed that rPMS treatment was not associated with improved muscle strength at the end of treatment (MD 3.00, 95% CI -2.44 to 8.44). Another study reported a significant decrease in spasticity of the elbow at the end of follow-up (MD -0.48, 95% CI -0.93 to -0.03). No studies provided information on lower limb function and death. Based on the GRADE approach, we judged the certainty of evidence related to the primary outcome as low owing to the small sample size of one study. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Available trials provided inadequate evidence to permit any conclusions about routine use of rPMS for people after stroke. Additional trials with large sample sizes are needed to determine an appropriate rPMS protocol as well as long-term effects. We identified three ongoing trials and will include these trials in the next review update.", " Extracorporeal shock wave application (ESWA) has the potential to qualify as an adjuvant therapy option for soft tissue disorders such as chronic wounds. As of today, little is known about its exact mechanism of action. For a better understanding of the pathophysiology, we investigated the effect of ESWA on microcirculation and leukocyte-endothelial interaction. MATERIALS AND METHODS Intravital fluorescent microscopy was used to quantify microcirculatory parameters in the ears of hairless mice (n = 30). Values were obtained just before and 10 min after the ESWA (500 shots, 1 Hz, duration 500 s). Mice were randomly divided into three groups undergoing different shock wave intensities (energy flux density: control: 0.00 mJ/mm(2); low level: 0.015 mJ/mm(2); and higher level (hl): 0.04 mJ/mm(2); n = 10 mice per group). Histologic evaluations were taken after completion of the experiments. RESULTS A significant increase in the venular diameter was observed in both the groups that underwent ESWA compared with the control group (hl: 118%, low level: 117%, and control: 96%; P < 0.004). Edema formation increased significantly in group I (P = 0.002). ESWA provoked an arteriolar constriction (hl: 93% versus control: 104%; P = 0.019) 10 min after treatment. The highest value of venular blood flow was found in group hl. Moreover, shock waves increased significantly the number of sticking leukocytes immediately after application (hl: 274%, P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS ESWA has a significant and immediate impact on microcirculation with endothelial integrity loss and increase of adherent leukocytes as part of a proinflammatory process. Although a dilation of venules was caused, arterioles primarily show a constriction. The study shows alterations in microcirculation that could help understand the mechanism of action in the future.", " Unrecognized periprosthetic joint infections are a concern in revision surgery for aseptic failure (AF) after total hip (THA) or knee (TKA) arthroplasties. A gold diagnostic standard does not exist. The aim of the current study was to determine the prevalence of unrecognized periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) in a cohort of revision for AF, using an experimental diagnostic algorithm. METHODS The surgeons' suspicion of AF was based primarily on patient history and clinical evaluation. X-ray imaging was used to reveal mechanical problems. To rule out an infectious aetiology standard blood biochemical tests were ordered in most patients. Evaluation followed the existing practice in the institute. Cases were included if revision surgery was planned for suspected AF. Intraoperatively, five synovial tissue biopsies were obtained routinely. PJI was defined as \u22653 positive cultures with the same microorganism(s). Patients were followed for 1 year postoperatively. Protocol samples included joint fluid, additional synovial tissue biopsies, bone biopsy, swabs from the implant surface, and sonication of retrieved components. Routine and protocol samples were cultured with extended incubation (14 days) and preserved for batchwise 16S rRNA gene amplification. Patients were stratified based on culture results and a clinical status was obtained at study end. RESULTS A total of 72 revisions were performed on 71 patients (35 THA and 37 TKA). We found five of 72 cases of unrecognized PJI. Extended culture and protocol samples accounted for two of these. One patient diagnosed with AF was treated for a PJI during follow-up. The remaining patients did not change status from AF during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS We found a low prevalence of unrecognized periprosthetic joint infections in patients with an AF diagnosis. The algorithm strengthens the surgeons' preoperative diagnosis of a non-infective condition. Evaluation for a failing TKA or THA is complex. Distinguishing between AF and PJI pre-operatively was a clinical decision. Our data did not support additional testing in routine revision surgery for AF.", " Approximately a fifth of all total hip arthroplasty (THA) patients suffers from bilateral osteoarthritis of the hip. It is unclear whether mortality risks differ between simultaneous bilateral THA and staged bilateral THA. We investigated mortality after simultaneous THA compared with staged bilateral THA in the largest cohort hitherto reported. METHODS The 42,238 patients reported to have received bilateral primary THA from 1992 to 2012 in the Swedish Hip Arthroplasty Register were included. Tumours and fractures as underlying diagnoses were excluded. The time interval between the first and second THA was divided into four categories or treated as a continuous variable. Unadjusted survival was calculated according to Kaplan-Meier and adjusted Cox regression models were fitted in order to calculate crude and adjusted hazard ratios (HR) for the risk of death within different time frames. RESULTS Patients selected for simultaneous bilateral surgery were younger, more often male, and had lower ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) class than patients receiving staged procedures. The adjusted 90-day mortality after the second procedure did not differ between the four investigated groups (simultaneous bilateral [HR 1.3, CI 0.5-3.3], surgeries within 6 months [HR 1.1, CI 0.6-2.0], surgeries between 7 and 12 months [HR 0.7, CI 0.4-1.2], with second surgery after >12 months as the reference group). For patients older than 75 years, men, patients with ASA class 3 or above, and for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) the 90-day mortality was increased. The unadjusted risk of implant revision of any hip was slightly higher for patients with simultaneous bilateral THA compared to those with staged procedure within one year, but after adjustment for age, gender, diagnosis and implant fixation these differences were no longer statistically significant. CONCLUSION There were no clinically relevant differences in early postoperative mortality between simultaneous and staged bilateral surgery in healthy patients. Advanced age, RA, a high ASA class and male sex increased the risk of death within 90 days. There may be an issue with enhanced risk of implant revision in patients with simultaneous bilateral THA that needs to be explored further.", " To analyze survival, neurologic injury, and kidney function after acute type A aortic dissection. METHODS A total of 445 patients undergoing surgery for acute type A aortic dissection were analyzed. Evaluation according to risk factors for mortality, neurologic injury, and kidney function was performed. RESULTS Overall 1-, 5-, and 10-year survival rates were 82.8 \u00b1 1.8%, 73.6 \u00b1 2.4%, and 59.3 \u00b1 3.9, respectively. Independent preoperative risk factors for mortality were preexisting renal impairment (p = 0.001), reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (p < 0.001), and age (p < 0.001). Perioperative risk factors were prolonged cross-clamp (p < 0.001) and cerebral perfusion time (p = 0.001). Risk factors for renal failure were preexisting renal impairment (p < 0.001), prolonged cross-clamp time (p < 0.001), cerebral perfusion time (p < 0.001), and age (p = 0.022). Risk factors for neurologic injury were cross-clamp time (p = 0.038), cerebral perfusion time (p = 0.007), and age (p = 0.045). CONCLUSION In addition to classic risk factors, survival after type A aortic dissection is affected by preexisting renal impairment. Preexisting renal impairment is predictive of postoperative renal failure. Therefore treatment and prevention strategies for renal failure during the acute and long-term course after acute type A aortic dissection are warranted.", "Diaphragmatic plication has been a well employed method for the treatment of diaphragmatic eventration and/or paralysis. Uniportal thoracoscopic procedures seem to offer substantial benefit in terms of postoperative pain and cosmesis with similar outcomes as other surgical techniques. A 60-year-old female patient was referred to our clinic for the surgical treatment of diaphragmatic eventration of an unknown cause. The patient was referred to our institution from another hospital, where she had undergone a femoro-popliteal and crural bypass which was unsuccessful, requiring amputation of her leg. Following surgery, she was unable to breath spontaneously without any specific reason. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging showed no pathology and the neurologists did not have a diagnosis for her comatose state. There was consensus in both hospitals that surgical plication of her elevated diaphragm might be the only option for respiratory improvement. We performed a double-lined diaphragmatic plication procedure by means of uniportal video-assisted thoracic surgery technique with CO2 insufflation using GelPort. Despite the time-consuming adhesiolysis and the need for lung suturing at the end of the procedure, the operative time was 120 min. Oxygenation remarkably improved after the operation, yet the patient remained in comatose state. She was referred back to the hospital where she had initially begun her therapy for further recovery.", "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 infections has led to substantial unmet need for treatments, many of which will require testing in appropriate animal models of this disease. Vaccine trials are already underway, but there remains an urgent need to find other therapeutic approaches to either target SARS-CoV-2 or the complications arising from viral infection, particularly the dysregulated immune response and systemic complications which have been associated with progression to severe COVID-19. At the time of writing, in vivo studies of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been described using macaques, cats, ferrets, hamsters, and transgenic mice expressing human angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). These infection models have already been useful for studies of transmission and immunity, but to date only partially model the mechanisms implicated in human severe COVID-19. There is therefore an urgent need for development of animal models for improved evaluation of efficacy of drugs identified as having potential in the treatment of severe COVID-19. These models need to recapitulate key mechanisms of COVID-19 severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and reproduce the immunopathology and systemic sequelae associated with this disease. Here, we review the current models of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related disease mechanisms and suggest ways in which animal models can be adapted to increase their usefulness in research into COVID-19 pathogenesis and for assessing potential treatments.", "Implantable long-term central venous port systems (CVPS) are widely used as a permanent means of accessing the vascular system for intravenous delivery of drugs, parenteral nutrition, blood transfusion, and blood sampling. These systems allow easy and repetitive puncture without causing much damage to the vessels. However, the body foreign surface of CVPS induces an inflammatory response with varying intensity (depending on the implant materials) that leads to formation of a fibrous tissue capsule around the implant. This study was designed to investigate the influence of bacterial infection on the tissue reaction induced by implanted CVPS in adult patients. 20 patients (9 women, 11 men, 58 \u00b1 14 yrs of age) were included in this study. These patients received explantation of a polysulfone based CVPS (ChemoSite\u2122, Covidien, Mansfield, USA) due to port related infections (patients with bacterial infections at the implantation site: group A, 5 men, 1 women) or to other reasons such as termination of treatment, thrombosis, or CVPS dysfunction (patients without bacterial infections, group B, 6 men, 8 women) 299.9 \u00b1 261.2 days after CVPS implantation. A sample of the encapsulating tissue covering the CVPS together with surrounding tissue (at least 1 \u00d7 1 cm2) was placed in a small container with fixing agent, a buffered neutral 4% formalin solution (pH 7). Histological sections of the samples were prepared for light microscopic analysis after paraffin embedding. Sections of 3 \u03bcm were cut and stained with haematoxylin and eosin, Weigert's elastic stain, and Heidenhain's azan stain. There was no difference in thickness, collagen and elastin content, or cell and capillary density of the fibrous capsule between both groups. Due to the wound healing reaction involving angiogenesis and fibroblast activation cell density and number of capillaries in the capsule tissue of all patients showed a positive correlation (r = 0.45, p < 0.05). However, the study demonstrated that at the end of the foreign body reaction the artificial tissue layer which covers the CVPS after implantation due to foreign body reaction shows only low reactivity towards infections.", "IMPORTANCE Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stents is currently the most commonly performed coronary revascularization procedure; hence, optimizing post-PCI outcomes is important for all physicians treating such patients. OBJECTIVE To review the contemporary literature on optimal medical therapy after PCI. EVIDENCE REVIEW We performed a comprehensive search of the PubMed and Cochrane Library databases for manuscripts on medical therapy after PCI, published between 2000 and February 2013. Bibliographies of the retrieved studies were searched by hand for other relevant studies. Priority was given to data from large randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses. Of the 6852 publications retrieved, 91 were included. FINDINGS Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor (eg, ticlopidine, clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor) reduces the risk of stent thrombosis and subsequent cardiovascular events post-PCI (number needed to treat, 33-53) and is the current standard of care. Aspirin should be continued indefinitely and low dose (75-100 mg daily) is preferred over higher doses. A P2Y12 inhibitor should be administered for 12 months after PCI, unless the patient is at high risk for bleeding; however, ongoing studies are assessing the value of shorter or longer duration of P2Y12 inhibitor administration. In patients with acute coronary syndromes, prasugrel and ticagrelor further reduce cardiovascular ischemic events compared with clopidogrel but are associated with higher bleeding risk. If possible, noncardiac surgery should be delayed until 12 months after coronary stenting. Patients receiving coronary stents who require warfarin are at high risk for bleeding if they also receive dual antiplatelet therapy. Omission of aspirin may be advantageous in such patients. Routine platelet function or genetic testing is currently not recommended to tailor antiplatelet therapy after PCI. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Dual antiplatelet therapy remains the cornerstone of medical therapy after PCI. Continuous advances in pharmacotherapy can further enhance our capacity to improve outcomes in this high-risk patient group.", "Current anti-VEGF therapies for colorectal cancer (CRC) provide limited survival benefit, as tumors rapidly develop resistance to these agents. Here, we have uncovered an immunosuppressive role for nonclassical Ly6Clo monocytes that mediates resistance to anti-VEGFR2 treatment. We found that the chemokine CX3CL1 was upregulated in both human and murine tumors following VEGF signaling blockade, resulting in recruitment of CX3CR1+Ly6Clo monocytes into the tumor. We also found that treatment with VEGFA reduced expression of CX3CL1 in endothelial cells in vitro. Intravital microscopy revealed that CX3CR1 is critical for Ly6Clo monocyte transmigration across the endothelium in murine CRC tumors. Moreover, Ly6Clo monocytes recruit Ly6G+ neutrophils via CXCL5 and produce IL-10, which inhibits adaptive immunity. Preventing Ly6Clo monocyte or Ly6G+ neutrophil infiltration into tumors enhanced inhibition of tumor growth with anti-VEGFR2 therapy. Furthermore, a gene therapy using a nanoparticle formulated with an siRNA against CX3CL1 reduced Ly6Clo monocyte recruitment and improved outcome of anti-VEGFR2 therapy in mouse CRCs. Our study unveils an immunosuppressive function of Ly6Clo monocytes that, to our knowledge, has yet to be reported in any context. We also reveal molecular mechanisms underlying antiangiogenic treatment resistance, suggesting potential immunomodulatory strategies to enhance the long-term clinical outcome of anti-VEGF therapies.", " Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banded plication (LAGBP) is a novel bariatric procedure, and little is known about its potential complications. OBJECTIVES Herein, we report on complications of LAGBP and discuss the clinical features and diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in such situations, with emphasis on gastric fold herniation (GFH). SETTING University Hospital. METHODS Prospectively collected data of 223 patients who underwent LAGBP for morbid obesity between August 2009 and December 2014 were retrospectively analyzed. Follow-up at 1 year was 75%. RESULTS Eight patients (3.5%) required readmission due to major complications, including 1 trocar site hernia, 1 band leak, 1 gastric stenosis, and 5 GFHs. GFHs occurred mostly in the first postoperative month (4/5, 80%) and at the fundus (5/5, 100%); 4 GFHs occurred in the initial 70 patients. Seven laparoscopic reoperations were required for managing GFH. The gastric band was removed in 3 patients (of 5; 60%). Two patients developed residual intra-abdominal abscess and were treated successfully by image-guided drainage. In March 2012, we reversed the order of our surgical techniques for the subsequent 153 patients and performed greater curvature plication first, followed by band placement. Only one GFH occurred after this change in surgical order (1/153 versus 4/70; P< .05). CONCLUSIONS High clinical suspicion assisted by radiological investigations and early surgical intervention is the key for managing GFH after LAGBP. Though GFH complications were rare, we significantly reduced its occurrence by altering the surgical order in LAGBP to plication followed by banding.", " The standard treatment of rectovaginal deep infiltrating endometriosis nodules (RVDIEN) consists in their surgical removal. RVDIEN are anatomically neovascularized. Indocyanine green (ICG) reveals vascularized structures when becoming fluorescent after exposure to near-infrared (NIR) light. This study aims to evaluate if fluorescence-guided surgery can improve the laparoscopic resection of RVDIEN, thus avoiding a rectal perforation. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients with a symptomatic RVDIEN, scheduled for a laparoscopic rectal shaving, were enrolled in the study. Technically, the RVDIEN was targeted and removed with the help of the NIR imager device Image 1 Spies (Karl Storz GmBH & Co KG, Tuttlingen, Germany) or Visera Elite II (Olympus Europe SE & Co KG, Hamburg, Germany), after an intraoperative, intravenous injection of ICG (0.25 mg/kg). RESULTS Six patients underwent a fluorescence-guided laparoscopic shaving procedure for the treatment of a nonobstructive RVDIEN. Fluorescence of the RVDIEN was observed in all the patients. In one patient, once the main lesion was removed, the posterior vaginal fornix still appeared fluorescent and was removed. No intraoperative rectal perforation occurred. The postoperative hospital stay was 2 days. No postoperative rectovaginal fistula occurred within a median follow-up of 16 months (range = 2-23 months). CONCLUSION In this preliminary study, fluorescence-guided laparoscopy appeared to help in separating the RVDIEN from the healthy rectal tissue, without rectal perforation. Moreover, this technique was helpful in deciding if the resection needed to be enlarged to the posterior vaginal fornix.", "Treatable diseases continue to exact a heavy burden worldwide despite powerful advances in treatment. Diagnostics play crucial roles in the detection, management, and ultimate prevention of these diseases by guiding the allocation of precious medical resources. Motivated by globalization and evolving disease, and enabled by advances in molecular pathology, the scientific community has produced an explosion of research on miniaturized integrated biosensor platforms for disease detection. Low-cost, automated tests promise accessibility in low-resource settings by loosening constraints around infrastructure and usability. To address the challenges raised by invasive and intrusive sample collection, researchers are exploring alternative biomarkers in various specimens. Specifically, patient-generated airborne biomarkers suit minimally invasive collection and automated analysis. Disease biomarkers are known to exist in aerosols and volatile compounds in breath, odor, and headspace, media that can be exploited for field-ready diagnostics. This article reviews global disease priorities and the characteristics of low-resource settings. It surveys existing technologies for the analysis of bioaerosols and volatile organic compounds, and emerging technologies that could enable their translation to the point of care. Engineering advances promise to enable appropriate diagnostics by detecting chemical and microbial markers. Nonetheless, further innovation and cost reduction are needed for these technologies to broadly affect global health.", "Laparoscopic splenectomy is now established as a safe and feasible procedure. However, it remains associated with some short- and long-term postoperative complications, especially infectious complications. To our knowledge, this is the first report (with video) focusing on the safety and feasibility of laparoscopic hemi-splenectomy and its surgical outcomes for the treatment of splenic abscesses causing septic emboli. This technique combines the immunological benefits of partial splenectomy and the postoperative benefits of a minimally invasive approach. Further studies are needed to standardize this technique and to assess its immunological and surgical benefits.", " Carotid cavernous fistulae (CCFs) are most commonly classified based on arterial supply. Symptomatology and treatment approach, however, are largely influenced by venous drainage. OBJECTIVE To propose an updated classification system using venous drainage. METHODS CCFs with posterior/inferior drainage only, posterior/inferior and anterior drainage, anterior drainage only, and retrograde drainage into cortical veins with/without other drainage channels were designated as types 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. CCFs involving a direct connection between the internal carotid artery and cavernous sinus were designated as type 5. This system was retrospectively applied to 29 CCF patients. RESULTS Our proposed classification was significantly associated with symptomatology (P < .001). Type 2 was significantly associated with coexisting ocular/orbital and cavernous symptoms only (P < .001), type 3 with ocular/orbital symptoms only (P < .01), and type 4 demonstrated cortical symptoms with/without ocular/orbital and cavernous symptoms (P < .01), respectively. There was a significant association of our classification system with the endovascular treatment approach (P < .001). Types 1 and 2 were significantly associated with endovascular treatment through the inferior petrosal sinus (P < .01). Type 3 was significantly associated with endovascular treatment through the ophthalmic vein (P < .01) and type 5 with transarterial approach (P < .01), respectively. Types 2 (27.6%) and 3 (34.5%) were most prevalent in this series, whereas type 1 was rare (6.9%), suggesting that some degree of thrombosis is present, with implications for spontaneous resolution. Type 2 CCFs demonstrated a trend toward partial resolution after endovascular treatment (P = .07). CONCLUSION Our proposed classification system is easily applicable in clinical practice and demonstrates correlation with symptomatology, treatment approach, and outcome.", "OBJECTIVE To review the literature on the surgical and nonsurgical treatment options for stress urinary incontinence in women, focusing exclusively on randomized clinical trials and high quality meta-analyses. MATERIALS AND METHODS A computer-aided and manual search for published randomized controlled trials and high quality meta-analyses investigating both conservative and surgical treatment options for stress urinary incontinence. In the case of a treatment that is not studied in these formats large case series have been used. RESULTS Articles were reviewed and the results summarized on pelvic floor physical therapy, pharmacotherapy, bulking agents, and surgery (open and minimally invasive). CONCLUSION There are numerous high quality studies in the literature. It can be difficult to make definitive conclusions on the most appropriate treatment options due to the variability in the outcomes used to define success in these articles. There is also a dire lack of studies evaluating and comparing the surgical options for patients with intrinsic sphincter deficiency.", "CONCLUSION Patients with risk factors including younger age, mastoiditis, external ear disease, treatment by older surgeons, and concomitant mastoidectomy should receive detailed management to minimize the probability of re-operation for chronic otitis media (COM). OBJECTIVES Although COM remains a common ear disease requiring surgical intervention, its re-operation risks are less well-documented. This study aimed to compare patients with COM who underwent re-operation and those patients with no re-operation, and identify the risks of re-operation. METHOD This retrospective cohort study analyzed the trend of COM surgery from 1999-2009, and identified the re-operation risks of 18 895 patients with COM who underwent surgery from 2002-2006 using the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. RESULTS Among the study population, 129 patients underwent revision surgery during a 5.5 \u00b1 1.5 year follow-up period. A univariate logistic regression analysis showed that the re-operation rate was significantly higher in patients under 18 years of age, those with mastoiditis, disorders of external ear, treatment by surgeons of 50-64 years of age, use of a very high volume surgeon, and combined surgery with mastoidectomy. A multivariate analysis further limited the re-operation risk factors to younger patients, those with mastoiditis, external ear disorders, treatment by older surgeons, and concomitant mastoidectomy.", ": Diffuse alveolar haemorrhage (DAH) is a serious pulmonary complication characterised by a high mortality rate and the absence of specific treatment. The intrapulmonary administration of activated recombinant factor VII (rFVIIa) in DAH was recently published in six patients by Heslet et al with an efficient hemostatic effect. We describe two cases of DAH treated with intrapulmonary rFVIIa. METHODS: Two cases of DAH were admitted to the ICU after presenting abrupt desaturation, tachypnea, cough and haemoptysis, requiring orotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. The diagnosis was achieved by the bloody return during the bronchoalveolar lavage, during the procedure rFVIIa (50 \u03bcg/Kg in 50 ml of isotonic saline) was administered via the bronchoscope. RESULTS: Immediate cessation of bleeding was observed. Prior to intrapulmonary administration of rFVIIa, the FiO(2 )was 1, which was reduced to 0.4 24 hours later. Following the procedure, the haemostatic effect made blood transfusion superfluous. No thrombotic complications associated with administration of the drug were observed. After the intervention both cases progressed fast and was discharged from the ICU with no further episodes of bleeding. CONCLUSION: 1. Local intrabronchial deposition of DAH with rFVIIa has been shown to be effective in controlling life-threatening DAH. 2. In the case described above, no thrombotic complications were observed following the intrapulmonary administration of rFVIIa.", "PURPOSE To retrospectively evaluate technical success, effectiveness, complications, patient survival, and prognostic factors with percutaneous radiofrequency (RF) ablation for pulmonary metastases resulting from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). MATERIALS AND METHODS Thirty-two patients from six institutions were included, with a total of 83 pulmonary metastases treated in 65 sessions. RF ablation was always performed percutaneously with computed tomography (CT) guidance. Primary endpoints were technical success and technique effectiveness. Technique effectiveness was evaluated based on sequential follow-up CT images. Secondary study endpoints were complications, patient survival, and determination of prognostic factors. Complications were classified as major or minor. Prognostic factors were determined by analyzing multiple variables with the log-rank test. RESULTS Technical success rate was 100%. Primary technique effectiveness rates were 92% each at 1, 2, and 3 years. Major and minor complications occurred after 16 (25%) and 23 (35%) of the 65 sessions, respectively. The median follow-up period was 20.5 months. Overall survival rates were 87% at 1 year and 57% each at 2 and 3 years (median and mean survival times, 37.7 mo and 43.2 mo, respectively). Significantly better survival rates were obtained in cases of (i) no viable intrahepatic recurrence (P < .001), (ii) Child-Pugh class A disease (P < .001), (iii) absence of liver cirrhosis (P < .001), (iv) absence of hepatitis C virus infection (P = .006), and (v) \u03b1-fetoprotein level of 10 ng/mL or lower (P = .007) at the time of RF ablation. CONCLUSIONS RF ablation appears effective, with an acceptable safety profile, in selected patients with pulmonary metastases resulting from HCC.", "Ginkgolic acids (GA) are alkylphenol constituents of the leaves and fruits of Ginkgo biloba. GA has shown pleiotropic effects in vitro, including: antitumor effects through inhibition of lipogenesis; decreased expression of invasion associated proteins through AMPK activation; and potential rescue of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) induced synaptic impairment. GA was also reported to have activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Several mechanisms for this activity have been suggested including: SUMOylation inhibition; blocking formation of the E1-SUMO intermediate; inhibition of fatty acid synthase; non-specific SIRT inhibition; and activation of protein phosphatase type-2C. Here we report that GA inhibits Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) by inhibition of both fusion and viral protein synthesis. Additionally, we report that GA inhibits human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) genome replication and Zika virus (ZIKV) infection of normal human astrocytes (NHA). We show a broad spectrum of fusion inhibition by GA of all three classes of fusion proteins including HIV, Ebola virus (EBOV), influenza A virus (IAV) and Epstein Barr virus (EBV). In addition, we show inhibition of a non-enveloped adenovirus. Our experiments suggest that GA inhibits virion entry by blocking the initial fusion event. Data showing inhibition of HSV-1 and CMV replication, when GA is administered post-infection, suggest a possible secondary mechanism targeting protein and DNA synthesis. Thus, in light of the strong effect of GA on viral infection, even after the infection begins, it may potentially be used to treat acute infections (e.g. Coronavirus, EBOV, ZIKV, IAV and measles), and also topically for the successful treatment of active lesions (e.g. HSV-1, HSV-2 and varicella-zoster virus (VZV)).", "Breast cancer patients presenting with symptomatic brain metastases have poor prognosis, and current chemotherapeutic agents are largely ineffective. In this study, we evaluated the hypomethylating agent azacitidine (AZA) for its potential as a novel therapeutic in preclinical models of brain metastasis of breast cancer. We used the parental triple-negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 (231) cells and their brain colonizing counterpart (231Br) to ascertain phenotypic differences in response to AZA. We observed that 231Br cells have higher metastatic potential compared to 231 cells. With regard to therapeutic value, the AZA IC50 value in 231Br cells is significantly lower than that in parental cells (P < .01). AZA treatment increased apoptosis and inhibited the Wnt signaling transduction pathway, angiogenesis, and cell metastatic capacity to a significantly higher extent in the 231Br line. AZA treatment in mice with experimental brain metastases significantly reduced tumor burden (P = .0112) and increased survival (P = .0026) compared to vehicle. Lastly, we observed a decreased expression of keratin 18 (an epithelial maker) in 231Br cells due to hypermethylation, elucidating a potential mechanism of action of AZA in treating brain metastases from breast cancer.", "Continuous addition of undesired effluents to the environment affects foliar surface of leaf, changes their morphology, stomata, photosynthetic pigments, and biochemical constituents which result in massive damage due to persistent nature of the pollutant. In persistent hostile environment, plants fail to grow and develop, and the effects are often extensive. In current study, landscape plants were exposed to different levels of road dust to analyze the effect on various photosynthetic pigments. Dry roadside sediments were collected through a vacuum pump and passed through filters to get fine particles less than 100 \u03bcm and sprinkled on Euphorbia milii (EM), Gardenia jasminoides (GJ), and Hibiscus rosa-sinensis (HRs) by using a hand pump, twice daily at T1 (control), T2, T3, and T4 (0, 2, 4, and 6 g/plant, respectively) for a period of 3 months in green house. Road sediment significantly reduces leaf pigments in landscape plants population and the effects were more severe in high level of dust deposition. Individual response of EM, GJ, and HRs to different levels of road dust was variable; however, road sediment significantly reduces leaf pigments at high dose of roadside dust deposition. EM plants exposed to 2 g/plant roadside dust showed higher chlorophyll-a, chlorophyll-b, total chlorophyll, chlorophyllide-b, and polar carotenoid contents as compared to GJ and HRs. Leaf chlorophyll-a, chlorophyll-b, total chlorophyll, carotenoid, and polar carotenoid contents of EM were higher than GJ and HRs in T3 and T4 treatments. However HRs showed significantly higher protochlorophyllide, chlorophyllide-a, and pheophytin-b contents of leaf in T4 group. EM was found as tolerant landscape plant followed by HRs. GJ was most vulnerable to road dust stress. Present study concludes that the entire biosynthesis of leaf pigments is in chain and interlinked together where effect of road dust on one pigment influences other pigments and their derivatives. Salient features of the present study provide useful evidence to estimate roadside dust as a major risk factor for plant pigments, and plants in green belt along roadside suffer retarded growth and fail to establish and develop.", " Laparoscopic gastric devascularization of the upper stomach in patients with gastric varices has rarely been reported. Perioperative clinical data were compared with patients who underwent open surgery. PRESENTATION OF CASES From 2009 to 2012, we performed laparoscopic gastric devascularization without splenectomy for the treatment of gastric varices in eight patients. The patients included four males and four females. Peri-gastric vessels were divided using electrical coagulating devices or other devices according to the diameter of the vessels. Two patients underwent conversion to open surgery due to intraoperative bleeding. DISCUSSION Intraoperative blood loss in patients who accomplished laparoscopic devascularization was very small (mean 76ml). However, once bleeding occurs, there is a risk of causing massive bleeding. CONCLUSION With further improvement of laparoscopic devices, laparoscopic gastric devascularization without splenectomy must be an effective and less-invasive surgical procedure in the treatment of gastric varices.", " Stroke is a growing global epidemic limiting the ability of millions to function independently due to post-stroke deficits and complications. Although specialized stroke rehabilitation improves the recovery of functional abilities, accessing rehabilitation services has become increasingly challenging as the number of stroke survivors continues to increase and rehabilitation resources remain scarce. Mobile tablet-based therapies (MTBTs) may be a resource-efficient platform for providing stroke rehabilitation services. The feasibility and challenges of offering MTBTs to stroke survivors should be well understood before expensive, large-scale clinical trials are undertaken to study treatment efficacy. METHOD A systematic scoping review will be conducted to describe attempted MTBTs following stroke and the challenges encountered by survivors and study staff. Studies of interest will evaluate MTBTs offered to adult stroke patients in response to post-stroke complications or deficits. Journal databases, gray literature sources, clinical trial registries, relevant organizational websites, and reference lists of eligible studies will be searched to identify suitable studies. Study characteristics, barriers to care, methodological challenges, patient-reported outcomes, and health outcomes will be extracted to describe MTBTs and understand the challenges encountered in context. Results will be presented using descriptive statistics, tables, figures, and narrative description to summarize the scope of the field. DISCUSSION Trends in MTBT feasibility and common challenges will be discussed to summarize major findings and highlight research gaps. Solutions to common challenges experienced by intervention participants and study staff will be proposed. Implications for the conduct of randomized clinical trials of MTBT efficacy and the appropriateness of a systematic review and meta-analysis of completed trials will be discussed.

Accurate and rapid recognition of associated life-threatening conditions is paramount for timely treatment. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) has been shown to impact the diagnosis of dyspnea presentations in resource-rich settings, and may be of greater diagnostic benefit in resource-limited settings. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled a convenience sample of 100 patients presenting with dyspnea in the Emergency Department at University Teaching Hospital of Kigali (UTH-K) in Rwanda. After a traditional history and physical exam, the primary treating team listed their 3 main diagnoses and ranked their confidence accuracy in the leading diagnosis on a Likert scale (1\u20135). Multi-organ ultrasound scans performed by a separate physician sonographer assessed the heart, lungs, inferior vena cava, and evaluated for lower extremity deep vein thrombosis or features of disseminated tuberculosis. The sonographer reviewed the findings with the treating team, who then listed 3 diagnoses post-ultrasound and ranked their confidence accuracy in the leading diagnosis on a Likert scale (1\u20135). The hospital diagnosis at discharge was used as the standard in determining the accuracy of the pre- and post-ultrasound diagnoses. RESULTS: Of the 99 patients included in analysis, 57.6% (n = 57) were male, with a mean age of 45 years. Most of them had high-level acuity (54.5%), the dyspnea was of acute onset (45.5%) and they came from district hospitals (50.5%). The most frequent discharge diagnoses were acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) (26.3%) and pneumonia (21.2%). Ultrasound changed the leading diagnosis in 66% of cases. The diagnostic accuracy for ADHF increased from 53.8 to 100% (p = 0.0004), from 38 to 85.7% for pneumonia (p = 0.0015), from 14.2 to 85.7% for extrapulmonary tuberculosis (p = 0.0075), respectively, pre and post-ultrasound. The overall physician diagnostic accuracy increased from 34.7 to 88.8% pre and post- ultrasound. The clinician confidence in the leading diagnosis changed from a mean of 3.5 to a mean of 4.7 (Likert scale 0\u20135) (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In dyspneic patients presenting to this Emergency Department, ultrasound frequently changed the leading diagnosis, significantly increased clinicians\u2019 confidence in the leading diagnoses, and improved diagnostic accuracy.", "As a syndrome of injurious pulmonary inflammation resulting in deranged respiratory physiology, acute lung injury affords numerous potential therapeutic targets. Two main pharmacological treatment strategies have arisen-the attempted inhibition of excessive inflammation or the manipulation of the resulting physiological derangement causing respiratory failure. Additionally, such interventions may allow the delivery of less injurious mechanical ventilation. An emerging approach is the use of cell-based therapy, which, rather than inhibiting the inflammatory process, seeks to convert it from an injurious process to a reparative one. This review outlines previous, current, and emerging pharmacological therapies for acute lung injury.", "OBJECTIVE To assess the efficacy of linezolid compared with vancomycin in an experimental model of pneumonia induced by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in ventilated pigs. METHODS Forty pigs (30 kg) were intubated and challenged via bronchoscopy with a suspension of 106 colony forming units of MRSA into every lobe. Afterwards, pigs were ventilated up to 96 hours. Twelve hours after bacterial inoculation, the animals were randomized into 4 groups of treatment: group 1, control; group 2, vancomycin twice daily; group 3, continuous infusion of vancomycin; and group 4, linezolid. Clinical and laboratory parameters were monitored throughout the study. Bacterial cultures of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung tissue samples were performed at the end of the study. Measurements of histopathology derangements of lung samples and studies of intrapulmonary drug penetration were performed. RESULTS A total of 34 animals completed the study. No differences in clinical and laboratory parameters were observed. The percentage of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung tissue samples with positive cultures for MRSA in controls and groups 2, 3, and 4 was respectively 75%, 11%, 11%, and 0% (p < .01); 52%, 9%, 24%, and 2.5% (p < .01). Histopathology studies demonstrated signs of pneumonia in 95%, 69%, 58%, and 57% and signs of severe pneumonia in 48%, 29%, 22%, and 0% of controls and groups 2, 3, and 4, respectively (p < .01). In addition, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics profile in serum and lung tissue showed better results for linezolid compared with both vancomycin treatments. CONCLUSIONS In this animal model of MRSA pneumonia, linezolid showed a better efficacy than vancomycin showed because of a better pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics index.", "Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is first-choice treatment for many patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms. Complications unique to endovascular treatment include endoleak and endotension, which can eventually lead to rupture. We present two cases of late aortic rupture after EVAR, where both patients had recent preceding catheter-directed thrombolysis with urokinase for acute limb ischemia. These cases suggest a relation between thrombolytic therapy and aortic rupture after EVAR, and we should therefore be aware of this possible complication.", "Systemic inflammation co-activates coagulation, which unchecked culminates in a lethal syndrome of multi-organ microvascular thrombosis known as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). We studied an endotoxin-induced inflammatory state in rats to identify biomarkers of hemostatic imbalance favoring hypercoagulability. Intraperitoneal injection of LPS at 15 mg/kg body weight resulted in peripheral leukopenia and widespread neutrophilic sequestration characteristic of an acute systemic inflammatory response. Early indicators of hemostatic pathway activation developed within 4 hours, including increased circulating concentrations of procoagulant extracellular vesicles (EVs), EVs expressing endothelial cell and platelet membrane markers, and high concentration of soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), and D-dimers. Inflammation persisted throughout the 48-hour observation period; however, increases were found in a subset of serum microRNA (miRNA) that coincided with gradual resolution of hemostatic protein abnormalities and reduction in EV counts. Dose-adjusted LPS treatment in rats provides a time-course model to develop biomarker profiles reflecting procoagulant imbalance and rebalance under inflammatory conditions.", "Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) causes significant disability and mortality. Current guidelines for CVT management support the initial use of unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin followed by longer-term oral vitamin K antagonist (VKA). There has been increasing, albeit limited, evidence for the use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) as an alternative to VKA. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that compared the safety and efficacy of DOACs to VKA in treating CVT. A comprehensive literature search was carried out in Medline, Embase and Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register using a suitable keyword/MeSH term search strategy. All studies published in English comparing outcomes of patients with CVT treated with DOAC or VKA were included. In total, 6 studies (5 observational studies and 1 randomized clinical trial) comprising 412 patients (age range 16-83 years) were analyzed. DOAC was used in 151 patients, while 261 received VKA. The follow-up period was 3-11 months. The efficacy of DOACs was comparable with VKA in terms of partial or full thrombus recanalization (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.89-1.16) and excellent functional recovery with modified Rankin scale < 2 (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.93-1.13). Patients treated with DOAC developed lower major bleeding events when compared to VKA, although this did not reach statistical significance (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.12-1.59). We provide preliminary evidence to support DOAC as effective and safe alternatives to VKA in CVT treatment. We await the results of upcoming randomized trials to further support our results and validate the use of DOAC.", " AND PURPOSE Endosaccular flow disruption is a recognized treatment options for treating both unruptured and ruptured aneurysms. The Contour device is designed to target the neck of an aneurysm and cause flow disruption within the aneurysm hence promoting thrombosis and neo-endothelialization at the neck. This article presents initial experiences with the Contour. METHODS The prospectively maintained database was retrospectively reviewed to identify patients treated with the Contour device. Demographic data, aneurysm characteristics, clinical result, and clinical and radiological follow-up information were recorded. RESULTS The review identified 3 patients (2 female), with 3 unruptured aneurysms, of average age 67 \u00b1 8.7 years (range 62-77 years). The aneurysms were all located in the anterior circulation including one pericallosal, one at the A1-2 junction and one on the ICA bifurcation. The mean average dome height was 7.6 \u00b1 0.62 mm (range 7.1-8.3 mm), dome width 5.7 \u00b1 2 mm (range 3.5-7.5 mm), and neck width 3.6 \u00b1 0.95 mm (range 2.5-4.2 mm). At follow-up angiography two of the aneurysms were completely occluded and one device had displaced into the aneurysm sac due to inappropriate positioning of the device. Of the patients one had minor stroke during the postoperative period but returned to baseline neurology. All patients were mRS 0 at last follow-up. CONCLUSION The Contour is a promising new aneurysm occlusion device. Further studies with longer term follow-up are required to determine the efficacy of this novel device.", "AIMS This study evaluated the safety, feasibility, and short-term outcomes of laparoscopic extralevator abdominoperineal excision (laparoscopic-ELAPE) with primary suturing for low rectal cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS Consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic-ELAPE with primary suturing for low rectal cancer at our institution between September 2013 and January 2015 were retrospectively identified from a prospectively maintained database. Short-term outcomes, including intraoperative complications, postoperative morbidity, and oncologic adequacy of surgical specimens, were evaluated. RESULTS Laparoscopic-ELAPE was successful in all 33 included patients, with no patient requiring conversion to an open approach. Mean operation time was 200 minutes, and mean intraoperative blood loss was 90 mL. Except for bowel perforation in 2 patients (6.1%), there were no intraoperative complications. Two patients (6.1%) had positive circumferential resection margins. Median length of hospital stay was 7 days. The 30-day morbidity and mortality rates were 15.2% and 0%, respectively. Postoperative complications within 30 postoperative days included perineal wound infection (2 patients, 6.1%), respiratory infection (2 patients, 6.1%), and chylous fistula (1 patient, 3.0%). Complications at a median follow-up time of 12 months (range, 3-19 months) included local tumor recurrence (1 patient, 3.0%), perineal dehiscence (2 patients, 6.1%), perineal seroma (1 patient, 3.0%), bowel obstruction (1 patient, 3.0%), urinary retention (2 patients, 6.1%), and chronic perineal pain (2 patients, 6.1%). There were no instances of perineal hernia, persistent sinus, or peristomal hernia. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic-ELAPE with primary suturing appears to be a feasible and safe treatment approach for low rectal cancer, with acceptable short-term outcomes.", " Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOAC) are equally or potentially superior in terms of effectiveness in the prevention of ischemic stroke and carry a lower associated risk of intracranial hemorrhage compared to Vitamin K antagonists. Nevertheless, ischemic strokes also occur in patients who are being treated with NOAC. In those particular patients, knowledge about the underlying stroke etiology, clinical presentation, acute management, and complication rates is scarce. OBJECTIVE Systematic literature review to provide a comprehensive clinical overview in terms of presentation, laboratory, imaging parameters and outcomes of patients suffering from acute cerebral ischemic events (i.e. TIA and acute ischemic stroke) while on treatment with a NOAC. Only if available, comparison to VKA is presented which was not the primary focus of this analysis. DATA SOURCES PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus and EMBASE from January 1, 2006, to November 20, 2018. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA 52 studies providing detailed information on a total of 12247 patients were included. We excluded case reports and case series with less than five patients. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHOD We systematically assessed study quality using a bias tool and pooled consistent data. RESULTS Existing data indicates milder stroke severity and smaller infarct size of acute ischemic stroke on treatment with NOAC compared to stroke occurrence on Vitamin K antagonists (VKA). Established risk factors for ischemic events also play a role in stroke while on NOACs, albeit the underlying etiology remains poorly understood. Intravenous thrombolysis and endovascular therapy seem to be safe and effective, but patient selection for recanalization therapies is challenging. LIMITATIONS Limited quality of published data, duplicate cases, statistical issues of data pooling, possible incomplete retrieval of identified research and reporting bias might have limited our findings. CONCLUSIONS Acute ischemic events despite treatment with NOAC therapy are insufficiently investigated. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION NUMBER PROSPERO: CRD42018074853.", "AIMS In acute ischaemic stroke, endovascular therapy with the Solitaire FR stent retriever has been shown to double recanalisation rates and the numbers of patients who recover to be functionally independent, when compared to standard therapy. We present the Auckland City Hospital experience of clot retrieval. METHODS Previously independent ischaemic stroke patients with contraindications to, or no response following, i.v. alteplase, were treated with clot retrieval. All patients had proximal large artery occlusions on CT angiography and many also had CT perfusion scans showing salvageable ischaemic tissue. RESULTS Clot retrieval was performed in 33 patients (10 women, mean (SD) age of 54 (17) years) since 2011. Twenty-two (67%) patients were first treated with alteplase. Patients fell into three groups: 17 (52%) had anterior circulation occlusion, similar to those in recent clot retrieval studies; 10 (30%) had posterior circulation occlusion; and six (18%) had 'Rescue' clot retrieval, usually with stroke that followed a procedure. Patients with anterior circulation occlusion had a median time from symptom onset to groin puncture of 225 (range 95-450) minutes, full recanalisation occurred in 76%, and by day 90, all 17 were alive and living at home, with 63% functionally independent (modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 0-2). At day 90, eight of 10 posterior circulation occlusion group patients were alive and living at home, four with a mRS of 0-2. In contrast, four of six 'Rescue' patients had died, and another was functionally dependent with a mRS of 4. CONCLUSIONS Endovascular clot retrieval can be safely and effectively performed in a New Zealand setting with similar results to recent trials in anterior circulation occlusion patients. We suggest that District Health Boards develop clot retrieval services as part of regional hyperacute stroke treatment pathways.", "Introduction Transoral laser microsurgery (TLM) has established itself as an effective option in the management of malignant tumors of the glottis, supraglottis, and hypopharynx. Nonetheless, TLM is not a harmless technique. Complications such as bleeding, dyspnea, or ignition of the air may appear in this type of surgery. Objective The aim of this study is to describe the complications that occurred in a group of patients treated for glottic and supraglottic carcinomas in all stages by TLM. Methods This study is a retrospective analysis of patients diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the glottis and supraglottis for all stages (T1, T2, T3, T4), N -/ + , M -/+ treated with TLM between January 2009 and March 2012 in a tertiary hospital. Results Ninety-eight patients met the inclusion criteria, which had undergone a total of 131 interventions. Ninety-four (95.9%) patients were male and 4 (4.1%) were female. The mean age was 64.2 years (\u00b1 10.7 years = min 45; max 88). The presence of intraoperative complications was low, affecting only 2% of patients. Immediate postoperative complications occurred in 6.1%, whereas delayed complications affected 13.2% of patients, without any of them being fatal. Conclusion TLM has shown good oncologic results and low complication rate compared with traditional open surgery during intervention, in the immediate and delayed postoperative period and in the long-term with respect to radiotherapy.", " AND PURPOSE Internal carotid artery dissection is a common cause of stroke in young adults. It may be responsible for tandem occlusion defined by a cervical steno-occlusive carotid wall hematoma associated with an intracranial large-vessel stroke. Intravenous thrombolysis is associated with a poor clinical outcome in these cases, and endovascular treatment has not been specifically evaluated to date. Our aim was to evaluate endovascular treatment technical and clinical efficiency in this specific occlusion topography, in comparison with treatment of isolated anterior circulation stroke. MATERIALS AND METHODS As part of our ongoing prospective stroke data base started in August 2009 (Prognostic Factors Related to Clinical Outcome Following Thrombectomy in Ischemic Stroke [RECOST] Study), we analyzed all carotid artery dissection tandem occlusion strokes and isolated anterior circulation occlusions. All patients were selected for endovascular treatment according to clinical-radiologic mismatch, NIHSS \u2265 7 and DWI-ASPECTS \u22655, within 6 hours after onset. For carotid artery dissection, the revascularization procedure consisted first of distal recanalization by a stent retriever in the intracranial vessel. Following assessment of the circle of Willis, internal carotid artery stent placement was only performed in case of insufficiency. Carotid artery dissection treatment efficacy, safety, and clinical outcome were compared with the results of the isolated anterior circulation occlusion cohort. RESULTS Two hundred fifty-eight patients with an anterior circulation stroke were analyzed, including 57 with tandem occlusions (22%); among them, 20 were carotid artery dissection-related occlusions (7.6%). The median age of patients with tandem occlusions with internal carotid dissection was 52.45 versus 66.85 years for isolated anterior circulation occlusion (P < .05); the mean initial NIHSS score was 17.53 \u00b1 4.11 versus 17.55 \u00b1 4.8 (P = .983). The median DWI-ASPECTS was 6.05 versus 6.64 (P = .098), and the average time from onset to puncture was 4.38 for tandem occlusions versus 4.53 hours in isolated anterior circulation occlusion (P = .704). Complication rates and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage were comparable in both groups (5% versus 3%, P = .49). The duration of the procedure was significantly prolonged in case of tandem occlusion (80.69 versus 65.45 minutes, P = .030). Fourteen patients with carotid artery dissection (70%) had a 3-month mRS of \u2264 2, without a significant difference from patients with an isolated anterior circulation occlusion (44%, P = .2). Only 5 carotid artery dissections (25%) necessitated cervical stent placement. No early ipsilateral stroke recurrence was recorded, despite the absence of stent placement in 15 patients (75%) with carotid artery dissection. CONCLUSIONS Mechanical endovascular treatment of carotid artery dissection tandem occlusions is safe and effective compared with isolated anterior circulation occlusion stroke therapy. Hence, a more conservative approach with stent placement only in cases of circle of Willis insufficiency may be a reliable and safe strategy.", "Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) receptors that have been identified to date cannot fully explain the pathogenesis of EV-A71, which is an important global cause of hand, foot, and mouth disease and life-threatening encephalitis. We identified an IFN-\u03b3-inducible EV-A71 cellular entry factor, human tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (hWARS), using genome-wide RNAi library screening. The importance of hWARS in mediating virus entry and infectivity was confirmed by virus attachment, in vitro pulldown, antibody/antigen blocking, and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion. Hyperexpression and plasma membrane translocation of hWARS were observed in IFN-\u03b3-treated semipermissive (human neuronal NT2) and cDNA-transfected nonpermissive (mouse fibroblast L929) cells, resulting in their sensitization to EV-A71 infection. Our hWARS-transduced mouse infection model showed pathological changes similar to those seen in patients with severe EV-A71 infection. Expression of hWARS is also required for productive infection by other human enteroviruses, including the clinically important coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16) and EV-D68. This is the first report to our knowledge on the discovery of an entry factor, hWARS, that can be induced by IFN-\u03b3 for EV-A71 infection. Given that we detected high levels of IFN-\u03b3 in patients with severe EV-A71 infection, our findings extend the knowledge of the pathogenicity of EV-A71 in relation to entry factor expression upon IFN-\u03b3 stimulation and the therapeutic options for treating severe EV-A71-associated complications.", "OBJECTIVES To examine one health system's response to the essential care of its hip fracture population during the COVID-19 pandemic and report on its effect on patient outcomes. DESIGN Prospective cohort study SETTING:: Seven musculoskeletal care centers with New York City and Long Island. PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS 138 recent and 115 historical hip fracture patients. INTERVENTION Patients with hip fractures occurring between February 1, 2020 and April 15, 2020 or between February 1, 2019 and April 15, 2019 were prospectively enrolled in an orthopedic trauma registry and chart reviewed for demographic and hospital quality measures. Patients with recent hip fractures were identified as COVID positive (C+), COVID suspected (Cs) or COVID negative (C-). MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS Hospital quality measures, inpatient complications and mortality rates. RESULTS Seventeen (12.2%) patients were confirmed C+ by testing and another 14 (10.1%) were suspected (Cs) of having had the virus but were never tested. The C+ cohort, when compared to Cs and C- cohorts, had: an increased mortality rate (35.3% vs 7.1% vs 0.9%), increased length of hospital stay, a greater major complication rate and a greater incidence of ventilator need postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 had a devastating effect on the care of hip fracture patients during the pandemic. Although practice patterns generally remained unchanged, treating physicians need to understand the increased morbidity and mortality in hip fracture patients complicated by COVID-19. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Prognostic Level III. See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of Levels of Evidence.", "PURPOSE Clinically proven methods to prevent adhesion formation after flexor tendon repair have not yet been established. The aim of this pilot study was to assess the feasibility of amniotic membrane allograft as a mechanical barrier to decrease adhesion formation. METHODS Ten patients having flexor tendon injuries were planned to be recruited to the pilot study. The operative treatment consisted of tendon repair and fixation of amniotic membrane allograft around the repaired tendon. The primary outcome variable was the range of motion of the operated finger 6 months after the operation. Patients were monitored for infections and repair failures. RESULTS The study was terminated owing to unfavorable results after treatment of 5 patients. One patient had extensive stiffness and was subjected to tenolysis and joint release. Histopathological analysis of the tendon sheath revealed focal fibrosis. Another patient had a repair failure. The other 3 patients had fair to good results. CONCLUSIONS It seems improbable that the use of amniotic membrane allograft would yield clinically relevant improvement compared with the existing techniques. However, it remains unclear whether the unfavorable results are associated with technical factors, amniotic membrane allograft itself, or an irregular distribution of complications. TYPE OF STUDY/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Therapeutic V.", "Hatchery waste, an animal by-product of the poultry industry, needs sanitation treatment before further use as fertilizer or as a substrate in biogas or composting plants, owing to the potential presence of opportunistic pathogens, including zoonotic viruses. Effective sanitation is also important in viral epizootic outbreaks and as a routine, ensuring high hygiene standards on farms. This study examined the use of ammonia at different concentrations and temperatures to disinfect hatchery waste. Inactivation kinetics of high-pathogenic avian influenza virus H7N1 and low-pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N3, as representatives of notifiable avian viral diseases, were determined in spiked hatchery waste. Bovine parainfluenza virus type 3, feline coronavirus, and feline calicivirus were used as models for other important avian pathogens, such as Newcastle disease virus, infectious bronchitis virus, and avian hepatitis E virus. Bacteriophage MS2 was also monitored as a stable indicator. Coronavirus was the most sensitive virus, with decimal reduction (D) values of 1.2 and 0.63 h after addition of 0.5% (wt/wt) ammonia at 14 and 25\u00b0C, respectively. Under similar conditions, high-pathogenic avian influenza H7N1 was the most resistant, with D values of 3.0 and 1.4 h. MS2 was more resistant than the viruses to all treatments and proved to be a suitable indicator of viral inactivation. The results indicate that ammonia treatment of hatchery waste is efficient in inactivating enveloped and naked single-stranded RNA viruses. Based on the D values and confidence intervals obtained, guidelines for treatment were proposed, and one was successfully validated at full scale at a hatchery, with MS2 added to hatchery waste.", "PURPOSE A retrospective single-center review of ultrasound-guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA) treatment of colorectal cancer liver metastases was performed. This study reviews the primary and secondary technical effectiveness, overall survival of patients, recurrence-free survival, tumour-free survival, rates of local recurrence, and postprocedural RFA complications. Technical effectiveness and rates of complication with respect to tumour location and size were evaluated. Our results were compared with similar studies from Europe and North America. METHODS A total of 63 patients (109 tumours) treated with RFA between February 2004 and December 2009 were reviewed. Average and median follow-up time was 19.4 and 16.5 months, respectively (range, 1-54 months). Data from patient charts, pathology, and Picture Archiving and Communication System was integrated into an Excel database. Statistical Analysis Software was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS Primary and secondary technical effectiveness of percutaneous and intraoperative RFA were 90.8% and 92.7%, respectively. Average (SE) tumour-free survival was 14.4 \u00b1 1.4 months (range, 1-43 months), and average (SE) recurrence-free survival was 33.5 \u00b1 2.3 months (range, 2-50 months). Local recurrence was seen in 31.2% of treated tumours (range, 2-50 months) (34/109). Overall survival was 89.4% at 1 year, 70.0% at 2 years, and 38.1% at 3 years, with an average (SE) overall survival of 37.0 \u00b1 2.8 months. There were 14 postprocedural complications. There was no statistically significant difference in technical effectiveness for small tumours (1-2 cm) vs intermediate ones (3-5 cm). There was no difference in technical effectiveness for peripheral vs parenchymal tumours. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrated good-quality outcomes for RFA treatment of colorectal cancer liver metastases from a Canadian perspective and compared favorably with published studies.", "Summar y. The beginning of 2020 has seen the emergence of COVID-19, an outbreak caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, an important pathogen for humans. SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus containing 29891 nucleotides encoding 9889 amino acids. The genome is arranged as 5p-replicase (orf1/ab)-structural proteins [Spike (S) -Envelope (E) - Membrane (M) -Nucleocapsid (N)] -3. Viruses are obligate intracellular infectious agents that use the host cellular machinery to ensure their own fitness and survival. MicroRNAs (miRNA9) systems are potent post-transcriptional gene expression regulators that are important modulators of viral infections, and could play an important role in the treatment of viral infections. This review focuses to the genomic structure of coronaviruses, the functions of genomic proteins, the effects of micro RNA (miRNA) on virus replication and its pathogenesis.", "PURPOSE: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) in injured children is rare, but sequelae can be morbid and life-threatening. Recent trauma society guidelines suggesting that all children over 15 years old should receive thromboprophylaxis may result in overtreatment. We sought to evaluate the efficacy of a previously published VTE prediction algorithm and compare it to current recommendations. METHODS: Two institutional trauma registries were queried for all pediatric (age < 18 years) patients admitted from 2007 to 2018. Clinical data were applied to the algorithm and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve was calculated to test algorithm efficacy. RESULTS: A retrospective review identified 8271 patients with 30 episodes of VTE (0.36%). The VTE prediction algorithm classified 51 (0.6%) as high risk (> 5% risk), 322 (3.9%) as moderate risk (1\u20135% risk) and 7898 (95.5%) as low risk (< 1% risk). AUROC was 0.93 (95% CI 0.89\u20130.97). In our population, prophylaxis of the \u2018moderate-\u2019 and \u2018high-risk\u2019 cohorts would outperform the sensitivity (60% vs. 53%) and specificity (96% vs. 77%) of current guidelines while anticoagulating substantially fewer patients (373 vs. 1935, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: A VTE prediction algorithm using clinical variables can identify injured children at risk for venous thromboembolic disease with more discrimination than current guidelines. Prospective studies are needed to investigate the validity of this model. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III\u2014Clinical decision rule evaluated in a single population. ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL: The online version of this article (10.1007/s00383-019-04613-y) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.", " Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) is an established treatment for patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumours (NETs), although which factors are associated with an improved overall survival (OS) remains unclear. The primary aim of this study is to determine to what extent a radiological response to (90)Y-DOTATOC/(90)Y-DOTATATE PRRT is associated with an improved OS. The association of biochemical and clinical response to OS were assessed as secondary outcome measures. METHODS A retrospective analysis was conducted on 57 patients: radiological response was classified using RECIST criteria, biochemical response was classified using WHO criteria and clinical response was assessed subjectively. Responses were recorded as positive response (PR), stable disease (SD) or progressive disease (PD), and survival analysed. RESULTS Radiological response was achieved in 71.5% (24.5% PR, 47% SD) and was associated with a greater OS (51 and 56 months, respectively), compared with PD (18 months). A biochemical or clinical response post PRRT were not associated with a statistically significant improvement in OS. However, when combined with radiological response a survival benefit was observed according to the number of outcomes (radiological, biochemical, clinical), in which a response was observed. Mild haematological toxicity was common, renal toxicity was rare. CONCLUSION In patients with progressive metastatic NETs receiving (90)Y-DOTATOC/(90)Y-DOTATATE PRRT, a radiological response with either a PR or a SD post therapy confers a significant OS benefit.", "PURPOSE To investigate the respiratory motion of metal clips or surgical staples placed in the gastric wall for planning of radiation therapy in gastric cancer patients. METHODS This study examined 15 metal markers in the gastric walls of 12 patients with gastric cancer treated with external-beam photon RT. Motion assessment was analyzed in 41 respiratory phases covering 20 s acquired with computed tomography (CT) in the RT position using 320-multislice CT. The intra-fraction displacement was assessed in the cranio-caudal (CC), antero-posterior (AP), and right-left (RL) directions. RESULTS Motion in the CC direction showed a very strong correlation (R2 > 0.7) with the respiratory curve in all 15 markers. The mean (+/- SD) intra-fractional gastric motion (maximum range of displacement) was 12.5 (+/- 3.4) mm in the CC, 8.3 (+/- 2.2) mm in the AP, and 5.5 (+/- 3.0) mm in the RL direction. No significant differences in magnitude of motion were detected in the following: a) among the upper (n = 6), middle (n = 4), and lower (n = 5) stomach regions; b) between metal clips (n = 5) and surgical staples (n = 10); and c) between full (n = 9) and empty (n = 6) stomachs. CONCLUSIONS Motion in primary gastric tumor was evaluated with 320-multislice CT. According to this study, the 95th percentile values from the cumulative distributions of the RL, AP, and CC direction were 6.3 mm, 9.0 mm, and 13.6 mm, respectively.", "UNLABELLED The objective of this paper is to introduce the schematic protocol of radiofrequency (RF) ablation for the treatment of varicose veins. INDICATION anatomic or pathophysiologic indication includes venous diameter within 2-20 mm, reflux time \u22650.5 seconds and distance from the skin \u22655 mm or subfascial location. Access: it is recommended to access at or above the knee joint for great saphenous vein and above the mid-calf for small saphenous vein. Catheter placement: the catheter tip should be placed 2.0 cm inferior to the saphenofemoral or saphenopopliteal junction. Endovenous heat-induced thrombosis \u2265class III should be treated with low-molecular weight heparin. Tumescent solution: the composition of solution can be variable (e.g., 2% lidocaine 20 mL+500 mL normal saline+bicarbonate 2.5 mL with/without epinephrine). Infiltration can be done from each direction. Ablation: two cycles' ablation for the first proximal segment of saphenous vein and the segment with the incompetent perforators is recommended. The other segments should be ablated one time. During RF energy delivery, it is recommended to apply external compression. Concomitant procedure: It is recommended to do simultaneously ambulatory phlebectomy. For sclerotherapy, it is recommended to defer at least 2 weeks. Post-procedural management: post-procedural ambulation is encouraged to reduce the thrombotic complications. Compression stocking should be applied for at least 7 days. Minor daily activity is not limited, but strenuous activities should be avoided for 2 weeks. It is suggested to take showers after 24 hours and tub baths, swimming, or soaking in water after 2 weeks.", " Background The pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus has spread worldwide and infected a large proportion of the human population. Discovery of new and effective drugs for the treatment of influenza is a crucial issue for the global medical community. According to our previous study, TSL-1, a fraction of the aqueous extract from the tender leaf of Toonasinensis, has demonstrated antiviral activities against pandemic influenza A (H1N1) through the down-regulation of adhesion molecules and chemokine to prevent viral attachment. Methods The aim of the present study was to identify the active compounds in TSL-1 which exert anti-influenza A (H1N1) virus effects. XTT assay was used to detect the cell viability. Meanwhile, the inhibitory effect on the pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus was analyzed by observing plaque formation, qRT-PCR, neuraminidase activity, and immunofluorescence staining of influenza A-specific glycoprotein. Results Both catechin and gallic acid were found to be potent inhibitors in terms of influenza virus mRNA replication and MDCK plaque formation. Additionally, both compounds inhibited neuraminidase activities and viral glycoprotein. The 50% effective inhibition concentration (EC50) of catechin and gallic acid for the influenza A (H1N1) virus were 18.4 \u03bcg/mL and 2.6 \u03bcg/mL, respectively; whereas the 50% cytotoxic concentrations (CC50) of catechin and gallic acid were >100 \u03bcg/mL and 22.1 \u03bcg/mL, respectively. Thus, the selectivity indexes (SI) of catechin and gallic acid were >5.6 and 22.1, respectively. Conclusion The present study demonstrates that catechin might be a safe reagent for long-term use to prevent influenza A (H1N1) virus infection; whereas gallic acid might be a sensitive reagent to inhibit influenza virus infection. We conclude that these two phyto-chemicals in TSL-1 are responsible for exerting anti-pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus effects.", " Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune disease characterised by the presence of antiphospholipid (aPL) antibodies that have prothrombotic activity. Antiphospholipid antibodies are associated with an increased risk of pregnancy complications (recurrent miscarriage, premature birth, intrauterine growth retardation) and thrombotic events (both arterial and venous). The most common thrombotic events include brain ischaemia (stroke or transient ischaemic attack) and deep vein thrombosis. To diagnose APS, the presence of aPL antibodies in two measurements and at least one thrombotic event or pregnancy complication are required. It is unclear if people with positive aPL antibodies but without any previous thrombotic events should receive primary antithrombotic prophylaxis. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of antiplatelet or anticoagulant agents versus placebo or no intervention or other intervention on the development of thrombosis in people with aPL antibodies who have not had a thrombotic event. We did not address obstetric outcomes in this review as these have been thoroughly addressed by other Cochrane Reviews. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register (4 December 2017), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (last search 29 November 2017), MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, CINAHL, and AMED (searched 4 December 2017), and trials registries (searched 29 November 2017). We also checked reference lists of included studies, systematic reviews, and practice guidelines, and contacted experts in the field. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared any antiplatelet or anticoagulant agents, or their combinations, at any dose and mode of delivery with placebo, no intervention, or other intervention. We also included RCTs that compared antiplatelet or anticoagulant agents with each other or that compared two different doses of the same drug. We included studies performed in people of any age and with no history of thrombosis (as defined by APS Sapporo classification criteria or updated Sydney classification criteria), but with aPL antibodies confirmed on at last two separate measurements. The studies included both pregnant women who tested positive for aPL antibodies and had a history of recurrent obstetric complications, as well as non-pregnancy related cases with positive screening for antibodies, in accordance with the criteria mentioned above. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Pairs of authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias for the included studies and quality of evidence using GRADE. Any discrepancies were resolved through discussion or by consulting a third review author when necessary. In addition, one review author checked all the extracted numerical data. MAIN RESULTS We included nine studies involving 1044 randomised participants. The studies took place in several countries and had different funding sources. No study was at low risk of bias in all domains. We classified all included studies as at unclear or high risk of bias in two or more domains. Seven included studies focused mainly on obstetric outcomes. One study included non-pregnancy-related cases, and one study included both pregnancy-related cases and other patients with positive results for aPL antibodies. The remaining studies concerned women with aPL antibodies and a history of pregnancy failure. Four studies compared anticoagulant with or without acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) versus ASA only and observed no clear difference in thrombosis risk (risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.25 to 3.77; 4 studies; 493 participants; low-quality evidence). No major bleeding was reported, but minor bleeding risk (nasal bleeding, menorrhagia) was higher in the anticoagulant with ASA group as compared with ASA alone in one study (RR 22.45, 95% CI 1.34 to 374.81; 1 study; 164 participants; low-quality evidence). In one study ASA was compared with placebo, and there were no clear differences in thrombosis (RR 5.21, 95% CI 0.63 to 42.97; 1 study; 98 participants; low-quality evidence) or minor bleeding risk between the groups (RR 3.13, 95% CI 0.34 to 29.01; 1 study; 98 participants; low-quality evidence), and no major bleeding was observed. Two studies compared ASA with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) versus placebo or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and no thrombotic events were observed in any of the groups. Moreover, there were no clear differences in the risk of bleeding requiring transfusion (RR 9.0, 95% CI 0.49 to 164.76; 1 study; 180 participants; moderate-quality evidence) or postpartum bleeding (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.60 to 2.81; 1 study; 180 participants; moderate-quality evidence) between the groups. Two studies compared ASA with high-dose LMWH versus ASA with low-dose LMWF or unfractionated heparin (UFH); no thrombotic events or major bleeding was reported. Mortality and quality of life data were not reported for any of the comparisons. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS There is insufficient evidence to demonstrate benefit or harm of using anticoagulants with or without ASA versus ASA alone in people with aPL antibodies and a history of recurrent pregnancy loss and with no such history; ASA versus placebo in people with aPL antibodies; and ASA with LMWH versus placebo or IVIG, and ASA with high-dose LMWH versus ASA with low-dose LMWH or UFH, in women with aPL antibodies and a history of recurrent pregnancy loss, for the primary prevention of thrombotic events. In a mixed population of people with a history of previous pregnancy loss and without such a history treated with anticoagulant combined with ASA, the incidence of minor bleeding (nasal bleeding, menorrhagia) was increased when compared with ASA alone. Studies that are adequately powered and that focus mainly on thrombotic events are needed to draw any firm conclusions on the primary prevention of thrombotic events in people with antiphospholipid antibodies.", "Genetic alleles that contribute to enhanced susceptibility or resistance to viral infections and virally induced diseases have often been first identified in mice before humans due to the significant advantages of the murine system for genetic studies. Herein we review multiple discoveries that have revealed significant insights into virus-host interactions, all made using genetic mapping tools in mice. Factors that have been identified include innate and adaptive immunity genes that contribute to host defense against pathogenic viruses such as herpes viruses, flaviviruses, retroviruses, and coronaviruses. Understanding the genetic mechanisms that affect infectious disease outcomes will aid the development of personalized treatment and preventive strategies for pathogenic infections.", "Background. The COVID pandemic has had a major impact on healthcare in hospitals, including the diagnosis and treatment of infections. Hospital-acquired infective endocarditis (HAIE) is a severe complication of medical procedures that has shown a progressive increase in recent years. Objectives. to determine whether the incidence of HAIE during the first two months of the epidemic (March-April 2020) was higher than previously observed and to describe the clinical characteristics of these cases. The probability of studied event (HAIE) during the studied period was calculate by Poisson distribution. Results. Four cases of HAIE were diagnosed in our institution during the study period. The incidence of HAIE during the study period was 2/patient-month and 0.25/patient-month during the previous 5 years (p=0.024). Two cases appeared during admission for COVID-19 with pulmonary involvement treated with metilprednisolone and tocilizumab. The other two cases were admitted to the hospital during the epidemic. All cases underwent central venous and urinary catheterization during admission. The etiology of HAIE was Enterococcus faecalis (2 cases), Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans (one case each). A source of infection was identified in three cases (central venous catheter, peripheral venous catheter, sternal wound infection, respectively). One patient was operated on. There were no fatalities during the first 30 days of follow-up. Conclusion. The incidence of HAIE during COVID-19 pandemic in our institution was higher than usual. In order to reduce the risk of this serious infection, optimal catheter care, appropriate use of corticosteroids and interleukin antagonists and early treatment of every local infection should be prioritized during coronavirus outbreaks.", " The incidence of anal abscess is relatively high, and the condition is most common in young men. METHODS A systematic review of the literature was undertaken. RESULTS This abscess usually originates in the proctodeal glands of the intersphincteric space. A distinction is made between subanodermal, intersphincteric, ischioanal, and supralevator abscesses. The patient history and clinical examination are diagnostically sufficient to establish the indication for surgery. Further examinations (endosonography, MRI) should be considered in recurrent abscesses or supralevator abscesses. The timing of the surgical intervention is primarily determined by the patient's symptoms, and acute abscess is generally an indication for emergency treatment. Anal abscesses are treated surgically. The type of access (transrectal or perianal) depends on the abscess location. The goal of surgery is thorough drainage of the focus of infection while preserving the sphincter muscles. The wound should be rinsed regularly (using tap water). The use of local antiseptics is associated with a risk of cytotoxicity. Antibiotic treatment is only necessary in exceptional cases. Intraoperative fistula exploration should be conducted with extreme care if at all; no requirement to detect fistula should be imposed. The risk of abscess recurrence or secondary fistula formation is low overall, but they can result from insufficient drainage. Primary fistulotomy should only be performed in case of superficial fistulas and by experienced surgeons. In case of unclear findings or high fistulas, repair should take place in a second procedure. CONCLUSION In this clinical S3 guideline, instructions for diagnosis and treatment of anal abscess are described for the first time in Germany.", "We report a case of extensive acute portal vein thrombosis (PVT) presenting with severe diffuse abdominal pain and impending small bowel infarction. The patient was successfully treated with ultrasound-accelerated catheter-directed thrombolysis (EKOS endowave system; Covidien, Mansfield, Massachusetts), which resulted in prompt recanalization of his portal vein (PV) and its tributaries. The patient eventually had ischemic stricture that necessitated bowel resection. However, we believe that our technique was successful in rapidly restoring the patency of the PV and its tributaries, and therefore, avoiding a life-threatening complication of more extensive bowel infarction. To our knowledge, the use of ultrasound-accelerated thrombolysis in treatment of PVT has not been previously described in the literature.", " AND PURPOSE MR imaging findings of aneurysm enlargement, aneurysm wall enhancement, perianeurysmal edema, and embolic phenomena following deployment of flow-diverting stents may be relevant to those patients who subsequently experience procedure-related intracranial hemorrhage. We sought to document the routine early postoperative MR imaging findings following flow-diverting stent insertion. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients requiring flow-diverting stent placement for treatment or retreatment of cerebral aneurysms were prospectively included in the study during a 26-month period. Early postprocedural MR imaging studies were obtained and compared with preoperative imaging. Patient clinical outcome data were also collected. RESULTS There were 34 stent-placement procedures during the study period. Aneurysm mural enhancement and mild new perianeurysmal edema were present in 50% and 14%, respectively. Any DWI lesion was present in 57% of cases. New or possibly new foci of susceptibility effect were found ipsilateral to the stent and not associated with diffusion restriction in 66% of cases. There were 2 cases (6%) of parenchymal hemorrhage and 2 major clinical complications (6%) causing permanent morbidity. CONCLUSIONS Asymptomatic aneurysm mural enhancement is frequently seen following flow-diverting stent placement and should not necessarily be interpreted as a sign of impending aneurysm rupture. This finding often persists despite complete aneurysm occlusion. New small brain parenchymal susceptibility foci following stent placement have not previously been reported, to our knowledge, but were common in our series.", "OBJECT To evaluate the introduction of intraoperative and postoperative pneumatic compression additionally to the use of compression stockings, low molecular weight heparin-LMWH and early mobilization, a retrospective study in cranial neurosurgery using intraoperative MRI was performed. METHODS A retrospective analysis of 207 neurosurgical patients using intraoperative MRI was performed. A group of 86 patients was treated with the additional use of intraoperative and postoperative pneumatic compression until mobilization out of bed. One hundred twenty-one patients were treated without the use of additional pneumatic compression. Postoperatively the patients were screened for deep venous thrombosis by ultrasound and pulmonary embolism by CT-scan if suspicious. Statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS The development of deep venous thrombosis was reduced from 9.9% to 3.5% in our patients with the additional use of intraoperative and postoperative pneumatic compression. That is a 64.6% relative risk reduction to develop deep venous thrombosis with the use of intraoperative and postoperative pneumatic compression. An additional 52% relative risk reduction was found for the chance of developing pulmonary embolism. In the 15 patients with detected deep venous thrombosis, the OR-time was more than 100 min longer than in the 192 patients without detected deep venous thrombosis. The difference between both groups was significant. CONCLUSION This study demonstrates the benefit of pneumatic compression with a risk reduction for the development of thromboembolic complications. OR-time is another risk factor that attributes to a significant risk for the development of thromboembolic complications.", "OBJECTIVE Spinal epidural arteriovenous fistulas (SEDAVFs) constitute a rare but treatable cause of vascular myelopathy and are a different subtype from the more common Type I spinal dural AVFs. The purpose of this study was to review a consecutive series of SEDAVFs from a single institution and report on the clinical presentations, functional status, and treatment outcomes. METHODS The authors identified all SEDAVFs treated at their institution from 2005 to 2015. SEDAVFs were defined as spinal AVFs in which the fistulous connection occurred in the epidural venous plexus. The clinical presentation, functional status, immediate treatment outcomes, and long-term neurological outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS Twenty-four patients with SEDAVFs were included in this study. The patients' mean age at presentation was 66.9 years. The most common presenting symptoms were pain and numbness (22 patients, 91.7%), followed by lower-extremity weakness (21 patients, 87.5%). The mean duration of symptoms prior to diagnosis was 11.8 months. Eighteen patients (75.0%) were treated with endovascular therapy alone, 4 (16.7) with surgery, and 2 (8.3%) with a combination of techniques. There was 1 major treatment-related complication (4.2%). Fifteen patients (62.5%) had improvement in disability, and 12 patients (54.5%) had improvement in sensory symptoms. CONCLUSIONS SEDAVFs often present with lower-extremity motor dysfunction and sensory symptoms. With the availability of newer liquid embolic agents, these lesions can be effectively treated with endovascular techniques. Surgery is also effective at treating these lesions, especially in situations where endovascular embolization fails or is not safe and in patients presenting with mass effect from compressive varices.", "OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate the early and late 7-year experience with the Endurant bifurcated stent graft system (Medtronic, Santa Rosa, Calif) in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms. METHODS Between November 14, 2007, and December 2013, 712 consecutive high-risk patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms underwent elective or urgent placement of an Endurant bifurcated endograft in our institution. The included patients were consecutive (all comers) and treated independently from their morphologic eligibility for use of the Endurant device based on the instructions for use. The primary study outcome was freedom from all-cause reintervention. RESULTS The median follow-up was 19.2 months (interquartile range, 6.3-35.9 months). Overall, 517 patients (72.6%) were treated on the basis of instructions for use conditions. On the other hand, 195 patients (27.4%) had morphologic data not consistent with the recommendations for the use of the Endurant system. The 30-day mortality was 1.4% (10 of 712). Nine patients (1.2%) were lost to follow-up because of relocation abroad. The overall mortality rate was 14.74% (101 of 703). Overall survival rate was 92.3% at 1 year, 86.4% at 2 years, and 65% at 5 years. Overall freedom from reintervention rate was 93.3%, 86.4%, and 65% at 1 year, 2 years, and 5 years, respectively. Five patients (0.7%) underwent a surgical conversion and explantation of the Endurant device. The reasons were endograft infection (n = 1), endoleak type Ia (n = 1), endoleak type II (n = 1), endograft and limb thrombotic occlusion (n = 1), and endotension (n = 1). The overall iliac limb occlusion rate was 2.1% (15 of 712). CONCLUSIONS The performance of the Endurant stent graft during a period of 7 years under real-life conditions was good, with low incidence of reinterventions and endoleaks.", " AND PURPOSE The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is the most widely used primary outcome measure in acute stroke trials. However, substantial interobserver variability impairs outcome assessment as well as reduces power of clinical trials. Guided by the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health, we developed a comprehensive, hierarchical assessment tool (miFUNCTION) to address the shortcomings of the modified Rankin Scale and deliver a more thorough understanding of disability following stroke. METHODS The initial construct validity of miFUNCTION was established in a pilot study of patients at an outpatient stroke prevention clinic that had been diagnosed with stroke within 60 days. To further assess criterion validity, miFUNCTION was compared against the modified Rankin Scale and other outcome measures within the Endovascular Treatment for Small Core and Anterior Circulation Proximal Occlusion With Emphasis on Minimizing CT to Recanalization Times (ESCAPE) trial. Logistic regression analysis with miFUNCTION as an outcome was used to demonstrate the beneficial effect of endovascular treatment. RESULTS The pilot study showed moderate inter-observer agreement (k = 0.585, p < 0.005) but near perfect correlation between miFUNCTION and modified Rankin Scale (\u03c1 = 0.821, p < 0.05). The correlation of miFUNCTION and modified Rankin Scale was near perfect again in the ESCAPE trial (\u03c1 = 0.944). Effect size of the multivariable models using modified Rankin Scale (adjusted odds ratio: 3.45, 95% confidence interval: 2.05-5.78) and miFUNCTION (adjusted odds ratio: 3.32, 95% confidence interval: 1.99-5.55) as an outcome measure for the ESCAPE trial patients was similar. CONCLUSIONS miFUNCTION is strongly associated with the degree of disability following stroke both in an outpatient setting and a clinical trial. Further work remains to assess sensitivity to change and to improve the inter-observer reliability of the scale.", "Although tunneled hemodialysis catheter must be considered the last option for vascular access, it is necessary in some circumstances in the dialysis patient. Thrombosis and infections are the main causes of catheter-related comorbidity. Fibrin sheath, intimately related with the biofilm, is the precipitating factor of this environment, determining catheter patency and patient morbidity. Its association with bacterial overgrowth and thrombosis has led to the search of multiple preventive measures. Among them is the development of catheter coatings to prevent thrombosis and infections. There are two kinds of treatments to cover the catheter surface: antithrombotic and antimicrobial coatings. In nondialysis-related settings, mainly in intensive care units, both have been shown to be efficient in the prevention of catheter-related infection. This includes heparin, silver, chlorhexidine, rifampicine and minocycline. In hemodialysis population, however, few studies on surface-treated catheters have been made and they do not provide evidence that shows complication reduction. The higher effectiveness of coatings in nontunneled catheters may depend on the short average life of these devices. Hemodialysis catheters need to be used over long periods of time and require clinical trials to show effectiveness of coatings over long periods. This also means greater knowledge of biofilm etiopathogeny and fibrin sheath development.", "Background/aim The aim of this study was to determine the usefulness of tigecycline in combination treatment of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia infections by evaluating the in vitro synergistic effects of tigecycline with various antibiotics using the E-test method. Materials and methods Synergy testing by E-test was performed with various antibiotic combinations in 10 S. maltophilia isolates identified as a cause of infection. The antibiotics used in the study included tigecycline (TGC), cefoperazone-sulbactam (CPS), ceftazidime (TZ), levofloxacin (LEV), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (cotrimoxazole) (TS). Four different combinations (TGCCPS, TGC-TZ, TGC-LEV, TGC-TS) were studied with the E-test synergy method. Results S. maltophilia isolates were found to have the highest level of susceptibility to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, tigecycline, and levofloxacin. The fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) index was calculated as FIC = MICAB/MICA + MICBA/MICB. The FIC index values were calculated and classified as synergistic (FIC < 0.5), additive (FIC = 0.5\u20131), indifferent (FIC = 1\u20134), and antagonistic (FIC > 4). According to FIC index values, synergy was found with the highest rate with TGC-CPS and TGC-LEV combinations (20%). Antagonistic activity was not found in any combination. Conclusion When trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole cannot be used because of resistance or allergy, tigecycline alone or in combination may be included as an alternative option. Although in vitro results are promising, clinical data are required.", "OBJECTIVES To compare hemoglobin concentration (Hb), RBC use, and patient outcomes when restrictive or liberal blood transfusion strategies are used to treat anemic (Hb\u226490 g/L) critically ill patients of age\u226555 years requiring\u22654 days of mechanical ventilation in ICU. DESIGN Parallel-group randomized multicenter pilot trial. SETTING Six ICUs in the United Kingdom participated between August 2009 and December 2010. PATIENTS One hundred patients (51 restrictive and 49 liberal groups). INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized to a restrictive (Hb trigger, 70 g/L; target, 71-90 g/L) or liberal (90 g/L; target, 91-110 g/L) transfusion strategy for 14 days or the remainder of ICU stay, whichever was longest. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Baseline comorbidity rates and illness severity were high, notably for ischemic heart disease (32%). The Hb difference among groups was 13.8 g/L (95% CI, 11.5-16.0 g/L); p<0.0001); mean Hb during intervention was 81.9 (SD, 5.1) versus 95.7 (6.3) g/L; 21.6% fewer patients in the restrictive group were transfused postrandomization (p<0.001) and received a median 1 (95% CI, 1-2; p=0.002) fewer RBC units. Protocol compliance was high. No major differences in organ dysfunction, duration of ventilation, infections, or cardiovascular complications were observed during intensive care and hospital follow-up. Mortality at 180 days postrandomization trended toward higher rates in the liberal group (55%) than in the restrictive group (37%); relative risk was 0.68 (95% CI, 0.44-1.05; p=0.073). This trend remained in a survival model adjusted for age, gender, ischemic heart disease, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, and total non-neurologic Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score at baseline (hazard ratio, 0.54 [95% CI, 0.28-1.03]; p=0.061). CONCLUSIONS A large trial of transfusion strategies in older mechanically ventilated patients is feasible. This pilot trial found a nonsignificant trend toward lower mortality with restrictive transfusion practice.", "Patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) often harbor significant disease burden within the CNS, specifically craniospinal-axis hemangioblastomas and endolymphatic sac tumors (ELSTs). The majority (60-80%) of patients with VHL harbor hemangioblastomas, and 10-15% will develop ELSTs. Advances in the understanding of the natural history and outcomes associated with the surgical management of VHL-associated tumors have led to improved management of patients with VHL. Optimizing indications for surgical intervention and refining of surgical techniques for these lesions can reduce patient morbidity associated with the management of this syndrome. In this article, we review the various aspects of perioperative management of patients with VHL, surgical indications and general operative principles for the management of hemangioblastomas and ELSTs, and outcomes associated with the surgical treatment of these tumors.", "Laparoscopic mini-gastric bypass surgery is a safe and simple surgical intervention for treating morbid obesity and diabetes mellitus and is now being performed more frequently. Radiologists must be critical in their postoperative evaluation of these patients. In this pictorial review, we explain and illustrate the surgical technique, normal postoperative anatomy, and associated complications as seen on imaging examinations, including fluoroscopy and computed tomography.", "Introduction The efficacy of the endovascular treatment of acute ischemic stroke has been substantiated by several recent randomized clinical trials. While intra-arterial therapy has significantly evolved in recent years, anatomic cerebrovascular variants and disease burden can present challenges to timely recanalization. We present the first reported case of anterior-to-posterior mechanical clot retrieval with use of a stent retriever. Case description A 53-year-old man presented with basilar artery thrombosis. Endovascular mechanical clot retrieval was performed. The typical, antegrade, access to the basilar artery thrombus was precluded by the findings of a hypoplastic left vertebral artery and an occluded proximal right vertebral artery. Given a number of factors including the patient's worsening symptoms and the high morbidity and mortality associated with basilar stroke, cross-circulation-anterior-to-posterior-intra-arterial therapy was performed. Thrombectomy of the basilar thrombus was achieved via the right internal carotid artery and right posterior communicating artery. Conclusion To our knowledge, we report the first case of cross-circulation, anterior-to-posterior thrombectomy, with the use of a stent-retriever device. Cross-circulation stroke treatment may be beneficial in cases of proximal vessel occlusion or anatomical constraints. Larger studies will need to evaluate the safety and efficacy of these approaches.", "PURPOSE Onyx has been successfully applied in the treatment of various neurovascular lesions. However, some experience is required to get accustomed to its unpredictable fluoroscopic visibility during injection. This in vitro study aimed to evaluate the characteristics of radiopacity change in a simulated embolization procedure. MATERIALS AND METHODS Using a bench-top Onyx injection experiment simulating a typical brain arteriovenous malformation embolization, nine cycles of casting modes (continuous injection) and plugging modes (injection with intermittent pauses) were performed. Radiodensity of Onyx droplets collected from the microcatheter tip and the distal head portion of the microcatheter were measured as time lapsed. Distribution of droplet radiodensity (radiodensity) and distribution of radiographic grade (grade) were analyzed and compared by repeated measurements. RESULTS Within-group analysis revealed no significant radiodensity change with time (P>0.05). The radiodensity was significantly higher in the casting mode than in the plugging mode (P<0.01). The lateral radiograph of the microcatheter showed higher radiopacity (P<0.01) and better evenness (P<0.01) in the casting mode than in the plugging mode. A significant difference in microcatheter attenuation (both radiographic grade mean and SD; P<0.01) was noted between the two modes. Radiodensity had a significant influence on the radiopacity and radiopacity evenness of the microcatheter. CONCLUSION The radiopacity of the Onyx can vary significantly over time because of early precipitation of tantalum powder. Radiopacity decreased significantly during plugging modes, characterized by pauses between injections.", "OBJECTIVE The purpose of this investigation was two-fold: first, we examined associations between suicidal ideation, maladaptive sleep patterns and abnormal sleep behaviors in a sleep center population, an understudied population in the domain of suicide research; and then, we explored whether significant associations remained after accounting for the possible influence of depressive symptoms. METHOD Data were analyzed from intake information obtained from 1584 adult patients presenting at a community-based private sleep medical center. The sample was parsed into a Suicidal Ideation (SI) group (N=211) and No Suicidal Ideation (NSI) group (N=1373). Comparisons of these groups were made on measures of self-reported sleep complaints, habits, and behaviors, suicidal ideation, depressive symptoms, and associated psychopathology. RESULTS Approximately 13% of participants reported suicidal ideation. Clinically significant suicidal ideation was present in 4.5% of the sample. Compared to the NSI group, the SI group showed a pervasive pattern of significantly greater frequency or severity of sleep problems in areas of insomnia, nightmares and other parasomnia behaviors, poor sleep quality, and sleep-related psychophysiologic conditioning as well as worse sleep-related impairment and quality of life. Several relationships were significant after controlling for depressive symptoms. DISCUSSION Suicidal ideation was consistently associated with a broad array of sleep complaints, even when controlling for level of depressive symptoms. As these self-reported sleep disturbances are treatable sleep disorders, future research should examine the efficacy of sleep and behavioral medicine for reducing the risk of suicidal ideation.", " Previous studies evaluating correlates of stent thrombosis (ST) have included mostly patients with bare metal stents and early-generation drug-eluting stents (DES) and have not systematically evaluated the role of intravascular ultrasound-guided stenting and high platelet reactivity on clopidogrel. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the frequency and correlates of ST in patients receiving DES, specifically examining the impact of risk factors modifiable by physician and patient behavior. METHODS AND RESULTS Assessment of Dual Anti-platelet Therapy With Drug-Eluting Stents (ADAPT-DES) was a multicenter, prospective study in patients undergoing successful coronary intervention with DES in whom routine platelet reactivity testing was performed. Definite or probable ST occurred in 92 (1.1%) of 8582 patients within 2 years. Independent baseline correlates of ST included presentation with an acute coronary syndrome (hazard ratio [HR]=1.81, P=0.01), insulin-treated diabetes mellitus (HR=1.91, P=0.02), previous myocardial infarction (HR=1.75, P=0.02), and peripheral arterial disease (HR=2.01, P=0.01). Independent treatment-related correlates included use of early generation DES (HR=1.75, P=0.02), no procedural intravascular ultrasound guidance (HR=1.75, P=0.04), and premature discontinuation of dual antiplatelet therapy (HR=2.67, P=0.003); high platelet reactivity on clopidogrel trended as a correlate of ST (HR=1.49, P=0.08). The 2-year risk of ST ranged from 0.3% to 10.0% when 0 to 3 modifiable risk factors were present. CONCLUSIONS After successful DES implantation, ST occurred within 2 years in 1.1% of patients and was strongly associated with fixed and modifiable risk factors. The frequency of ST may be reduced with intravascular ultrasound -guided stenting, assiduous adherence to dual antiplatelet therapy, and adequate P2Y12 platelet receptor inhibition.

Unique identifier: NCT00638794.", " Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has demonstrated its effectiveness in controlling metastases measuring less than 3 cm in several adult malignancies but not yet in osteosarcoma. We report our experience of RFA in the treatment of metastases in adolescents and young adults (AYA) with osteosarcoma. PROCEDURE Sixteen patients treated for osteosarcoma in French Society of Childhood Cancer centers had undergone an RFA procedure between 2006 and 2012. RESULTS Thirteen sessions were performed in 10 patients to treat 22 lung metastases. Seven patients were in complete remission at last follow up (range 19-51 months; median, 24 months after RFA). None had a recurrence at RFA sites. We report three cases each of hemoptysis and pneumothorax. Eight sessions were performed in seven patients to treat bone lesions. PROCEDURE was intended as: curative for a small metastatic lesion (n = 3, all in remission more than 3 years after); local control of small bone lesions in multi-metastatic diseases (n = 3); analgesia (n = 1). Complications included one first-degree burn, one fracture, and one soft tissue infection. CONCLUSIONS RFA is feasible in AYA with osteosarcoma. It efficiently achieved local control of small peripheral lung metastases. Its role in the curative care of small secondary bone lesions remains to be confirmed.", "Polymeric nanoparticles-based therapeutics show great promise in the treatment of a wide range of diseases, due to the flexibility in which their structures can be modified, with intricate definition over their compositions, structures and properties. Advances in polymerization chemistries and the application of reactive, efficient and orthogonal chemical modification reactions have enabled the engineering of multifunctional polymeric nanoparticles with precise control over the architectures of the individual polymer components, to direct their assembly and subsequent transformations into nanoparticles of selective overall shapes, sizes, internal morphologies, external surface charges and functionalizations. In addition, incorporation of certain functionalities can modulate the responsiveness of these nanostructures to specific stimuli through the use of remote activation. Furthermore, they can be equipped with smart components to allow their delivery beyond certain biological barriers, such as skin, mucus, blood, extracellular matrix, cellular and subcellular organelles. This tutorial review highlights the importance of well-defined chemistries, with detailed ties to specific biological hurdles and opportunities, in the design of nanostructures for various biomedical delivery applications.", " During the 2014-2016 Ebolavirus (EBOV) outbreak, several candidate therapeutics were used in EBOV-infected patients in clinical trials and under expanded access for emergency use. This review will focus briefly on medications used during the outbreak. We will discuss current therapeutic candidates and their status and will then turn to a related and essential topic: supportive care and the standard of care for filovirus infected patients. Potential benefits and pitfalls of combination therapies for filoviruses will be discussed. Areas covered: Clinical trials of therapeutics targeting EBOV; clinical usage of therapeutics during recent EBOV outbreak; potential need for combination therapy; role of supportive care in treatment of Ebola virus disease (EVD). Expert commentary: In the absence of another large scale EBOV outbreak, the path to therapeutic product licensure in the United States of America (USA) would need to be via the FDA Animal Rule. However, human data may be needed to supplement animal data. The future of filovirus therapeutics may therefore benefit by establishing the ability to implement clinical trials in an outbreak setting in a timely fashion. Supportive care guidelines for filovirus infection should be defined and established as standard of care for treatment of EVD.", "OBJECTIVES To provide a comprehensive summary of the implications of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on orthodontic treatment, contingency management, and provision of emergency orthodontic treatment, using currently available data and literature. MATERIALS AND METHODS Orthodontically relevant sources of information were searched using electronic databases including PubMed and Google Scholar and current reports from major health bodies such as Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, World Health Organization, National Institutes of Health, and major national orthodontic associations. RESULTS Where available, peer-reviewed and more recent publications were given priority. Due to the rapidly evolving nature of COVID-19 and limitations in quality of evidence, a narrative synthesis was undertaken. Relevant to orthodontics, human-to human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurs predominantly through the respiratory tract via droplets, secretions (cough, sneeze), and or direct contact, where the virus enters the mucous membrane of the mouth, nose, and eyes. The virus can remain stable for days on plastic and stainless steel. Most infected persons experience a mild form of disease, but those with advanced age or underlying comorbidities may suffer severe respiratory and multiorgan complications. CONCLUSIONS During the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, elective orthodontic treatment should be suspended and resumed only when permitted by federal, provincial, and local health regulatory authorities. Emergency orthodontic treatment can be provided by following a contingency plan founded on effective communication and triage. Treatment advice should be delivered remotely first when possible, and where necessary, in-person treatment can be performed in a well-prepared operatory following the necessary precautions and infection prevention and control (IPAC) protocol.", " Certain proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) interfere with clopidogrel metabolism, potentially attenuating P2Y12 receptor inhibition. Previous observational and randomized trials report conflicting results regarding the clinical significance of this pharmacological interaction. We examined the interaction between concomitant administration of PPI and clopidogrel on platelet reactivity and clinical outcomes in the large-scale, prospective Assessment of Dual AntiPlatelet Therapy With Drug-Eluting Stents study. METHODS AND RESULTS On-treatment P2Y12 platelet reactivity testing was performed using the VerifyNow assay after clopidogrel loading and successful drug-eluting stent implantation at 11 sites in the United States and Germany. PPIs were prescribed at the discretion of treating physicians; patients were followed for 2 years. High platelet reactivity was defined as P2Y12 reactivity units >208. Of 8582 enrolled patients, 2697 (31.4%) were taking a PPI at the time of coronary intervention. After adjustment for differences in baseline characteristics, PPI use was independently associated with high platelet reactivity (odds ratio, 1.38: 95% confidence interval, 1.25-1.52, P=0.0001). A total of 2162 (25.2%) patients were prescribed a PPI at hospital discharge. In a propensity-adjusted multivariable analysis, discharge PPI use was independently associated with increased risk for postdischarge major adverse cardiac events (cardiac death, myocardial infarction, or ischemia-driven target lesion revascularization) at 2-year follow-up (hazard ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.42, P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS In patients treated with clopidogrel after successful drug-eluting stents implantation, the concomitant administration of PPI was associated with high platelet reactivity and a greater rate of adverse outcomes during long-term follow-up. Additional studies are warranted to determine the risk-benefit ratio of PPIs in patients with drug-eluting stents treated with clopidogrel.

It focuses on treating the person living with dementia as a person first and foremost. Supporting personhood in dementia is the key goal of person-centred care. Existing qualitative research examines what personhood means to the person living with dementia and explores what is important to their personhood and sense of self. However, to date little work has focused on synthesising these studies. Methods: This is a protocol for a qualitative evidence synthesis of personhood in dementia. The review examines qualitative peer-reviewed research of the perspectives and experiences of personhood for people living with dementia. A systematic search will be carried out on eight electronic databases and supplemented by other purposeful literature search methods. Title and abstract screening, and full text screening will be carried out by two authors independently. Included studies will be critically appraised. Thematic synthesis will be conducted on all of the included studies. Confidence in the review findings will be assessed using GRADE CERQual. Discussion: The findings from this synthesis will be useful to health care providers and policy makers seeking to understand what personhood means for people living with dementia. The findings will also inform optimal service provision, as well as outcome measures in dementia.

When occurring, bacterial adherence and biofilm formation on the mesh surface affect the implant's tissue integration and host tissue regeneration, making preventive measures to control prosthetic infection a major goal of prosthetic mesh improvement. METHODS This article reviews the literature on the infection of prosthetic meshes used in hernia repair to describe the in vitro and in vivo models used to examine bacterial adherence and biofilm formation on the surface of different biomaterials. Also discussed are the prophylactic measures used to control implant infection ranging from meshes soaked in antibiotics to mesh coatings that release antimicrobial agents in a controlled manner. RESULTS Prosthetic architecture has a direct effect on bacterial adherence and biofilm formation. Absorbable synthetic materials are more prone to bacterial colonization than non-absorbable materials. The reported behavior of collagen biomeshes, also called xenografts, in a contaminated environment has been contradictory, and their use in this setting needs further clinical investigation. New prophylactic mesh designs include surface modifications with an anti-adhesive substance or pre-treatment with antibacterial agents or metal coatings. CONCLUSIONS The use of polymer coatings that slowly release non-antibiotic drugs seems to be a good strategy to prevent implant contamination and reduce the onset of resistant bacterial strains. Even though the prophylactic designs described in this review are mainly focused on hernia repair meshes, these strategies can be extrapolated to other implantable devices, regardless of their design, shape or dimension.", " Previous studies have shown different pain characteristics in different types of laparoscopic operations, but pain pattern has not been studied in detail after laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair. To optimise preoperative patient information and postoperative analgesic treatment the present study investigated postoperative pain in terms of time course, pain intensity and individual pain components during the first 4 days after transabdominal preperitoneal hernia repair (TAPP). METHODS The study was a single-centre prospective trial including 50 consecutive male patients with primary or recurrent inguinal and/or femoral hernia undergoing elective repair. Several pain components (visceral pain, incisional pain and shoulder pain) were studied as well as pain at the three different trocar incisions. Pain was recorded before operation and on a daily basis during the first four postoperative days using a visual analogue and a verbal rating scale. We used 1 \u00d7 12 and 2 \u00d7 5 mm trocars for TAPP. RESULTS A total of 46 patients were available for analyses (age median 58 years, range 27-69 years). Visceral pain dominated significantly compared with incisional pain (P < 0.01), which again dominated over shoulder pain intensity and incidence (P < 0.01). Pain intensity did not significantly differ between different trocar incisions (5 and 12 mm) (P > 0.05). The overall pain intensity (a conglomerate of the different pain components) was most intense 3 h after TAPP and declined to preoperative levels on day 3 (P > 0.5). CONCLUSION Pain was most intense 3 h after the operation and declined to low levels within the first 3 days. Visceral pain was by far the dominating pain component compared with incisional and shoulder pain.", " The hemagglutinin/esterase (HE), spike precursor (S) and the S1 and S2 subunits of the spike precursor protein of bovine coronavirus were expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells, and the cell-fusing activity of each recombinant glycoprotein was examined. Extensive syncytia formation was observed in cells infected with the S2 recombinant but not with the HE or S1 recombinant baculoviruses. Fusion of Sf9 cells expressing the intact S protein precursor was evident after trypsin treatment. These results demonstrate that proteolytic cleavage of the S spike precursor is required for fusion induction and that the fusion is mediated by the S2 subunit. These observations may reflect the biological role of the S2 subunit in fusion-penetration during bovine coronavirus infection.", "IMPORTANCE It has not been established whether noninvasive ventilation (NIV) reduces the need for invasive mechanical ventilation in patients who develop hypoxemic acute respiratory failure after abdominal surgery. OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether noninvasive ventilation improves outcomes among patients developing hypoxemic acute respiratory failure after abdominal surgery. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Multicenter, randomized, parallel-group clinical trial conducted between May 2013 and September 2014 in 20 French intensive care units among 293 patients who had undergone abdominal surgery and developed hypoxemic respiratory failure (partial oxygen pressure <60 mm Hg or oxygen saturation [SpO2] \u226490% when breathing room air or <80 mm Hg when breathing 15 L/min of oxygen, plus either [1] a respiratory rate above 30/min or [2] clinical signs suggestive of intense respiratory muscle work and/or labored breathing) if it occurred within 7 days after surgical procedure. INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomly assigned to receive standard oxygen therapy (up to 15 L/min to maintain SpO2 of 94% or higher) (n = 145) or NIV delivered via facial mask (inspiratory pressure support level, 5-15 cm H2O; positive end-expiratory pressure, 5-10 cm H2O; fraction of inspired oxygen titrated to maintain SpO2 \u226594%) (n = 148). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was tracheal reintubation for any cause within 7 days of randomization. Secondary outcomes were gas exchange, invasive ventilation-free days at day 30, health care-associated infections, and 90-day mortality. RESULTS Among the 293 patients (mean age, 63.4 [SD, 13.8] years; n=224 men) included in the intention-to-treat analysis, reintubation occurred in 49 of 148 (33.1%) in the NIV group and in 66 of 145 (45.5%) in the standard oxygen therapy group within+ 7 days after randomization (absolute difference, -12.4%; 95% CI, -23.5% to -1.3%; P = .03). Noninvasive ventilation was associated with significantly more invasive ventilation-free days compared with standard oxygen therapy (25.4 vs 23.2 days; absolute difference, -2.2 days; 95% CI, -0.1 to 4.6 days; P = .04), while fewer patients developed health care-associated infections (43/137 [31.4%] vs 63/128 [49.2%]; absolute difference, -17.8%; 95% CI, -30.2% to -5.4%; P = .003). At 90 days, 22 of 148 patients (14.9%) in the NIV group and 31 of 144 (21.5%) in the standard oxygen therapy group had died (absolute difference, -6.5%; 95% CI, -16.0% to 3.0%; P = .15). There were no significant differences in gas exchange. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure following abdominal surgery, use of NIV compared with standard oxygen therapy reduced the risk of tracheal reintubation within 7 days. These findings support use of NIV in this setting. TRIAL REGISTRATION clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01971892.", "The key questions addressed in this summary are whether clot removal should be part of the preferred therapy for patients with acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT), and whether there is evidence that a strategy of thrombus removal offers better outcomes for patients than anticoagulation alone. Evidence is defined as an outward sign or something that furnishes proof. Evidence in medicine is not limited to direct, blinded comparisons of one form of treatment compared with another but rather the body of knowledge that provides insight to clinicians to offer patient care. Evidence-based medicine follows from information available to form the foundation for the use of a treatment for a specific disease. Reports of strategies of thrombus removal for acute DVT, especially in patients with iliofemoral DVT, consistently demonstrate improved outcomes relative to postthrombotic morbidity. This summary reviews the evidence supporting this strategy as the preferred initial management of patients with extensive proximal DVT.", "OBJECTIVES The Selecting Therapeutic Targets in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (STRIDE) program was initiated by the International Organization for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IOIBD). It examined potential treatment targets for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) to be used for a \"treat-to-target\" clinical management strategy using an evidence-based expert consensus process. METHODS A Steering Committee of 28 IBD specialists developed recommendations based on a systematic literature review and expert opinion. Consensus was gained if \u226575% of participants scored the recommendation as 7-10 on a 10-point rating scale (where 10=agree completely). RESULTS The group agreed upon 12 recommendations for ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). The agreed target for UC was clinical/patient-reported outcome (PRO) remission (defined as resolution of rectal bleeding and diarrhea/altered bowel habit) and endoscopic remission (defined as a Mayo endoscopic subscore of 0-1). Histological remission was considered as an adjunctive goal. Clinical/PRO remission was also agreed upon as a target for CD and defined as resolution of abdominal pain and diarrhea/altered bowel habit; and endoscopic remission, defined as resolution of ulceration at ileocolonoscopy, or resolution of findings of inflammation on cross-sectional imaging in patients who cannot be adequately assessed with ileocolonoscopy. Biomarker remission (normal C-reactive protein (CRP) and calprotectin) was considered as an adjunctive target. CONCLUSIONS Evidence- and consensus-based recommendations for selecting the goals for treat-to-target strategies in patients with IBD are made available. Prospective studies are needed to determine how these targets will change disease course and patients' quality of life.", "OBJECTIVES Watertight dural closure is imperative after neurosurgical procedures because inadequately treated leakage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can have serious consequences. In this study, the authors test the use of a new gelatin glue as a dural sealant in in vitro and in vivo canine models of transdural CSF leakage. METHODS The in vitro model was sutured semicircles of canine dura mater and artificial dural substitute. The sutures were sealed with gelatin glue (n = 20), fibrin glue (n = 20), or a polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based hydrogel sealant (n = 20). Each sample was set in a device to measure water pressure, and pressure was increased until leakage occurred. Bonding strength was subjectively evaluated. The in vivo model was dogs who underwent dural excision and received either no sealant (control group; n = 5) or gelatin glue sealant (n = 5) before dural closure. Twenty-eight days post-surgery, the maximum intracranial pressure was measured at the cisterna magna using Valsalva maneuver and tissue adhesion was evaluated. RESULTS The water pressure at which leakage occurred in the in vitro model was higher with gelatin glue (76\u00b75 \u00b1 39\u00b78 mmHg) than with fibrin glue (38\u00b73 \u00b1 27\u00b74 mmHg, P < 0\u00b7001) or the PEG-based hydrogel sealant (46\u00b73 \u00b1 20\u00b79 mmHg, P = 0\u00b7007). Bonding strength was higher for the gelatin glue than fibrin glue (P < 0\u00b7001) or PEG-based hydrogel sealant (P = 0\u00b7001). The maximum intracranial pressure in the in vivo model was higher for the gelatin glue group (59\u00b70 \u00b1 2\u00b72 mmHg) than the control group (13\u00b78 \u00b1 4\u00b70 mmHg, P < 0\u00b7001). Tissue adhesion was lower for the gelatin glue group than the control group (P = 0\u00b7005). DISCUSSION The new gelatin glue provides an effective watertight closure when used as an adjunct to sutured dural repair.", "Liver failure is associated to high mortality due to the accumulation of protein-bound metabolites, such as bilirubin, not removed by conventional hemodialysis. Different methods can efficiently remove them, such as the molecular adsorbent recirculating system (MARS), plasma exchange (PEX), and bilirubin or plasma adsorption perfusion (PAP). No direct comparison exists between MARS, PEX and PAP, and current guidelines do not specify which method (and when) to use. We have retrospectively evaluated MARS, PEX and PAP in their effectiveness in lowering plasma bilirubin concentration, and their effects on liver and kidney function. A total of 98 patients have been recruited, which comprised 68 patients treated with PAP (177 sessions), 16 patients with PEX (41 sessions) and 11 patients with MARS (21 sessions). Bilirubin, creatinine, liver enzymes were analyzed before and after the first treatment with each technique. The three methods did not differ for bilirubin lowering efficiency, with MARS showing only slightly less effective reductions. Finally, the three techniques did not differ in the amount of change of cholinesterase, but a lower reduction in AST was found using PAP. Our retrospective observation is one of the largest case series of hepatic failure treated with bilirubin absorption. The choice of the technique cannot be based on the desired reduction in bilirubin concentration. Based on costs and duration of treatment, we suggest that PAP could be considered as a first-line approach. In case of kidney involvement, MARS remains a valuable option.", "OBJECTIVES Watertight dural closure is imperative after neurosurgical procedures because inadequately treated leakage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can have serious consequences.

Our response emphasizes the importance of having an ethically sound framework to inform our decisions, requiring caregivers to consider what is ethically optimal and feasible for the patient. It is increasingly important to understand the ethical principles and to appropriately apply them to both patient management decisions and guide scarce resource allocation. If we are to be prepared to face the many challenges of this pandemic, we must prioritize the ethical demands to our treatment and management concerns.", "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a chronic and heterogeneous disorder that leads to early mortality, stroke, and cardiovascular disease (CVD). OSA is defined by the apnea-hypopnea index, which is an index of OSA severity that combines apneas (pauses in breathing) and hypopneas (partial obstructions in breathing) associated with hypoxemia. Yet, other sleep metrics (i.e., oxygen nadir, arousal frequency), along with clinical symptoms and molecular markers could be better predictors of stroke and CVD outcomes in OSA. The recent focus on personalized medical care introduces the possibility of a unique approach to the treatment of OSA based on its phenotypes, defined by pathophysiological mechanisms and/or clinical presentation. We summarized what is known about OSA and its phenotypes, and review the literature on factors or intermediate markers that could increase stroke risk and CVD in patients with OSA. The OSA phenotypes where divided across three different domains (1) clinical symptoms (i.e., daytime sleepiness), (2) genetic/molecular markers, and (3) experimental data-driven approach (e.g., cluster analysis). Finally, we further highlight gaps in the literature framing a research agenda.", "Based on systematic review of the role of clinical treatment, disease control and scientific research, and combining with the problems exposed by the COVID-19 epidemic, suggestions were proposed to reform and improve the prevention and treatment system for major epidemics diseases in China. In clinical treatment, it is necessary to enhance clinical staff's awareness of law-based reporting, capabilities of syndromic surveillance, the use of infectious diseases reporting systems, and to improve national or local monitoring platforms for emerging infectious diseases detection. In terms of disease control, it is important to provide authorities to disease control departments through laws and regulations, improve the quantity and quality of related human resources, and strengthen the applied research and technical readiness targeted infections disease prevention, control and emergency preparedness. As for scientific research in major epidemic response, it is essential to strengthen research projects guided by national requests, build research institutions that can \"make a final decision\", establish national and regional key laboratories, and strengthen strategic technical reserve for emergency disease control and treatment.", "OBJECTIVES To map the existing literature and describe interventions aimed at building the capacity of patients to participate in care during hospitalisation by: (1) describing and categorising the aspects of care targeted by these interventions and (2) identifying the behaviour change techniques (BCTs) used in these interventions. A patient representative participated in all aspects of this project. DESIGN Scoping review. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL (Inception -2017). STUDY SELECTION Studies reporting primary research studies on building the capacity of hospitalised adult patients to participate in care which described or included one or more structured or systematic interventions and described the outcomes for at least the key stakeholder group were included. DATA EXTRACTION Title and abstract screening and full text screening were conducted by pairs of trained reviewers. One reviewer extracted data, which were verified by a second reviewer. Interventions were classified according to seven aspects of care relevant to hospital settings. BCTs identified in the articles were assigned through consensus of three reviewers. RESULTS Database searches yielded a total 9899 articles, resulting in 87 articles that met the inclusion criteria. Interventions directed at building patient capacity to participate in care while hospitalised were categorised as those related to improving: patient safety (20.9%); care coordination (5.7%); effective treatment (5.7%) and/or patient-centred care using: bedside nursing handovers (5.7%); communication (29.1%); care planning (14%) or the care environment (19.8%). The majority of studies reported one or more positive outcomes from the defined intervention. Adding new elements (objects) to the environment and restructuring the social and/or physical environment were the most frequently identified BCTs. CONCLUSIONS The majority of studies to build capacity for participation in care report one or more positive outcomes, although a more comprehensive analysis is warranted.", "Endovascular approach is now the first option for the treatment of most intracranial aneurysms (IA). However, remaining limitations are the suboptimal stability of aneurysm occlusion and the treatment of complex IA. The use of conventional and flow diverter stents has partially addressed these limitations. Nevertheless, as intraluminal devices, stents require aggressive antiplatelet therapy and are associated with higher thromboembolic (TE) complication rates. Intrasaccular flow disrupters (IFD) are newly developed braided-wire devices designed to achieve flow disruption at the neck without placing material in the parent vessel and without the need of antiplatelet therapy. First clinical series have shown promising anatomical and clinical results. Our purpose is to describe the available IFD and to review the literature about their efficacy, safety, limitations, and developments.", "UNLABELLED The innate immune response is the first line of defense against viruses, and type I interferon (IFN) is a critical component of this response. Similar to other viruses, the gammacoronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) has evolved under evolutionary pressure to evade and counteract the IFN response to enable its survival. Previously, we reported that IBV induces a delayed activation of the IFN response. In the present work, we describe the resistance of IBV to IFN and the potential role of accessory proteins herein. We show that IBV is fairly resistant to the antiviral state induced by IFN and identify that viral accessory protein 3a is involved in resistance to IFN, as its absence renders IBV less resistant to IFN treatment. In addition to this, we found that independently of its accessory proteins, IBV inhibits IFN-mediated phosphorylation and translocation of STAT1. In summary, we show that IBV uses multiple strategies to counteract the IFN response. IMPORTANCE In the present study, we show that infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is resistant to IFN treatment and identify a role for accessory protein 3a in the resistance against the type I IFN response. We also demonstrate that, in a time-dependent manner, IBV effectively interferes with IFN signaling and that its accessory proteins are dispensable for this activity. This study demonstrates that the gammacoronavirus IBV, similar to its mammalian counterparts, has evolved multiple strategies to efficiently counteract the IFN response of its avian host, and it identifies accessory protein 3a as multifaceted antagonist of the avian IFN system.", "Landiolol is an intravenous ultra-short acting beta-blocker which has been used in Japan for many years to prevent and/or to treat post-operative atrial fibrillation following cardiac surgery. The drug is now available in Europe. This article is a systematic review of literature regarding the use of landiolol in that specific surgical setting.", " Endovascular recanalization of a completely occluded proximal internal carotid artery (ICA) with underlying stenosis may be challenging owing to a possible thrombotic component. This is especially true when the landing zone for a balloon-tipped guiding catheter (BGC) at the bulb portion is insufficient. Sequential application of the balloons of a BGC and an angioplasty catheter may prevent thromboembolism during revascularization. This study analyzed the safety and effectiveness of this relay-balloon technique. METHODS Ten consecutive patients with acute symptomatic proximal ICA occlusion were treated by the relay-balloon technique. Outcomes analyzed included technical success rate, procedure-related complications, and short-term clinical outcomes. RESULTS Successful revascularization was achieved in all 10 patients. One patient experienced a post-procedural infarct extension, but there was no change in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score. Mean NIHSS score decreased from 12.0\u00b15.6 (range 0-18) initially to 6.8\u00b15.4 (range 0-18) at discharge. CONCLUSIONS The relay-balloon technique is safe and effective in the endovascular revascularization of acute symptomatic proximal ICA occlusions, which are at high risk of distal thromboembolism due to insufficient landing zone for the BGC.", "Major ischaemic stroke is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in industrialized countries. For patients with acute stroke, fast and effective vessel recanalization is important for successful treatment. Neurothrombectomy--that is, angiographically performed mechanical thrombus removal from intracranial arteries--results in higher recanalization rates than with pharmaceutical thrombolysis alone, but the value of this treatment in terms of clinical outcome remains to be established. This article summarizes the history of intra-arterial stroke treatment, outlines the recent developments and the different techniques used, and discusses the results of current studies on neurothrombectomy. Owing to the high morphological and clinical variability of stroke, careful patient selection in future randomized controlled trials will be crucial for assessment of the true potential of neurothrombectomy.", " To assess the technical and clinical outcome of percutaneous insertion of tunneled peritoneal catheters in the palliative treatment of refractory malignant ascites and to determine the safety and feasibility of intraperitoneal administration of cytotoxic drugs through the tunneled catheter. MATERIALS AND METHODS Consecutive patients palliatively treated with a tunneled peritoneal catheter to drain the malignant ascites were identified. Patients' medical history, procedural and clinical follow-up data, including complications and estimated survival, were reviewed. Additionally, a sub analysis of the patients with widespread ovarian cancer and refractory ascites treated with or without intraperitoneal administration of cytotoxic drugs was made. RESULTS In all 94 patients it was technically feasible to insert the peritoneal drainage catheter and to drain a median of 3260 cc (range 100 cc - 8500 cc) of malignant ascitic fluid. Post procedural complications included catheter infection (n = 2; 2%), fluid leakage around the entry site (n = 4; 4%), catheter occlusion (n = 2; 2%), sleeve formation around the catheter tip (n = 1; 1%) and accidental loss of the catheter (n = 1; 1%). There was no increase in catheter infection rate in patients treated with or without intraperitoneal administration of cytotoxic drugs. Median overall survival after catheter insertion is 1.7 months. CONCLUSIONS Percutaneous insertion of a tunneled Tenckhoff catheter for the palliative drainage of malignant ascites and intraperitoneal infusion of cytotoxic drugs is feasible and associated with a very low complication rate, including catheter infection. These tunneled peritoneal lines are beneficial for symptomatic palliative treatment of refractory ascites and allow safe intraperitoneal chemotherapy.", "Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), a member of the Phlebovirus genus in the Bunyaviridae family, is transmitted by mosquitoes and infects both humans and domestic animals, particularly cattle and sheep. Since primary RVFV strains must be handled in BSL-3+ or BSL-4 facilities, a RVFV cell\u2013cell fusion assay will facilitate the investigation of RVFV glycoprotein function under BSL-2 conditions. As for other members of the Bunyaviridae family, RVFV glycoproteins are targeted to the Golgi, where the virus buds, and are not efficiently delivered to the cell surface. However, overexpression of RVFV glycoproteins using an alphavirus replicon vector resulted in the expression of the glycoproteins on the surface of multiple cell types. Brief treatment of RVFV glycoprotein expressing cells with mildly acidic media (pH 6.2 and below) resulted in rapid and efficient syncytia formation, which we quantified by \u03b2-galactosidase \u03b1-complementation. Fusion was observed with several cell types, suggesting that the receptor(s) for RVFV is widely expressed or that this acid-dependent virus does not require a specific receptor to mediate cell\u2013cell fusion. Fusion occurred over a broad temperature range, as expected for a virus with both mosquito and mammalian hosts. In contrast to cell fusion mediated by the VSV-G glycoprotein, RVFV glycoprotein-dependent cell fusion could be prevented by treating target cells with trypsin, indicating that one or more proteins (or protein-associated carbohydrate) on the host cell surface are needed to support membrane fusion. The cell\u2013cell fusion assay reported here will make it possible to study the membrane fusion activity of RVFV glycoproteins in a high-throughput format and to screen small molecule inhibitors for the ability to block virus-specific membrane fusion.", "PURPOSE Flow diverters are increasingly used in the treatment of complex and giant intracranial aneurysms. However, they are associated with complications like late aneurysmal rupture. Additionally, flow diverters show focal structural decrease in luminal diameter without any intimal hyperplasia. This resembles a \"fish mouth\" when viewed en face. In this pilot study, we tested the hypothesis of a possible association between flow diverter fish-mouthing and delayed-type hypersensitivity to its metal constituents. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed patient records from our center between May 2010 and November 2015. A total of nine patients had flow diverter fish mouthing. A control group of 25 patients was selected. All study participants underwent prospective patch test to detect hypersensitivity to flow diverter metal constituents. Analysis was performed using logistic regression analysis and Wilcoxon sign rank sum test. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to test variables to predict flow diverter fish mouthing. RESULTS The association between flow diverter fish mouthing and positive patch test was not statistically significant. In multivariate analysis, history of allergy and maximum aneurysm size category was associated with flow diverter fish mouthing. This was further confirmed on Wilcoxon sign rank sum test. CONCLUSION The study showed statistically significant association between flow diverter fish mouthing and history of contact allergy and a small aneurysmal size. Further large-scale studies are needed to detect a statistically significant association between flow diverter fish mouthing and patch test. We recommend early and more frequent follow-up imaging in patients with contact allergy to detect flow diverter fish mouthing and its subsequent evolution.", "The basic treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) over the past several decades has consisted of anticoagulation only, with inferior vena cava filtration for those who either failed or could not tolerate anticoagulation. Until recently no randomized trials had studied the efficacy of thrombolysis in DVT despite advances in techniques and technologies for endovascular clot removal. This article is a review of the current evidence on catheter-based therapies for patients with DVT. Technical considerations to improve outcome as well as optimal patient selection are discussed.", ": A possible association between COVID-19 infection and thrombosis, either as a direct consequence of the virus or as a complication of inflammation, is emerging in the literature. Data on the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) are extremely limited. METHODS: We describe three cases of thromboembolism refractory to heparin treatment, the incidence of VTE in an inpatient cohort, and a case-control study to identify risk factors associated with VTE. RESULTS: We identified 274 confirmed (208) or probable (66) COVID-19 patients. 21 (7.7%) were diagnosed with VTE. D-dimer was elevated in both cases (confirmed VTE) and controls (no confirmed VTE) but higher levels were seen in confirmed VTE cases (4.1 vs 1.2 \u00b5g/mL, P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Incidence of VTE is high in patients hospitalised with COVID-19. Urgent clinical trials are needed to evaluate the role of anticoagulation in COVID-19. Monitoring of D-dimer and anti-factor Xa levels may be beneficial in guiding management.", " AND PURPOSE The role of flow diversion in the management of aneurysms remains unknown. We sought to evaluate the community agreement regarding indications for flow diversion. MATERIALS AND METHODS A portfolio of 35 difficult aneurysm cases was sent to 40 clinicians with varying backgrounds and experience. Responders were asked whether they considered flow diversion a treatment option, whether other options were possible, whether recruitment in a randomized trial would be considered, and to select their final choice. Agreement was studied by using \u03ba statistics. RESULTS Decisions for flow diversion were more frequent (n = 300, 39%) than decisions to coil (n = 163, 21.2%), to observe (n = 121, 15.7%), to occlude the parent vessel (n = 102, 13.2%), or to clip (n = 66, 8.6%). Sidewall aneurysm morphology was associated with flow diversion as the final choice (P = .001). Interjudge agreement was fair at best (\u03ba <0.3) for all cases and all judges, despite high certainty levels (range, 7.2-8.9 \u00b1 2.0 on a 0-10 scale). Agreement was no better within specialties or with more experience. All patients were judged to have other treatment options. Judges were willing to offer trial participation in 417 of 741 (56.3%) scenarios, more frequently when the aneurysm was sidewall (P = .001) or in the anterior circulation (P = .028). CONCLUSIONS Individuals did not agree regarding the indications for flow diversion. There is sufficient uncertainty to justify trials designed to protect patients from the potential risks of premature adoption of an innovation.", " Treatment of internal carotid ruptured blister aneurysms (IC-RBA) presents many challenges to neurosurgeons because of the high propensity for rebleeding during intervention. The role of a Pipeline Embolization Device (PED) in the treatment of this challenging aneurysm subtype remains undefined despite theoretical advantages. OBJECTIVE To present a series of 11 patients treated with a PED and to discuss the management and results of this novel application of flow diverters. METHODS Medical records of patients who presented with IC-RBA from May 2011 to March 2013 were retrospectively reviewed at 6 institutions in the United States. All relevant data were independently compiled. RESULTS A total of 12 IC-RBAs in 11 patients were treated during the study period. Nine (75%) were treated with a single PED; 1 was treated with 2 PEDs; 1 was treated with coils and 1 PED; and 1 was treated with coils and 2 PEDs. Three (27%) had major perioperative complications: middle cerebral artery territory infarction, vision loss, and death. Seven patients demonstrated complete obliteration of the aneurysm in postoperative imaging. Early clinical outcomes were favorable (modified Rankin Scale score, 0-2) in all 10 survivors. CONCLUSION This study demonstrates the feasibility and safety of using the PED to treat IC-RBA with fair initial results. The proper introduction and management of antiplatelet regimen are key for successful results. Bleeding complications related to dual antiplatelet therapy were similar to those in previous studies of stent-assisted coiling for the same population. Larger cohort analysis is needed to define the precise role of flow diverters in the treatment of IC-RBA.", " Uncontrolled antidepressant trials suggest that anxious patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) are less responsive to antidepressant treatment than less anxious patients. The objective of this study is to determine whether specific antidepressant effects, estimated by drug-placebo differences, are reduced in anxious depression during treatment of MDD with duloxetine. METHODS This is a retrospective secondary pooled analysis of all placebo-controlled trials of duloxetine at therapeutic doses conducted by the sponsor in outpatients with nonpsychotic unipolar MDD, using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD). Anxious depression was defined by > or =7 on the anxiety/somatization factor of the HAMD. Response was defined as > or =50% improvement from baseline to endpoint on the HAMD. Remission was defined as an endpoint HAMD< or =7. Analyses were performed in the intent-to-treat sample with at least one post-treatment rating. RESULTS Eleven trials included 2,841 patients of whom 1,326 were classified as anxious and 1,515 as nonanxious. Change on the HAMD was greater with duloxetine than placebo in both anxious (9.91 versus 7.55, P<.001) and nonanxious (6.65 versus 5.23, P<.001) patients. Level of anxiety had no effect on the drug-placebo differences. Response and remission rates were significantly greater in duloxetine than placebo-treated patients and drug-placebo differences were unaffected by anxious status. Use of HAMD items psychic and somatic anxiety to define anxious subgroups had similar outcomes. CONCLUSIONS Duloxetine was more effective than placebo in achieving response and remission in both anxious and nonanxious patients. Anxious status did not affect the magnitude of the drug effect.", "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a global pandemic in just a few months, causing millions infected. Nearly 20% of COVID-19 patients present severe coagulation abnormalities, which may occur in almost all of the severe and critical ill COVID-19 cases. Concomitant venous thromboembolism (VTE), a potential cause of unexplained deaths, has been frequently reported in COVID-19 cases, but its management is still challenging due to the complexity between antithrombotic therapy and coagulation disorders. Based on frontline practical experience and comprehensive literature review, here a panel of experts and physicians from China and Europe developed an evidence and opinion-based consensus on the prophylaxis and management of VTE associated with COVID-19. This statement aims for clinicians treating COVID-19 and provides practical recommendations in detailed situations, for example, how to choose thromboprophylactic measures for patients with diverse severity of disease and bleeding risk, or which kind of anticoagulant should be prescribed. With limited experience on COVID19-associated VTE, this expert consensus statement should be helpful for clinicians worldwide with specific suggestions.", "OBJECTIVES Prognosis for patients with locally advanced esophagogastric adenocarcinoma (EAC) is poor with surgery alone, and adjuvant therapy after open esophagectomy is frequently not tolerated. After minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE); however, earlier return to normal function may render patients better able to receive adjuvant therapy. We examined whether primary MIE followed by adjuvant chemotherapy influenced survival compared with propensity-matched patients treated with neoadjuvant therapy. METHODS Patients with stage II or higher EAC treated with MIE (N = 375) were identified. Using 30 pretreatment covariates, propensity for assignment to either neoadjuvant followed by MIE (n = 183; 54%) or MIE as primary therapy (n = 156; 46%) was calculated, generating 97 closely matched pairs. Hazard ratios were adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, smoking, comorbidity, and final pathologic stage. RESULTS In propensity-matched pairs, adjusted hazard ratio for death did not differ significantly for primary MIE compared with neoadjuvant (hazard ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.60-1.16). Recurrence patterns were similar between groups and 65% of patients with IIb or greater pathologic stage received adjuvant therapy. Clinical staging was inaccurate in 37 out of 105 patients (35%) who underwent primary MIE (n = 18 upstaged and n = 19 downstaged). CONCLUSIONS Primary MIE followed by adjuvant chemotherapy guided by pathologic findings did not negatively influence survival and allowed for accurate staging compared with clinical staging. Our data suggest that primary MIE in patients with resectable EAC may be a reasonable approach, improving stage-based prognostication and potentially minimizing overtreatment in patients with early stage disease through accurate stage assignments. A randomized controlled trial testing this hypothesis is needed.", " A novel coronavirus (CoV), unlike previous typical human coronaviruses (HCoVs), was identified as causative agent for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). SARS first surfaced as a pandemic in late 2002 and originated in southern China. SARS-CoV rapidly spread to > 30 countries by 2003, infecting nearly 8,000 people and causing around 800 fatalities. After 10 years of silence, a 2012 report alarmed researchers about the emergence of a new strain of CoV causing SARS-like disease. AREAS COVERED To combat SARS, scientists applied for patents on various therapeutic agents, including small-molecule inhibitors targeting the essential proteases, helicase and other proteins of the virus, natural products, approved drugs, molecules binding to the virus, neutralizing antibodies, vaccines, anti-sense RNA, siRNA and ribozyme against SARS-CoV. In this article, the patents published from 2008 to the present for the new therapeutics that could potentially be used in the prophylaxis and treatment of SARS are reviewed. EXPERT OPINION The therapeutic interventions or prophylaxis discussed in this review seems to offer promising solutions to tackle SARS. Rather than being complacent about the results, we should envisage how to transform them into drug candidates that may be useful in combating SARS and related viral infections in the future.", "This article reviews the virology, history, pathology, epidemiology, clinical presentations, complications, radiology, laboratory testing, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of severe respiratory distress syndrome, with reference to documented outbreaks of the disease.", "Objective: To explore imaging characteristics of children with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on clinical data and chest CT images of 15 children diagnosed with 2019-nCoV infection. They were admitted to the Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen from January 16 to February 6, 2020. The distribution and morphology of pulmonary lesions on chest CT images were analyzed. Results: Among the 15 children, 5 were males and 10 females, aged from 4 to 14 years. Five of the 15 children were febrile and 10 were asymptomatic on the first visit. The first nasal or pharyngeal swab samples in all the 15 cases were positive for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid. For their first chest CT images, 6 patients had no lesions, while 9 patients had pulmonary inflammatory lesions. Seven cases had small nodular ground glass opacities and 2 cases had speckled ground glass opacities. After 3 to 5 days of treatment, 2019-nCoV nucleic acid in a second respiratory sample turned negative in 6 cases. Among them, chest CT images showed less lesions in 2 cases, no lesion in 3 cases, and no improvement in 1 case. The remaining 9 cases were still positive in a second nucleic acid test. Six patients showed similar chest CT inflammation, while 3 patients had new lesions, which were all small nodular ground glass opacities. Conclusions: The early chest CT images of children with 2019-nCoV infection are mostly small nodular ground glass opacities. The clinical symptoms of children with 2019-nCoV infection are nonspecific. Dynamic reexamination of chest CT and nucleic acid are important.", "AIM OF THE STUDY To address the value of continuous monitoring of bispectral index (BIS) to predict neurological outcome after cardiac arrest. METHODS In this prospective observational study in adult comatose patients treated by therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac arrest we measured bispectral index (BIS) during the first 24 hours of intensive care unit stay. A blinded neurological outcome assessment by cerebral performance category (CPC) was done 6 months after cardiac arrest. RESULTS Forty-six patients (48%) had a good neurological outcome at 6-month, as defined by a cerebral performance category (CPC) 1-2, and 50 patients (52%) had a poor neurological outcome (CPC 3-5). Over the 24h of monitoring, mean BIS values over time were higher in the good outcome group (38 \u00b1 9) compared to the poor outcome group (17 \u00b1 12) (p<0.001). Analysis of BIS recorded every 30 minutes provided an optimal prediction after 12.5h, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.89, a specificity of 89% and a sensitivity of 86% using a cut-off value of 23. With a specificity fixed at 100% (sensitivity 26%) the cut-off BIS value was 2.4 over the first 271 minutes. In multivariable analyses including clinical characteristics, mean BIS value over the first 12.5h was a predictor of neurological outcome (p = 6E-6) and provided a continuous net reclassification index of 1.28% (p = 4E-10) and an integrated discrimination improvement of 0.31 (p=1E-10). CONCLUSIONS Mean BIS value calculated over the first 12.5h after ICU admission potentially predicts 6-months neurological outcome after cardiac arrest.", "Respiratory complications are a common cause of morbidity and mortality in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Treatment of respiratory insufficiency with noninvasive ventilation (NIV) improves ALS patients' quality of life and survival. Evidence-based practice guidelines for the management of ALS patients recommend treatment of respiratory insufficiency with NIV as well as consideration of insufflation/exsufflation to improve clearance of airway secretions. Despite these recommendations respiratory therapies remain underused. In this review we provide a practical guide for the clinician to prescribe and manage respiratory therapies for the patient with ALS.", "OBJECTIVE. Because CT plays an important role in diagnosis, isolation, treatment, and effective evaluation of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), infection prevention and control management of CT examination rooms is important. CONCLUSION. We describe modifications to the CT examination process, strict disinfection of examination rooms, arrangement of waiting areas, and efforts to increase radiographers' awareness of personal protection made at our institution during the COVID-19 outbreak. In addition, we discuss the potential of using artificial intelligence in imaging patients with contagious diseases.", "PURPOSE Balloon-assisted coiling (BAC) has made the treatment of aneurysms with complex shape and broad neck possible, especially during the acute phase of hemorrhage. The authors present a prospective series of their preliminary experience with the TransForm occlusion balloon catheter (TOBC). METHODS Between September 2015 to February 2016 a total of 20 patients underwent endovascular treatment assisted by TOBC of which 19 had 20 untreated aneurysms and 1 patient harboring a meningioma was submitted to balloon test occlusion (BTO). The TOBC was used to perform BAC and BTO for the treatment of vasospasms and to cross the neck of giant aneurysms (anchor technique). All data regarding the feasibility and safety of treatment with the device were collected prospectively. RESULTS All patients completed treatment according to the modality previously chosen. The balloon was employed solely for remodeling in 17 patients, for anchor technique in 2, for both remodeling and vasospasm angioplasty in 1 and for BTO in 1 patient. The balloon could be navigated to the target aneurysm in all cases. Evaluation of postoperative anatomical results indicated total occlusion in 13 (72.2 %) aneurysms, neck remnants in 4 (22.2 %) and residual sac filling in 1 (5.5 %). There were two (9.5 %) complications related to treatment, all thromboembolic. No technical complications were observed. CONCLUSION The TOBC was shown to be safe and effective for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms with BAC. In addition, it was successfully employed to perform angioplasty for vasospasm and BTO. Finally, it was used in the balloon anchor technique for the first time.", " AND OBJECTIVES Standard techniques of laparoscopic access involve creating an abdominal wall defect and can result in complications. We describe the umbilical ring easy kannula access (UREKA) technique, evaluating safety and a decrease in complications related to port placement. METHODS UREKA is performed via a supra- or infraumbilical incision followed by circumferential dissection of the umbilical stalk. The umbilical skin is dissected free from the fascia, exposing the umbilical ring. Pneumoperitoneum is established either before or after placement of a dilating port through the open ring. We reviewed all laparoscopic procedures performed by one pediatric surgeon over 14 months using UREKA. RESULTS Ninety-four patients underwent laparoscopic surgery with initial port placement via UREKA. Appendectomy (n=57) was the most common procedure, followed by fundoplication (15) and cholecystectomy (10). No intestinal, solid organ, vascular, or bladder injuries related to port placement occurred. The only postoperative complication was a superficial wound infection in a 135-kg patient following cholecystectomy, treated successfully with oral antibiotics alone. CONCLUSION The umbilical ring persists to some degree in all pediatric patients and provides a safe portal of entry for laparoscopic surgery. UREKA has few complications and is a straightforward, reproducible technique for gaining initial laparoscopic access.", ": Antiviral drugs are administered in patients with severe COVID\u201019 respiratory syndrome, including those treated with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). Concomitant administration of antiviral agents has the potential to increase their plasma concentration. A series of patients managed in the Cremona Thrombosis Center were admitted at Cremona Hospital for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and started antiviral drugs without stopping DOAC therapy. DOAC plasma levels were measured in hospital and results compared with those recorded before hospitalization. METHODS: All consecutive patients on DOACs were candidates for administration of antiviral agents (lopinavir, ritonavir, or darunavir). Plasma samples for DOAC measurement were collected 2to 4 days after starting antiviral treatment, at 12 hours from the last dose intake in patients on dabigatran and apixaban, and at 24 hours in those on rivaroxaban and edoxaban. For each patient, C\u2010trough DOAC level, expressed as ng/mL, was compared with the one measured before hospitalization. RESULTS: Of the 1039 patients hospitalized between February 22 and March 15, 2020 with COVID\u201019 pneumonia and candidates for antiviral therapy, 32 were on treatment with a DOAC. DOAC was stopped in 20 and continued in the remaining 12. On average, C\u2010trough levels were 6.14 times higher during hospitalization than in the pre\u2010hospitalization period. CONCLUSION: DOAC patients treated with antiviral drugs show an alarming increase in DOAC plasma levels. In order to prevent bleeding complications, we believe that physicians should consider withholding DOACs from patients with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and replacing them with alternative parenteral antithrombotic strategies for as long as antiviral agents are deemed necessary and until discharge.", "Importance While most viral respiratory tract infections can be diagnosed clinically, clinicians frequently order tests to identify the specific offending virus. While there has been tremendous growth in the variety, availability, and sophistication of the types of respiratory viral tests, there may have been less critical thought and discussion among frontline clinicians about the clinical utility and specific indications for testing. We summarize the rationale historically used to support respiratory virus testing in children, with a review of the supporting evidence. We outline potential considerations and limitations of the various types of respiratory viral tests and suggest some clinical indications where viral testing may play an important role in clinical management. Observations The main value of testing for viruses in children who present with a respiratory tract infection is to differentiate between viral and bacterial infections, hopefully facilitating clinical decision making regarding further investigations and the need for antibiotics. We have highlighted commonly cited rationale used to support testing and the generally poor evidence on which to base this rationale. In addition, difficulties with interpretation of respiratory viral testing results include somewhat poor diagnostic test characteristics for some tests, uncertainty regarding true positives and causation of illness, delay in receiving the test result, and the incidence of concurrent bacterial infections or the presence of multiple viruses. We have given some examples of clinical scenarios where respiratory viral testing results could be expected to contribute to more appropriate clinical management decisions. Conclusions and Relevance It is not good enough to \"do\" just because we \"can.\" We suggest that for many healthy immune-competent children presenting with typical viral respiratory tract symptoms, the diagnosis can be made clinically, and frontline clinicians should think critically before automatically requesting a somewhat uncomfortable, expensive respiratory viral test, the result of which may not contribute to the child's treatment.", "WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Since the December 2019 discovery of several cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China, the infection has spread worldwide. Our aim is to report on the clinical characteristics, treatments and prognoses of COVID-19. METHODS: This was a retrospective, single-centre, case series of 136 patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 at Wuhan Third Hospital in Wuhan, China, between 28 January 2020 and 12 February 2020. The clinical characteristics, laboratory tests, treatment features and prognoses were summarized. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The 136 patients were divided into a moderate (M) group (n = 103, 75.7%) and a severe and critical (SC) group (n = 33, 24.3%). There were significant differences in the incidences of concomitant chronic medical illnesses (eg, hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular disease), fever, dry cough and dyspnoea among the two groups (P < .05). Compared with those in the M group, lymphocyte count (LYM) decreased significantly in the SC group, while the serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), creatinine (Cre), D-dimer, lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), myoglobin (MB) and troponin I (cTnl) increased significantly in the SC group (P < .05). The main therapeutic drugs were antivirals, antibiotics, glucocorticoids, immunomodulators, traditional Chinese medicine preparations and symptomatic support drugs. There were significant differences in the incidences of shock, myocardial injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and renal injury among the two groups (P < .05). Among the 136 patients, 99 (72.7%) were cured, 14 (10.3%) were transferred to other hospital and 23 (16.9%) died. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Elderly patients with chronic diseases are more likely to develop severe or critical COVID-19 with multiple organ damage or systemic injuries. The improvement of LYM and CRP may be associated with the prognoses of COVID-19. The combined use of three or more antiviral drugs is to be avoided. The combination of broad-spectrum antibacterial drugs is not recommended and the risk of drug-induced liver injury should be monitored. Throughout a patient's hospitalization, their treatment plan should be evaluated and adjusted according to their vital signs, clinical symptoms, laboratory tests and imaging changes. Patients should receive effective psychological counselling.", " Approximately 80,000 patients each year are admitted to U.K. hospitals with an acute stroke and are immobile. At least 10% will develop a proximal deep vein thrombosis in the first month and 1.5% a pulmonary embolus. Although hydration, antiplatelet treatment and early mobilisation may reduce the risk of deep vein thrombosis, there are currently no preventive strategies which have been clearly shown to be both effective and safe. Anticoagulation increases the risks of bleeding and compression stockings are ineffective. Systematic reviews of small randomized trials of intermittent pneumatic compression have shown that this reduces the risk of deep vein thrombosis in patients undergoing surgery, but that there are few data concerning its use after stroke. The CLOTS trial 3 aims to determine whether, compared with best medical care, best medical care plus intermittent pneumatic compression in immobile stroke patients reduces the risk of proximal deep vein thrombosis. METHODS/DESIGN CLOTS Trial 3 is a parallel group multicentre trial; with centralized randomisation (minimisation) to ensure allocation concealment. Over 80 centres in the U.K. will recruit 2800 immobile stroke patients within the first 3 days of their hospital admission. Patients will be allocated to best medical care or best medical care plus intermittent pneumatic compression. Ultrasonographers will perform a Compression Duplex Ultrasound Scan to detect deep vein thrombosis in each treatment group at about 7-10 days and 25-30 days. The primary outcome cluster includes symptomatic or asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis in the popliteal or femoral veins detected on either scan. Patients are then followed up by postal or telephone questionnaire at 6 months from randomisation to detect later symptomatic deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary emboli and to establish their functional outcome (Oxford handicap scale) and quality of life (EQ5D-3 L). The ultrasonographers performing the scans are blinded to treatment allocation, whereas the patients and caregivers are not. The trial has 90% power to detect a 4% absolute difference in risk of the primary outcome and includes a health economic analysis. DISCUSSION The trial started recruitment in Dec 2008 and will complete recruitment during 2012. It will report results in 2013. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER ISRCTN: ISRCTN93529999.", "PURPOSE Laparoscopic gastric resection cannot be easily applied for submucosal tumors near the esophagogastric junction (NEJ-SMTs). Furthermore, there have been no reports of single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) for NEJ-SMTs. We evaluated our laparoscopic surgical outcomes for NEJ-SMTs, including a newly introduced phase of SILS. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed a total of 18 patients diagnosed with NEJ-SMTs who underwent laparoscopic surgery between April 2002 and September 2013. RESULTS All patients underwent laparoscopic gastric resection without local complications and with a negative surgical margin, including 12 patients treated with conventional laparoscopic surgery (CLS) and six patients treated with SILS. The mean length of the operation was 184.3 \u00b1 52.3 min, and the mean blood loss was 19.2 \u00b1 17.7 mL. All patients underwent complete resection. There were no statistically significant differences between the CLS and SILS groups in terms of the surgical outcomes. CONCLUSION Despite this challenging location of the tumor, laparoscopic gastric resection for NEJ-SMTs is safe and feasible. Furthermore, SILS can provide a better cosmetic result, which can lead to better global patient satisfaction in carefully selected patients with NEJ-SMTs.", "OBJECTIVES Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) has been used as the first step of a staged malabsorptive procedure for high-risk patients. More recently SG was proposed as an stand alone procedure in the treatment of morbidly obese patients. The aim of this study is to analyze perioperative outcome of morbid obese patients after SG. METHODS 301 patients, 201 women and 100 men, undergoing SG were retrospectively analyzed. SG was performed by 17 surgeons all member of the Club Coelio. The mean BMI was 44.7kg/m2 (27.4-70.3 kg/m2). 34 patients (11.3%) of our series had SG as revisional surgery. These revisional procedures consisted of 32 conversions from gastric banding, 1 conversion from vertical gastroplasty (VBG) and 1 from transoral endoscopic gastroplasty. Among the 32 patients that had revisional SG after a gastric banding, 13 bands were removed at least 3 months before the revisional SG and 19 bands were removed during the SG procedure. Endpoints were perioperative morbidity and mortality and potential risk factors for complications, mainly per or postoperative bleeding or leakage. RESULTS Overall mortality was 0% and morbidity was 10.3%. Perioperative bleeding occurred in 10 patients (3.3%), leakage in 12 patients (4%) patients and stenosis in 3 patients (1%). The risk of leakage was significantly higher after revisional bariatric surgery and in case of gastric perforation during surgery (p = 0.0001). Previous gastric banding is also associated with a higher risk of postoperative bleeding (p = 0.0006). CONCLUSIONS SG can be safely performed but patients and surgeons must be aware of a higher risk of postoperative complications when SG is proposed as a revisional surgery.", "A position statement published by the Italian Society of Anesthesia Analgesia Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) is fostering a vibrant debate, crossed by deep fears. These are recommendations addressed to ICU doctors who must decide whether to implement intensive treatments for patients who need them to survive. Specifically, the reference is to the patients to whom the CoViD-19 epidemic has compromised respiratory capacity. We still do not have clear what positive criteria can help make clinical decisions in contexts of insufficient resources that force us to make choices.", "PURPOSE OF REVIEW Recent advances were made in the field of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS). Thoracic and lung ultrasound have become a rapid and accurate method of diagnosis of hypoxic diseases. The purpose of this article is to review the recent literature on POCUS, emphasizing on its use in the operating room. RECENT FINDINGS Many international critical care societies published guidelines on the use of ultrasound in the installation of central venous access. More recently, evidenced-based guidelines on the use of POC lung ultrasound were published. Lung ultrasound has shown its superiority over conventional chest radiography in the diagnosis of many disorders of significant importance in anesthesiology, particularly the pneumothorax. SUMMARY POC thoracic and lung ultrasound is used in many critical medicine fields. The aim of this review is to describe the basic lung ultrasound technique and the knowledge required in order to diagnose and treat the hypoxic patient. Emphasis is on disorder such as pleural effusion, alveolar interstitial disease, as well as pneumothorax, which is of particular importance in the field of anesthesiology.", ": Thymus transplantation is a promising strategy for the treatment of athymic complete DiGeorge syndrome (cDGS). METHODS: Twelve patients with cDGS underwent transplantation with allogeneic cultured thymus. OBJECTIVE: We sought to confirm and extend the results previously obtained in a single center. RESULTS: Two patients died of pre-existing viral infections without having thymopoiesis, and 1 late death occurred from autoimmune thrombocytopenia. One infant had septic shock shortly after transplantation, resulting in graft loss and the need for a second transplant. Evidence of thymopoiesis developed from 5 to 6 months after transplantation in 10 patients. Median circulating naive CD4 counts were 44 \u00d7 10(6)/L (range, 11-440 \u00d7 10(6)/L) and 200 \u00d7 10(6)/L (range, 5-310 \u00d7 10(6)/L) at 12 and 24 months after transplantation and T-cell receptor excision circles were 2,238/10(6) T cells (range, 320-8,807/10(6) T cells) and 4,184/10(6) T cells (range, 1,582-24,596/10(6) T cells). Counts did not usually reach normal levels for age, but patients were able to clear pre-existing infections and those acquired later. At a median of 49 months (range, 22-80 months), 8 have ceased prophylactic antimicrobials, and 5 have ceased immunoglobulin replacement. Histologic confirmation of thymopoiesis was seen in 7 of 11 patients undergoing biopsy of transplanted tissue, including 5 showing full maturation through to the terminal stage of Hassall body formation. Autoimmune regulator expression was also demonstrated. Autoimmune complications were seen in 7 of 12 patients. In 2 patients early transient autoimmune hemolysis settled after treatment and did not recur. The other 5 experienced ongoing autoimmune problems, including thyroiditis (3), hemolysis (1), thrombocytopenia (4), and neutropenia (1). CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the previous reports that thymus transplantation can reconstitute T cells in patients with cDGS but with frequent autoimmune complications in survivors.", "Every year, approximately 62,000 people with stroke and transient ischemic attack are treated in Canadian hospitals. The 2014 update of the Canadian Secondary Prevention of Stroke guideline is a comprehensive summary of current evidence-based recommendations for clinicians in a range of settings, who provide care to patients following stroke. Notable changes in this 5th edition include an emphasis on treating the highest risk patients who present within 48 h of symptom onset with transient or persistent motor or speech symptoms, who need to be transported to the closest emergency department with capacity for advanced stroke care; a recommendation for brain and vascular imaging (of the intra- and extracranial vessels) to be completed urgently using computed tomography/computed tomography angiography; prolonged cardiac monitoring for patients with suspective cardioembolic stroke but without evidence for atrial fibrillation on electrocardiogram or holter monitoring; and de-emphasizing the need for routine echocardiogram. The Canadian Stroke Best Practice Recommendations include a range of supporting materials such as implementation resources to facilitate the adoption of evidence to practice, and related performance measures to enable monitoring of uptake and effectiveness of the recommendations using a standardized approach. The guidelines further emphasize the need for a systems approach to stroke care, involving an interprofessional team, with access to specialists regardless of patient location, and the need to overcome geographical barriers to ensure equity in access within a universal health-care system.", "Objective: To explore imaging characteristics of children with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on clinical data and chest CT images of 15 children diagnosed with 2019-nCoV infection. They were admitted to the Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen from January 16 to February 6, 2020. The distribution and morphology of pulmonary lesions on chest CT images were analyzed. Results: Among the 15 children, 5 were males and 10 females, aged from 4 to 14 years. Five of the 15 children were febrile and 10 were asymptomatic on the first visit. The first nasal or pharyngeal swab samples in all the 15 cases were positive for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid. For their first chest CT images, 6 patients had no lesions, while 9 patients had pulmonary inflammatory lesions. Seven cases had small nodular ground glass opacities and 2 cases had speckled ground glass opacities. After 3 to 5 days of treatment, 2019-nCoV nucleic acid in a second respiratory sample turned negative in 6 cases. Among them, chest CT images showed less lesions in 2 cases, no lesion in 3 cases, and no improvement in 1 case. The remaining 9 cases were still positive in a second nucleic acid test. Six patients showed similar chest CT inflammation, while 3 patients had new lesions, which were all small nodular ground glass opacities. Conclusions: The early chest CT images of children with 2019-nCoV infection are mostly small nodular ground glass opacities. The clinical symptoms of children with 2019-nCoV infection are nonspecific. Dynamic reexamination of chest CT and nucleic acid are important.", "Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) causes significant disability and mortality. Current guidelines for CVT management support the initial use of unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin followed by longer-term oral vitamin K antagonist (VKA). There has been increasing, albeit limited, evidence for the use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) as an alternative to VKA. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that compared the safety and efficacy of DOACs to VKA in treating CVT. A comprehensive literature search was carried out in Medline, Embase and Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register using a suitable keyword/MeSH term search strategy. All studies published in English comparing outcomes of patients with CVT treated with DOAC or VKA were included. In total, 6 studies (5 observational studies and 1 randomized clinical trial) comprising 412 patients (age range 16-83 years) were analyzed. DOAC was used in 151 patients, while 261 received VKA. The follow-up period was 3-11 months. The efficacy of DOACs was comparable with VKA in terms of partial or full thrombus recanalization (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.89-1.16) and excellent functional recovery with modified Rankin scale < 2 (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.93-1.13). Patients treated with DOAC developed lower major bleeding events when compared to VKA, although this did not reach statistical significance (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.12-1.59). We provide preliminary evidence to support DOAC as effective and safe alternatives to VKA in CVT treatment. We await the results of upcoming randomized trials to further support our results and validate the use of DOAC.", "Modification of titanium oxide by multiphase anodic spark deposition (ASD) has the potential to increase bioactivity and hasten osseointegration and biological fixation in uncemented arthroplasty. This study assessed the in vivo performance of control (Ti), plasma-sprayed HA-coated (TiHA) and ASD (Biospark) treated (TiAn) porous titanium implants with a solid core using a standard uncemented implant fixation sheep model. Cortical interfacial shear-strength and bone ingrowth in cortical and cancellous sites were quantified following 12 weeks in situ. Ultimate shear-strength for the Ti, TiHA and TiAn coatings was 33\u00b19.5, 35.4\u00b18.4 and 33.8\u00b17.8 MPa, respectively, which was limited by coating delamination. ASD treatment was associated with significantly higher mean bone ingrowth at both sites. These results support the osteoconductive potential of the BioSpark treatment of porous titanium.", "Skin graft successful depends on reduction of local inflammation evoked by the surgical lesion and efficient neovascularization to nutrition the graft. It has been shown that N-terminal portion of the Annexin A1 protein (AnxA1) with its anti-inflammatory properties induces epithelial mucosa repair and presents potential therapeutic approaches. The role of AnxA1 on wound healing has not been explored and we investigated in this study the effect of the peptide Ac2-26 (N-terminal AnxA1 peptide Ac2-26; AnxA12-26) on heterologous skin scaffolds transplantation in BALB/c mice, focusing on inflammation and angiogenesis. Treatment with AnxA12-26, once a day, from day 3-60 after scaffold implantation improved the take of the implant, induced vessels formation, enhanced gene and protein levels of the vascular growth factor-A (VEGF-A) and fibroblast influx into allograft tissue. It also decreased pro- while increasing anti-inflammatory cytokines. The pro-angiogenic activity of AnxA12-26 was corroborated by topical application of AnxA12-26 on the subcutaneous tissue of mice. Moreover, treatment of human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVECs) with AnxA12-26 improved proliferation, shortened cycle, increased migration and actin polymerization similarly to those evoked by VEGF-A. The peptide treatment instead only potentiated the tube formation induced by VEGF-A. Collectively, our data showed that AnxA12-26 treatment favors the tissue regeneration after skin grafting by avoiding exacerbated inflammation and improving the angiogenesis process.", "The objective of our work is to demonstrate in a large cohort of patients with cricotracheal stenosis that resection of long airway segments could be performed with no increased risk of postoperative complications. A consecutive series of patients getting cervical segmental cricotracheal resection (CTR) were reviewed. The typical segmental tracheal resection technique has been modified to accommodate long segment removal. Modifications include using trachea to enable the reconstruction of the larynx itself as well as the placement of a \"laryngosternopexy\" stitch between the thyroid lamina and the sternoclavicular ligament designed to take all of the tension off the anastomosis and to prevent inadvertent head extension. Anastomosis was performed by using continuous barbed sutures that allowed gradual approximation of the proximal and distal segments even in the presence of a large segmental airway resection defect that could involve as much as half of the tracheal length. Thirty-eight patients were treated. Primary etiologies of cricotracheal stenosis were prolonged intubation and tracheostomy. All had Grade III-IV stenosis. Only one patient had postoperative revision surgery for anastomosis-based disease. All patients with tracheostomy (n = 29) were successfully decannulated. Complications occurred in five patients. These included acute airway obstruction requiring emergency tracheostomy through the anastomosis, a tracheal dehiscence, laryngeal edema with airway obstruction, superficial wound infections, neck abscesses, and transient vocal cord immobility. Modified cricotracheal resection has comparable results to traditional techniques and may offer advantages such as resection of long tracheal segments without any increase in the risk of post-anastomosis airway leak.", "In our previous study, the remarkable analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects of the combination of sodium ferulate (SF) and oxymatrine (OMT) had been found. In this study, we investigated the effect of the combination of SF and OMT on acute lung injury using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) mouse model. The cell counting and the protein concentration in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were measured. The animal lung edema degree was evaluated by wet/dry weight (W/D) ratio. The superoxidase dismutase (SOD) activity and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity was assayed by SOD and MPO kits, respectively. The levels of inflammatory mediators including C-reactive protein (CRP) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. The data showed that treatment with the combination of SF and OMT markedly attenuated inflammatory cell numbers and protein concentration in the BALF and improved SOD activity and inhibited MPO activity compared to LPS group. Moreover, the combination significantly inhibited the production of CRP and TNF-\u03b1 in lung homogenate. The histological changes of the lungs were also more significantly improved by the combination. At the same dose, the obvious protective effect was not found in SF or OMT-treated alone group except that the protein concentration slightly decreased in SF group. The results indicated that the combination SF and OMT had a protective effect on LPS-induced ALI in mice, and the effect was much better than that of SF or OMT used alone.", "Importance Data are lacking whether patients with hypertension who are taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have increased severity or risk of mortality during hospitalization for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Objective To investigate the association between ACEIs/ARBs and severity of illness and mortality in patients with hypertension hospitalized for COVID-19 infection. Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective, single-center case series of the 1178 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infections at the Central Hospital of Wuhan, China, from January 15 to March 15, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures COVID-19 was confirmed by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and epidemiologic, clinical, radiologic, laboratory, and drug therapy data were analyzed in all patients. The percentage of patients with hypertension taking ACEIs/ARBs was compared between those with severe vs nonsevere illness and between survivors vs nonsurvivors. Results Of the 1178 patients with COVID-19, the median age was 55.5 years (interquartile range, 38-67 years) and 545 (46.3%) were men. The overall in-hospital mortality was 11.0%. There were 362 patients with hypertension (30.7% of the total group; median age, 66.0 years [interquartile range, 59-73 years]; 189 [52.2%] were men), of whom 115 (31.8%) were taking ACEI/ARBs. The in-hospital mortality in the patients with hypertension was 21.3%. The percentage of patients with hypertension taking ACEIs/ARBs did not differ between those with severe and nonsevere infections (32.9% vs 30.7%; P = .65) nor did it differ between nonsurvivors and survivors (27.3% vs 33.0%; P = .34). Similar findings were observed when data were analyzed for patients taking ACEIs and those taking ARBs. Conclusions and Relevance This study provides clinical data on the association between ACEIs/ARBs and outcomes in patients with hypertension hospitalized with COVID-19 infections, suggesting that ACEIs/ARBs are not associated with the severity or mortality of COVID-19 in such patients. These data support current guidelines and societal recommendations for treating hypertension during the COVID-19 pandemic.", "Spinal subdural hematoma (SSDH) following spine surgery is an extremely rare condition, with only three cases being reported in the literature. Unintended durotomy has been associated with SSDH due to alterations of pressures in the dural compartments. The objective of the present report was to report two rare cases of acute SSDH developed after lumbar decompressive surgery. In one of the patients, the diagnosis of SSDH was followed by urgent hematoma evacuation via durotomy due to the patient's worsening neurological symptoms. In the second patient, the SSDH was treated conservatively due to the absence of severe or progressive motor or sensory deficits. In conclusion, emergency evacuation via durotomy is the treatment of choice for patients with SSDH and neurologic impairment. Conservative management may be indicated in selected cases with absent motor and sensory deficits.", "AIM To compare outcomes of modified coronally advanced tunnel technique (MCAT) combined with either collagen matrix (CM) or subepithelial connective tissue graft (SCTG) in the treatment of Miller class I and II multiple gingival recessions in the mandible. MATERIALS AND METHODS The study encompassed 91 recessions in 29 patients for whom MCAT was combined with CM on one side of the mandible and SCTG on the contralateral one. The following clinical parameters were measured: gingival recession height (GR) and width (RW), probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), width of keratinized tissue (KT), gingival thickness (GT), mean (MRC) and complete root coverage (CRC) and Root Coverage Esthetic Score (RES). RESULTS The MRC proportions on the CM- and SCTG-treated sides were 53.20% and 83.10%, respectively. CRC was achieved in 9 out of 45 (20%) gingival defects treated with CM and 31 out of 46 (67%) treated with SCTG. There were statistically significant differences in MRC, CRC, GR, RW, KT, GT and RES between CM- and CTG-treated sides. CONCLUSIONS Modified coronally advanced tunnel technique leads to reduction in gingival recession both when combined CM and SCTG, of which the latter is more efficient as far as root coverage and aesthetic parameters are concerned.", "The number of infectious disease outbreaks and the number of unique pathogens responsible have significantly increased since the 1980s. HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM) are a vulnerable population with regards to the introduction, spread and clinical consequences of (newly introduced) STIs. After the introduction of combination antiretroviral treatment (cART), the incidence of sexually acquired hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and human papillomavirus (HPV)-induced anal cancers have significantly increased among HIV-positive MSM. The introduction and expansion of HCV is the result of increased sexual risk behaviour and sexually acquired mucosal trauma within large interconnected networks of HIV-positive MSM in particular. With the availability of cART, postexposure and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PEP and PrEP) and direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) for HCV, less concern for HIV and HCV might require a new approach to develop effective behavioural intervention strategies among MSM. The marked rise in HPV-induced anal cancers can be ascribed to the long-term immunologic defects in an ageing population affected by HIV. More evidence with regards to effective treatment options for anal dysplastic lesions and the usefulness of anal malignancy screening programmes is urgently needed. Most anal cancers in the future generation of HIV-positive MSM could be prevented with the inclusion of boys in addition to girls in current HPV vaccination programmes.", "OBJECTIVE To determine the frequency of enteropathogens in dogs entering an animal shelter with normal feces or diarrhea. DESIGN Cross-sectional study. ANIMALS 100 dogs evaluated at an open-admission municipal animal shelter in Florida. PROCEDURES Fecal samples were collected within 24 hours after admission from 50 dogs with normal feces and 50 dogs with diarrhea. Feces were tested by fecal flotation, antigen testing, PCR assay, and electron microscopy for selected enteropathogens. RESULTS 13 enteropathogens were identified. Dogs with diarrhea were significantly more likely to be infected with \u2265 1 enteropathogens (96%) than were dogs with normal feces (78%). Only Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin A gene was significantly more common in dogs with diarrhea (64%) than in dogs with normal feces (40%). Other enteropathogens identified in dogs with and without diarrhea included hookworms (58% and 48%, respectively), Giardia spp (22% and 16%, respectively), canine enteric coronavirus (2% and 18%, respectively), whipworms (12% and 8%, respectively), Cryptosporidium spp (12% and 2%, respectively), ascarids (8% and 8%, respectively), Salmonella spp (2% and 6%, respectively), Cystoisospora spp (2% and 4%, respectively), canine distemper virus (8% and 0%, respectively), Dipylidium caninum (2% and 2%, respectively), canine parvovirus (2% and 2%, respectively), and rotavirus (2% and 0%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Dogs entered the shelter with a variety of enteropathogens, many of which are pathogenic or zoonotic. Most infections were not associated with diarrhea or any specific dog characteristics, making it difficult to predict the risk of infection for individual animals. Guidelines for preventive measures and empirical treatments that are logistically and financially feasible for use in shelters should be developed for control of the most common and important enteropathogens.", "PURPOSE Recent meta-analyses have shown reduced re-rupture rates for the surgical management of Achilles ruptures. However, percutaneous repair has been demonstrated to lead to improved function and patient satisfaction but greater complications than open repair. In the current economic climate, it is reasonable to consider the financial cost of rupture management for both the patient and the provider. The cost-effectiveness of operative treatment of ruptures of the Achilles tendon was determined based upon theatre occupancy, clinic attendance and cast changes, operative complications and functional assessment score. METHODS The cost-effectiveness of the surgical management of Achilles tendon ruptures between 2005 and 2011 in our unit was audited by comparing 49 patients receiving percutaneous repair to 35 patients whom had open repairs. RESULTS There was no significant difference in complications between the two surgical techniques: (Open vs. Percutaneous) overall rates 14.3 versus 10.4 %: infection; 2.7 versus 2.0 %, transient sural nerve damage: 5.6 versus 8.1 %, wound breakdown: 2.8 versus 0.0 %, re-rupture: 2.8 versus 2.0 %. Achilles Total Rupture Scores (ATRS) were comparable [Open 89 (65-100) at 49 months vs. Percutaneous 88.8 (33-100) at 12 months (n.s.)]. Theatre occupancy (P < 0.00) and hospital stay (P < 0.00) were significantly longer with open repair [43 min (26-70) and 2.9 days (0-4)] compared to percutaneous repair [15 min (12-43) and 1.2 days (0-2)]. Excluding the costs of running the operating theatre, we have estimated the costs of surgery for open repair to be \u00a3 935 and percutaneous repair to be \u00a3 574. CONCLUSIONS This study suggests that percutaneous repair of the Achilles tendon resulted in reduced costs and yet had comparable outcome and complications rates to open repair in surgical management of the Achilles tendon. Percutaneous repair should be considered as the primary method of cost-effective surgical management of Achilles tendon rupture.", " AND PURPOSE To evaluate the frequency and outcome of haemorrhagic transformation (HT) after ischaemic stroke in patients treated with non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs). METHODS Patients with stroke on treatment with a NOAC were prospectively enrolled in this multicentre observational study between February 2012 and 2015. Brain imaging at admission and follow-up imaging until day 7 were reviewed for HT. Functional outcome was assessed by the modified Rankin scale (mRS) before the index event, at discharge, and at 3-months. RESULTS 231 patients without recanalisation therapy (no-RT), and 32 patients with RT were eligible for analysis. Any HT was present at admission in 9/231 no-RT patients (3.9%, 95% CI 2.0 to 7.3) and in none of the patients with RT. In patients with follow-up imaging (no-RT, n=129, and RT, n=32), HT was present in 14.0% (no-RT; 95% CI, 8.9 to 21.1), and 40.6% (RT, 95% CI, 25.5 to 57.8), respectively. After adjustment for stroke severity, this difference between the no-RT and RT groups became non-significant. Symptomatic ICH was observed in 1 patient per group. HT was not associated with unfavourable outcome (mRS 3-6) at 3-months in multivariable analysis. Resumption of OAC after stroke was delayed in patients with HT compared to those without (15 d [IQR, 5-26] vs. 1 d [0-4], P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS The frequency and severity of HT after stroke on NOAC appears similar to previous reports for vitamin K antagonists and no anticoagulation. Whether asymptomatic HT should delay resumption of preventive anticoagulation requires further investigation.", "Following escape into the cytoplasm of host cells, Burkholderia pseudomallei and the related species Burkholderia thailandensis employ the type VI secretion system 5 (T6SS-5) to induce plasma membrane fusion with an adjacent host cell. This process leads to the formation of multinucleated giant cells and facilitates bacterial access to an uninfected host cell in a direct manner. Despite its importance in virulence, the mechanism of the T6SS-5 and the role of host cell factors in cell-cell fusion remain elusive. To date, the T6SS-5 is the only system of bacterial origin known to induce host-cell fusion. To gain insight into the nature of T6SS-5-stimulated membrane fusion, we investigated the contribution of cholesterol and proteins exposed on the host cell surface, which were shown to be critically involved in virus-mediated giant cell formation. In particular, we analyzed the effect of host cell surface protein and cholesterol depletion on the formation of multinucleated giant cells induced by B. thailandensis. Acute protease treatment of RAW264.7 macrophages during infection with B. thailandensis followed by agarose overlay assays revealed a strong reduction in the number of cell-cell fusions compared with EDTA treated cells. Similarly, proteolytic treatment of specifically infected donor cells or uninfected recipient cells significantly decreased multinucleated giant cell formation. Furthermore, modulating host cell cholesterol content by acute cholesterol depletion from cellular membranes by methyl- \u03b2-cyclodextrin treatment or exogenous addition of cholesterol impaired the ability of B. thailandensis to induce cell-cell fusions. The requirement of physiological cholesterol levels suggests that the membrane organization or mechanical properties of the lipid bilayer influence the fusion process. Altogether, our data suggest that membrane fusion induced by B. pseudomallei and B. thailandensis involves a complex interplay between the T6SS-5 and the host cell.", "In our previous study, the remarkable analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects of the combination of sodium ferulate (SF) and oxymatrine (OMT) had been found. In this study, we investigated the effect of the combination of SF and OMT on acute lung injury using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) mouse model. The cell counting and the protein concentration in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were measured. The animal lung edema degree was evaluated by wet/dry weight (W/D) ratio. The superoxidase dismutase (SOD) activity and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity was assayed by SOD and MPO kits, respectively. The levels of inflammatory mediators including C-reactive protein (CRP) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. The data showed that treatment with the combination of SF and OMT markedly attenuated inflammatory cell numbers and protein concentration in the BALF and improved SOD activity and inhibited MPO activity compared to LPS group. Moreover, the combination significantly inhibited the production of CRP and TNF-\u03b1 in lung homogenate. The histological changes of the lungs were also more significantly improved by the combination. At the same dose, the obvious protective effect was not found in SF or OMT-treated alone group except that the protein concentration slightly decreased in SF group. The results indicated that the combination SF and OMT had a protective effect on LPS-induced ALI in mice, and the effect was much better than that of SF or OMT used alone.", " AND HYPOTHESIS Sacral colpopexy/hysteropexy is a well-established approach to vaginal apex support and was the first technique used to treat pelvic organ prolapse (POP) with robotic assistance. However, dissection at the level of the promontory may be difficult, especially in obese patients, and associated with rare but potential serious morbidity such as life-threatening vascular injury. In an attempt to avoid this risk, we describe a new robotic approach for POP repair with lateral suspension. METHODS From March 2012 through June 2013, ten patients with symptomatic anterior vaginal wall and uterine prolapse were operated by a single surgeon. The video presents the different steps of robotically assisted laparoscopic repair of POP by lateral suspension with mesh and uterine conservation using da Vinci S or Si system. RESULTS POP repair was successfully completed in all ten patients without any perioperative or postoperative complication. CONCLUSION Robotically assisted laparoscopic repair of POP by lateral suspension with mesh is a novel and feasible technique with promising short-term results. It may have several theoretical advantages over sacral colpopexy/hysteropexy and may represent an alternative in cases of difficult dissection of the promontory.", "A lack of surveillance and diagnostics for zoonotic diseases in rural human clinics limits clinical awareness of these diseases. We assessed the prevalence of nine zoonotic pathogens in a pastoral, low-income, HIV-endemic community bordering wildlife reserves in South Africa. Two groups of participants were included: malaria-negative acute febrile illness (AFI) patients, called febrilers, at three clinics (n = 74) and second, farmers, herders, and veterinary staff found at five government cattle dip-tanks, called dip-tanksters (n = 64). Blood samples were tested using one PCR (Bartonella spp.) and eight antibody-ELISAs, and questionnaires were conducted to assess risk factors. Seventy-seven percent of febrilers and 98% of dip-tanksters had at least one positive test. Bartonella spp. (PCR 9.5%), spotted fever group (SFG) Rickettsia spp. (IgM 24.1%), Coxiella burnetii. (IgM 2.3%), and Leptospira spp. (IgM 6.8%) were present in febrilers and could have been the cause of their fever. Dip-tanksters and febrilers had evidence of past infection to Rickettsia spp. (IgG 92.2% and 63.4%, respectively) and C. burnetii (IgG 60.9% and 37.8%, respectively). No Brucella infection or current Bartonella infection was found in the dip-tanksters, although they had higher levels of recent exposure to Leptospira spp. (IgM 21.9%) compared to the febrilers. Low levels of West Nile and Sindbis, and no Rift Valley fever virus exposure were found in either groups. The only risk factor found to be significant was attending dip-tanks in febrilers for Q fever (p = 0.007). Amoxicillin is the local standard treatment for AFI, but would not be effective for Bartonella spp. infections, SFG rickettsiosis, Q fever infections, or the viral infections. There is a need to revise AFI treatment algorithms, educate medical and veterinary staff about these pathogens, especially SFG rickettsiosis and Q fever, support disease surveillance systems, and inform the population about reducing tick and surface water contact.", " Symptomatic portal or splenic vein thrombosis (PSVT) is a rare but potentially lethal complication of laparoscopic splenectomy (LS). While routine postoperative duplex ultrasound surveillance can be used for early detection, the optimal timing is unknown. The aim of this study is to investigate the incidence and progression of asymptomatic PSVT 1 week and 1 month after LS. METHODS Consecutive patients scheduled for LS for hematologic disease participated in this study. Patients underwent surveillance for PSVT using duplex ultrasonography 1 week and 1 month postoperatively. RESULTS 43 of 48 patients planning to undergo LS in the study period were enrolled, with 3 subsequently excluded, leaving 40 for further analysis. The indications for LS were benign disease in 31 [19 had immune thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP)] and malignant disease in 9. A hand-assisted technique was used in 12 cases. PSVT was diagnosed in 9/40 patients (22.5%). Seven (77.8%) were diagnosed by 1 week with ultrasound, of whom one had mild symptoms (fever and diarrhea). After anticoagulation, subsequent ultrasounds showed resolution or improvement in all seven patients. Thirty-three patients had a normal ultrasound result at 1 week. One of these patients also had a computed tomography (CT) scan that found a PSVT not seen on ultrasound. Twenty-seven patients returned for follow-up after normal 1-week imaging: 26 patients had an ultrasound at 1 month, with no new PSVT found. One additional patient did not return for subsequent ultrasound until 2 months later, when a new distal SVT was found; ultrasound at 6 months showed complete resolution without treatment. CONCLUSION The 1-week incidence of PSVT after LS was 8/40 (20%). The high incidence justifies ultrasonographic screening on postoperative day 7. If asymptomatic PSVT has not developed at this time, it is unlikely to develop by 1 month, and subsequent screening ultrasound at 1 month is not required.", "PURPOSE To retrospectively evaluate radiofrequency (RF) ablation of lung tumors performed via the transosseous approach. MATERIALS AND METHODS Twelve lung tumors (mean diameter, 1.0 cm; range, 0.4-1.6 cm) in 12 patients were treated by RF ablation via a transscapular and/or transrib route with the use of a bone biopsy needle under computed tomographic fluoroscopy guidance. Therapeutic outcomes evaluated included feasibility, safety, and local efficacy. Complications were assessed based on the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. RESULTS The transosseous route was successfully employed in all patients, and the electrode was successfully advanced into all tumors with this approach. The mean distance of penetrated bone was 0.57 cm (range, 0.19-1.16 cm). Complications occurred in eight RF ablation sessions, including six grade 1 events (two cases of pneumothorax and one case each of asymptomatic rib fracture 6 mo after treatment, neuralgia, pulmonary hemorrhage, and hemothorax), two grade 2 events (pneumonia and high fever), and one grade 3 event (pneumothorax requiring pleurodesis). No adverse events of grade \u2265 4 occurred. The mean and median tumor follow-up periods were 19.5 and 15.2 mo (range, 3.0-41.5 mo). Local progression occurred in two cases at 3 and 12 mo after treatment and was successfully treated with a second RF ablation procedure. The technique efficacy rates were 91.7% at 6 mo, 81.5% at 1 y, and 81.5% at 2 y. CONCLUSIONS The transosseous approach was feasible in computed tomographic fluoroscopy-guided RF ablation of select lung tumors when no other option was available.", "Introduction Intravenous thrombolysis is the treatment of choice in patients presenting with high- and intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism. The role of percutaneous mechanical pulmonary thrombectomy (PMPT) is not fully established, although selected patients can be managed with this method. Aim This open-label single-centre prospective pilot study was aimed at assessing the feasibility of PMPT for the treatment of severe pulmonary embolism in a Polish hospital. We also evaluated the safety and efficacy of such management. Material and methods We managed 7 patients, aged 52.7 \u00b116.6 years, presenting with high- and intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism (4 patients with class 5 and one patient with class 4 of the Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index), with occlusion of at least 2 lobar arteries and contraindications for thrombolysis. Percutaneous mechanical pulmonary thrombectomy was performed using the AngioJet system. Results It was possible to introduce the thrombectomy system to the pulmonary arteries in all patients. The procedure was successful in 6 patients (technical success rate: 85.7%). Two (28.6%) patients died during the hospital stay, one patient with unsuccessful thrombectomy and the other due to pneumonia. In all survivors control echocardiography demonstrated normalised function of the right ventricle. Also, dyspnoea disappeared and blood gas parameters normalised. There was no recurrent thromboembolism during 3-14 months of follow-up. Conclusions In the Polish setting, in selected patients, management of high- and intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism with PMPT is technically feasible. Such treatment is relatively safe and effective. It can be an alternative to standard management, especially in patients with contraindications for fibrinolysis or surgical embolectomy.", "PURPOSE OF REVIEW To examine the type and risk of infections in humans and mice deficient in proinflammatory cytokines. Naturally occurring or manipulated genetic defects of tumor necrosis factor, interleukins-1, -6, -12, and -15, and interferon-gamma are examined for their increased susceptibility to, or protection from, infection. RECENT FINDINGS Interleukin-12p40 and interferon-gamma-blockers may lead to increased incidence of infections with intracellular bacteria, parasites, and fungi. In addition, we may see viral infections with interferon-gamma-blockers. Increased risk of infections is unlikely with either interleukin-1- or interleukin-15-blockers. Interleukin-6-blockers may lead to increased risk of infection with extracellular bacteria, viruses, parasites and fungi. SUMMARY In tumor necrosis factor knockout mice, increased susceptibility to pathogens are reported that are normally controlled by granuloma formation. In patients treated with tumor necrosis factor-blockers, a two-fold increase of granulomatous infections, predominantly reactivation of latent tuberculosis, is found. The infections detected in tumor necrosis factor knockout mice were accurate for predicting the infections observed when using tumor necrosis factor-blockers. If a similar correlation exists for other cytokines, the use of interferon-gamma and interleukin-12p40 blockers, and possibly interleukin-6 blockers, will lead to an increased risk for severe infections. Care should be taken when new cytokine blockers/antagonists are introduced.", " Drug-coated balloons (DCBs) have shown promise in improving the outcomes for patients with peripheral artery disease. We compared a paclitaxel-coated balloon with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) for the treatment of symptomatic superficial femoral and popliteal artery disease. METHODS AND RESULTS The IN.PACT SFA Trial is a prospective, multicenter, single-blinded, randomized trial in which 331 patients with intermittent claudication or ischemic rest pain attributable to superficial femoral and popliteal peripheral artery disease were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to treatment with DCB or PTA. The primary efficacy end point was primary patency, defined as freedom from restenosis or clinically driven target lesion revascularization at 12 months. Baseline characteristics were similar between the 2 groups. Mean lesion length and the percentage of total occlusions for the DCB and PTA arms were 8.94 \u00b1 4.89 and 8.81 \u00b1 5.12 cm (P=0.82) and 25.8% and 19.5% (P=0.22), respectively. DCB resulted in higher primary patency versus PTA (82.2% versus 52.4%; P<0.001). The rate of clinically driven target lesion revascularization was 2.4% in the DCB arm in comparison with 20.6% in the PTA arm (P<0.001). There was a low rate of vessel thrombosis in both arms (1.4% after DCB and 3.7% after PTA [P=0.10]). There were no device- or procedure-related deaths and no major amputations. CONCLUSIONS In this prospective, multicenter, randomized trial, DCB was superior to PTA and had a favorable safety profile for the treatment of patients with symptomatic femoropopliteal peripheral artery disease.

We review recent studies dealing with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in kidney disease and hypertension, and discuss the potential therapeutic benefit of increasing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 activity in the treatment of these diseases. RECENT FINDINGS In glomeruli from diabetic mice, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 expression is downregulated, and pharmacological inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 leads to worsening of albuminuria, increased mesangial matrix deposition and fibronectin expression. The deletion of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 gene in mice leads to worsening of angiotensin II-induced hypertension and has also been shown to cause glomerulosclerosis in aging male mice. SUMMARY Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a key enzyme in the renin-angiotensin system that favors the degradation of angiotensin I and angiotensin II. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 inhibition by pharmacological means and by genetic deletion worsens kidney disease in diabetic mice. Strategies geared to increasing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 activity may provide a novel therapeutic target within the renin-angiotensin system by enhancing angiotensin II degradation that may complement the current approach of inhibiting angiotensin II formation and action. Amplifying angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 activity may have a potential therapeutic role for kidney disease and hypertension.", "Among the different materials used as protheses for the treatment of Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (e-PTFE) plays a leading role owing to its mechanical properties as explained in the first part of this review. However, this material is poorly cell adhesive, which is expected for its contact on the abdominal face, but should display specific tissue adhesion on its thoracic exposed faced. A side specific functionalization method is hence required. The deposition of a nanosized polydopamine film on PTFE is known to be possible but immersion of the e-PTFE membrane in an aerated dopamine solution leads to a functionalization not only on both faces of the membrane but also in its porous volume. The fact that polydopamine also forms at the water/air interface has allowed to transfer a polydopamine film on only one face of the e-PTFE membrane. The deposition method and applications of such Janus like membranes are reviewed in the second part of the review.", "Ablative therapies have been utilized with increasing frequency for the treatment of Barrett's esophagus with and without dysplasia. Multiple modalities are available for topical ablation of the esophagus, but radiofrequency ablation (RFA) remains the most commonly used. There have been significant advances in technique since the introduction of RFA. The aim of this paper is to review the indications, techniques, outcomes, and most common complications following esophageal ablation with RFA.", " & OBJECTIVES: This article examines whether women are less prone than men to Covid-19 infections and their complications. DATA SOURCES: We reviewed available databases and searched systematically for publications. To be taken into account, data had to be broken down by gender. There was no study evaluation nor quantification synthesis, due to the large heterogeneity of the studies. Nineteen databases were selected. 73 publications were considered and 33 were selected, to which 12 more were added. RESULTS: Globally, the proportion of men and women who tested positive is comparable. However, men are about 60% more likely to be severely ill or to die from the complications of Covid-19 than are women. LIMITATIONS: The study was hampered by a large heterogeneity in testing and reporting of the data. CONCLUSIONS: Although in the pandemic men die more frequently than women from Covid-19, it is not clear whether this is due to biological differences between men and women, differences in behavioral habits, or differences in the rates of co-morbidities. IMPLICATIONS OF KEY FINDINGS: Countries and studies should report their data by age, gender and co-morbidities. This may have implications in terms of vaccination strategies, the choice of treatments and future consequences for long-term health issues concerning gender equality.", "Leishmaniases are vector-borne diseases for which no vaccine exists. These diseases are caused by the Leishmania species complex. Activation of the CD8+ T cell is crucial for protection against intracellular pathogens, and peptide antigens are attractive strategies for the precise activation of CD8+ T in vaccine development against intracellular infections. The traditional approach to mine the epitopes is an arduous task. However, with the advent of immunoinformatics, in silico epitope prediction tools are available to expedite epitope identification. In this study, we employ different immunoinformatics tools to predict CD8+ T cell specific 9 mer epitopes presented by HLA-A*02 and HLA-B40 within the highly conserved 3'-ectonucleotidase of Leishmania donovani. We identify five promiscuous epitopes, which have no homologs in humans, theoretically cover 85% of the world's population and are highly conserved (100%) among Leishmania species. Presentation of selected peptides was confirmed by T2 cell line based HLA-stabilization assay, and three of them were found to be strong binders. The in vitro peptide stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from cured HLA-A02+ visceral leishmaniasis (VL) subjects produced significantly higher IFN-\u03b3, IL-2 and IL-12 compared to no peptide control healthy subjects. Further, CD8+ cells from treated VL subjects produced significantly higher intracellular IFN-\u03b3, lymphocyte proliferation and cytotoxic activity against selected peptides from the PBMCs of treated HLA-A02+ VL subjects. Thus, the CD8+ T cell specific epitopes shown in this study will speed up the development of polytope vaccines for leishmaniasis.", "Obesity is considered a worldwide health problem of epidemic proportions. Bariatric surgery remains the most effective treatment for patients with severe obesity, resulting in improved obesity-related co-morbidities and increased overall life expectancy. However, weight recidivism has been observed in a subset of patients post-bariatric surgery. Weight recidivism has significant medical, societal and economic ramifications. Unfortunately, there is a very limited understanding of how to predict which bariatric surgical patients are more likely to regain weight following surgery and how to appropriately treat patients who have regained weight. The objective of this paper is to systematically review the existing literature to assess the incidence and causative factors associated with weight regain following bariatric surgery. An electronic literature search was performed of the Medline, Embase and Cochrane library databases along with the PubMed US national library from January 1950 to December 2012 to identify relevant articles. Following an initial screen of 2,204 titles, 1,437 abstracts were reviewed and 1,421 met exclusion criteria. Sixteen studies were included in this analysis: seven case series, five surveys and four non-randomized controlled trials, with a total of 4,864 patients for analysis. Weight regain in these patients appeared to be multi-factorial and overlapping. Aetiologies were categorized as patient specific (psychiatric, physical inactivity, endocrinopathies/metabolic and dietary non-compliance) and operation specific. Weight regain following bariatric surgery varies according to duration of follow-up and the bariatric surgical procedure performed. The underlying causes leading to weight regain are multi-factorial and related to patient- and procedure-specific factors. Addressing post-surgical weight regain requires a systematic approach to patient assessment focusing on contributory dietary, psychologic, medical and surgical factors.", "This prospective, non-randomized, open-label, cohort study addresses the safety and efficacy of exosomes (ExoFlo\u2122) derived from allogeneic bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells as treatment for severe COVID-19. During April 2020, ExoFlo was provided to 24 SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive patients at a single hospital center, all of whom met criteria for severe COVID-19 as well as moderate to severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Patients received a single 15 mL intravenous dose of ExoFlo and were evaluated for both safety and efficacy day 1-14 post-treatment. All safety endpoints were met with no adverse events observed within 72 hours of ExoFlo administration. A survival rate of 83% was observed. 17/24 (71%) of the patients recovered; 3/24 (13%) remained critically ill though stable; 4/24 (16%) expired for reasons unrelated to the treatment. Overall, after one treatment, patients' clinical status and oxygenation improved with an average PaO2/FiO2 ratio increase of 192% (p < 0.001). Laboratory values revealed significant improvements in absolute neutrophil count [mean reduction 32% [(p-value < 0.001)] and lymphopenia with average CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocyte counts increasing by 46% (p < 0.05), 45% (p < 0.05), and 46% (p < 0.001), respectively. Likewise, acute phase reactants declined, with mean C-reactive protein (CRP), Ferritin, and D-dimer reduction of 77% (p < .001), 43% (p < .001), 42% (p <0.05), respectively. In conclusion, due to its safety profile, capacity to restore oxygenation, downregulate cytokine storm, and reconstitute immunity, ExoFlo is a promising therapeutic candidate for severe COVID-19. Future RCTs are needed to determine ExoFlo therapeutic potential.", "Gastric cancer with metastases outside of the regional lymph nodes is deemed oncologically unresectable. Nevertheless, some metastatic lesions are technically resectable by applying established surgical techniques such as para-aortic lymphadenectomy and hepatectomy. At the time of compilation of the Japanese gastric cancer treatment guidelines version 4, systematic reviews were conducted to see whether it is feasible to make any recommendation to dissect both the primary and metastatic lesions with intent to cure, possibly as part of multimodality treatment. Long-term survivors were found among carefully selected groups of patients both in prospective and retrospective studies. In addition, there is a growing list of publications reporting encouraging outcomes of gastrectomy conducted after exceptionally good response to chemotherapy, usually among patients who underwent R0 resection. This type of surgery is often referred to as conversion surgery. It is sometimes difficult to define a clear borderline between curative surgery scheduled after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and the conversion surgery. This review summarizes what we knew after the literature reviews conducted at the time of compiling the Japanese guidelines and in addition reflects some new findings obtained thereafter through clinical trials and retrospective studies. Metastases were divided into three categories based on the major metastatic pathways: lymphatic, hematogenous, and peritoneal. In each of these categories, there were findings that could provide hope for patients with metastatic disease. These findings implied that the surgical technique that we already use could become more useful upon further developments in antineoplastic agents and drug delivery.", "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is known to take an endosomal pathway for cell entry; however, it is thought to enter directly from the cell surface when a receptor-bound virion spike (S) protein is affected by trypsin, which induces cleavage of the S protein and activates its fusion potential. This suggests that SARS-CoV bearing a cleaved form of the S protein can enter cells directly from the cell surface without trypsin treatment. To explore this possibility, we introduced a furin-like cleavage sequence in the S protein at amino acids 798 to 801 and found that the mutated S protein was cleaved and induced cell fusion without trypsin treatment when expressed on the cell surface. Furthermore, a pseudotype virus bearing a cleaved S protein was revealed to infect cells in the presence of a lysosomotropic agent as well as a protease inhibitor, both of which are known to block SARS-CoV infection via an endosome, whereas the infection of pseudotypes with an uncleaved, wild-type S protein was blocked by these agents. A heptad repeat peptide, derived from a SARS-CoV S protein that is known to efficiently block infections from the cell surface, blocked the infection by a pseudotype with a cleaved S protein but not that with an uncleaved S protein. Those results indicate that SARS-CoV with a cleaved S protein is able to enter cells directly from the cell surface and agree with the previous observation of the protease-mediated cell surface entry of SARS-CoV.", " Recurrent prolapse after stapled haemorrhoidopexy is a late complication of the procedure which can present with accompanying symptoms and may require surgery. We describe a technique for treating symptomatic patients, aimed at obtaining remission of symptoms and avoiding recurrences. METHODS After excisional haemorrhoidectomy, a transverse incision is performed on the proximal part of the mucocutaneous bridge, above the plane of the internal sphincter. A flap of anal mucosa is gently raised. Haemorrhoidal tissue is not removed. LigaSure\u2122 may be useful in focussing coagulation and reducing heat diffusion. Denudation of the internal sphincter allows the removal of potential retained staples. Then, stitches are placed between the proximal part of the flap and the proximal divided edge of the rectal mucosa. Excessive devascularisation of the flap must be avoided. RESULTS From January 2007 to January 2011, we treated 11 patients. The procedures lasted a mean of 38.2 \u00b1 11.1 min. One patient (9 %) suffered from bleeding during the night before being discharged, but this did not require surgery, and another (9 %) had urinary retention. No other perioperative complications were observed. The mean visual analogue scale score 1 day and 1 week after surgery was 4.7 \u00b1 1.3 and 2.3 \u00b1 0.5, respectively. At mean follow-up of 4 \u00b1 1.8 years, neither symptomatic nor asymptomatic recurrences have been observed. Two out of three patients presenting with urgency reported regression of symptoms (66.7 %). In all patients suffering from pain after stapled haemorrhoidopexy, the procedure achieved pain relief (2/2, 100 %). No stenoses occurred. CONCLUSIONS This technique is a promising alternative after failed stapled haemorrhoidopexy. Morbidity is low. The procedure may effectively treat associated symptoms.", "Venous thrombosis is a major public health problem associated with significant morbidity and mortality and has a substantial impact on the quality of life. Over the years, it has become more apparent that anticoagulation alone in the treatment of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is insufficient in the prevention of postthrombotic syndrome, which adversely impacts the quality of life of the patient, and it is insufficient in preventing recurrence of DVT. With the advent of innovative catheter designs to deliver thrombolytic therapies in the treatment of DVT, there have been significant advances in the management of DVT. We review the management of DVT with emphasis on catheter-directed interventions.", " The Emergency Department in Trondheim has prepared for a large influx of patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We conducted a study comparing patients in the Emergency Department in the first weeks of the pandemic in Norway (weeks 11 and 12) with the average number of patient visits. MATERIAL AND METHOD Data from patients at the Emergency Department of St Olav's Hospital in the period 6 January 2020-22 March 2020 were retrieved from the Emergency Department's database. Logistical patient data concerning patient numbers, chief complaints, length of stay in the Emergency Department, acuity level, isolation status, and treatment level were analysed. RESULTS In week 12, 331 patients were referred to the Emergency Department, a reduction of 39 % compared with the average of 541 patients in weeks 2-10. There was a general reduction in all patient groups, but particularly those discharged from the Emergency Department. In week 12 there were 56 more patients isolated with suspected/potentially infectious disease (187 %) compared with the average for weeks 2-10, and these patients spent almost two hours longer in the Emergency Department than other patients. INTERPRETATION There was a reduction in patient visits to the Emergency Department in the first weeks of the pandemic. The percentage of patients isolated for infection control increased, and the time spent in the Emergency Department for these patients was greater than for other patients. The reduction in the inflow of patients is expected to be temporary, and the Emergency Department at St Olav's Hospital expects a large influx of patients with suspected COVID-19 disease.", "After many years of clinical research, endovascular thrombectomy has been conclusively proven to be an effective treatment in acute ischemic stroke. The evidence is compelling; however, it is generated in high volume stroke centers with stroke expertise. Challenges remain ahead on translating and implementing this evidence in routine clinical care across the world. The current evidence has opened up avenues for further research and innovation in this field. In this review, we will discuss the evolution of evidence on endovascular thrombectomy followed by a discussion of challenges and future prospects in this exciting field of stroke care.", "Evidence has lately emerged regarding an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 with worse prognosis in patients with obesity, especially among the young. Weight excess is a well-established respiratory disease risk factor, and the newly reported correlation is therefore unsurprising. The underlying pathophysiology is likely multi-stranded, ranging from complement system hyperactivation, increased Interleukin-6 secretion, chronic inflammation, presence of comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension, and a possible local, detrimental effect within the lung. Further understanding the link between obesity and SARS-CoV-2 is crucial, as this could aid proper tailoring of immunomodulatory treatments, together with improving stratification among those possibly requiring critical care.

Recently, a number of studies have indicated that S-1 treatment is effective against thymic carcinoma. S-1 plus cisplatin with concurrent radiotherapy is a commonly used treatment for other malignancies, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In addition, its safety has been confirmed, and it has been reported to have a marked effect against thymic carcinoma. Therefore, we conducted a phase II study of S-1 plus cisplatin with concurrent thoracic radiotherapy for locally advanced thymic carcinoma, in which the overall response rate was employed as the primary endpoint. The secondary endpoints were overall survival, progression-free survival, and safety.", " Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies enable the investigation of neural correlates underlying behavioral performance. We investigate the effect of active and sham Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) treatment on working memory function of patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) considering Task Positive and Default Mode networks (TPN and DMN). METHODS An experiment with 4 levels of visuospatial n-back task was used to investigate the pattern of cortical activation in 17 men with moderate or severe OSAS before and after 2 months of therapeutic (active) or sub-therapeutic (sham) CPAP treatment. RESULTS Patients with untreated OSAS had significantly less deactivation in the temporal regions of the DMN as compared to healthy controls, but activation within TPN regions was comparatively relatively preserved. After 2 months of treatment, active and sham CPAP groups exhibited opposite trends of cerebral activation and deactivation. After treatment, the active CPAP group demonstrated an increase of cerebral activation in the TPN at all task levels and of task-related cerebral deactivation in the anterior midline and medial temporal regions of the DMN at the 3-back level, associated with a significant improvement of behavioral performance, whereas the sham CPAP group exhibited less deactivation in the temporal regions of Default Mode Network and less Task Positive Network activation associated to longer response times at the 3-back. CONCLUSION OSAS has a significant negative impact primarily on task-related DMN deactivation, particularly in the medial temporal regions, possibly due to nocturnal hypoxemia, as well as TPN activation, particularly in the right ventral fronto-parietal network. After 2 months of active nasal CPAP treatment a positive response was noted in both TPN and DMN but without compete recovery of existing behavioral and neuronal deficits. Initiation of CPAP treatment early in the course of the disease may prevent or slow down the occurrence of irreversible impairment.", "Limited data are available regarding the pathophysiology of venous thromboembolism in plastic surgery patients. In an effort to identify patients at greater risk, some investigators promote individual risk assessment using Caprini scores. However, these scores do not correlate with relative risk values. Affected patients cannot be reliably predicted (97% false positive rate). Caprini scores make many body contouring patients candidates for chemoprophylaxis, an intervention that introduces risks related to anticoagulation. Caprini has financial conflicts with several companies that manufacture products such as enoxaparin, commonly used for chemoprophylaxis. Rivaroxaban, taken orally, has been used by some plastic surgeons as an alternative to enoxaparin injections. However, this medication is not United States Food and Drug Administration approved for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in plastic surgery patients, and a reversal agent is unavailable. This article challenges the prevailing wisdom regarding individual risk stratification and chemoprophylaxis. Alternative methods to reduce risk for all patients include safer anesthesia methods and Doppler ultrasound surveillance. Clinical findings alone are unreliable in diagnosing deep venous thromboses. Only by using a reliable diagnostic tool such as Doppler ultrasound are we able to learn more about the natural history of this problem in our patients. Such knowledge is likely to better inform our treatment recommendations.", "Comment on Endovascular treatment of intracranial stenosis.", " AND AIMS Ciclosporin A [CsA] and infliximab [IFX] are similarly effective in preventing short-term colectomy in ulcerative colitis [UC] patients, but long-term data are scarce. We aimed to compare short- and long-term efficacy of CsA and IFX by analysing colectomy rates and failure of remission-induction treatment as outcome parameters for treatment success. METHODS We retrospectively studied hospitalised UC patients who received CsA or IFX for moderate-to-severe UC, between January 2000 and April 2014. The primary endpoint was time to colectomy, and treatment failure [defined as colectomy or another remission-induction treatment with corticosteroids, CsA, or IFX] was used as secondary endpoint. Variables possibly affecting colectomy outcomes were analysed. RESULTS A total of 55 patients were studied for colectomy outcome and 58 patients for treatment failure. A significantly longer follow-up duration was available for CsA-treated patients [p < 0.001, both subcohorts]. Patients showed comparable patient- and disease-specific characteristics. Colectomy rates did not differ significantly at 3, 12, and 36 months: 36% versus 29%, 58% versus 48%, and 64% versus 67% for CsA- and IFX-treated patients, respectively. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed the lowest hazard ratio [HR] for colectomy in patients concomitantly using thiopurines: HR 0.28 (confidence interval [CI] 0.13-0.64), p = 0.002. Treatment failure rates were not significantly different at 3, 12 and 36 months: 35% versus 48%, 51% versus 68%, and 62% versus 83% for CsA- and IFX-treated patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Treatment with CsA and IFX is similarly effective in preventing short- and long-term colectomy in hospitalised UC patients. Furthermore, failure rates of these remission-induction treatments were comparable.", "Arteriovenous malformations of the head and neck are difficult to treat and require a multidisciplinary approach. Interventional radiology can now be used to downgrade previously inoperable lesions to enable ablation, and the use of Onyx\u00ae (Covidien, Irvine, CA, USA), which has revolutionised their management by allowing precise obliteration of the nidus, has enabled the aggressive management of lesions in compromised anatomical areas. We report a series of 31 patients with lesions on the head and neck. They all presented with serious symptoms (Schobinger grade 2-3) and had embolisation with Onyx\u00ae. Some had additional operations. We describe the outcome including complications, and offer some lessons learned from our experience.", " An online survey was conducted to characterize current infection management practices in Italian intensive care units (ICUs), including the antibacterial and antifungal drug regimens prescribed for various types of infections. METHODS During February and March 2011, all 450 ICUs in public hospitals in Italy were invited to take part in an online survey. The questionnaire focused on ICU characteristics, methods used to prevent, diagnose, and treat infections, and antimicrobials prescribing policies. The frequency of each reported practice was calculated as a percentage of the total number of units answering the question. The overall response rate to the questionnaire was 38.8% (175 of the 450 ICUs contacted) with homogeneous distribution across the country and in terms of unit type. RESULTS Eighty-eight percent of the responding facilities performed periodical surveillance cultures on all patients. In 71% of patients, cultures were also collected on admission. Endotracheal/bronchial aspirates were the most frequently cultured specimens at both time points. Two-thirds of the responding units had never performed screening cultures for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Around 67% of the ICUs reported the use of antimicrobial de-escalation strategies during the treatment phase. In general, the use of empirical antimicrobial drug regimens was appropriate. Although the rationale for the choice was not always clearly documented, the use of a combination therapy was preferred over antibiotic monotherapy. The preferred first-line agents for invasive candidiasis were fluconazole and an echinocandin (64% and 25%, respectively). Two-thirds of the ICUs monitored vancomycin serum levels and administered it by continuous infusion in 86% of cases. For certain antibiotics, reported doses were too low to ensure effective treatment of severe infections in critically ill patients; conversely, inappropriately high doses were administered for certain antifungal drugs. CONCLUSIONS Although infection control policies and management practices are generally appropriate in Italian ICUs, certain aspects, such as the extensive use of multidrug empirical regimens and the inappropriate antimicrobial dosing, deserve careful management and closer investigation.", " The optimal approach to stroke prevention in geriatric patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) has not been adequately clarified. Despite their high risk of stroke and clear indication for anticoagulation according to established risk scores, in practice geriatric AF patients often are withheld treatment because of comorbidities and comedications, concerns about low treatment adherence or fear of bleeding events, in particular due to falls. METHOD The present position paper summarises the outcomes of an expert panel discussion held by hospital-based and office-based physicians with ample experience in the treatment of geriatric patients. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS The panel agreed that geriatric patients should receive oral anticoagulation as a rule, unless a comprehensive neurological and geriatric assessment (including clinical examination, gait tests and validated instruments such as Modified Rankin Scale, Mini-mental state examination or Timed Test of Money Counting) provides sound reasons for refraining from treatment AII patients with a history of falls should be thoroughly evaluated for further evaluation of the causes. Patients with CHADS2 score \u2265 2 should receive anticoagulation even if at high risk for falls. The novel oral anticoagulants (NOAC) facilitate management in the geriatric population with AF (no INR monitoring needed, easier bridging during interventions) and have an improved benefit-risk ratio compared to vitamin K antagonists. Drugs with predominantly non-renal elimination are safer in geriatric", "A large number of adrenal tumors are now identified either incidentally or associated with a metastatic workup for cancer. While the vast majority of these lesions are benign, those that prove to be primary or secondary cancers are traditionally treated with surgical resection. A wide variety of alternative, less invasive therapies exist. One of these, thermal ablation, is examined herein.", "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has recently become a worldwide outbreak with several millions of people infected and more than 160.000 deaths. A fast and accurate diagnosis in this outbreak is critical to isolate and treat patients. Radiology plays an important role in the diagnosis and management of the patients. Among various imaging modalities, chest CT has received attention with its higher sensitivity and specificity rates. Shortcomings of the real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction test, including inappropriate sample collection and analysis methods, initial false negative results, and limited availability has led to widespread use of chest CT in the diagnostic algorithm. This review summarizes the role of radiology in COVID-19 pneumonia, diagnostic accuracy of imaging, and chest CT findings of the disease.", "A lack of surveillance and diagnostics for zoonotic diseases in rural human clinics limits clinical awareness of these diseases. We assessed the prevalence of nine zoonotic pathogens in a pastoral, low-income, HIV-endemic community bordering wildlife reserves in South Africa. Two groups of participants were included: malaria-negative acute febrile illness (AFI) patients, called febrilers, at three clinics (n = 74) and second, farmers, herders, and veterinary staff found at five government cattle dip-tanks, called dip-tanksters (n = 64). Blood samples were tested using one PCR (Bartonella spp.) and eight antibody-ELISAs, and questionnaires were conducted to assess risk factors. Seventy-seven percent of febrilers and 98% of dip-tanksters had at least one positive test. Bartonella spp. (PCR 9.5%), spotted fever group (SFG) Rickettsia spp. (IgM 24.1%), Coxiella burnetii. (IgM 2.3%), and Leptospira spp. (IgM 6.8%) were present in febrilers and could have been the cause of their fever. Dip-tanksters and febrilers had evidence of past infection to Rickettsia spp. (IgG 92.2% and 63.4%, respectively) and C. burnetii (IgG 60.9% and 37.8%, respectively). No Brucella infection or current Bartonella infection was found in the dip-tanksters, although they had higher levels of recent exposure to Leptospira spp. (IgM 21.9%) compared to the febrilers. Low levels of West Nile and Sindbis, and no Rift Valley fever virus exposure were found in either groups. The only risk factor found to be significant was attending dip-tanks in febrilers for Q fever (p = 0.007). Amoxicillin is the local standard treatment for AFI, but would not be effective for Bartonella spp. infections, SFG rickettsiosis, Q fever infections, or the viral infections. There is a need to revise AFI treatment algorithms, educate medical and veterinary staff about these pathogens, especially SFG rickettsiosis and Q fever, support disease surveillance systems, and inform the population about reducing tick and surface water contact.", " Parastomal hernia is a common complication of a colostomy. Ultimately, one-third of patients with a parastomal hernia will need surgical correction due to frequent leakage or life-threatening bowel obstruction or strangulation. However, treatment remains a challenge resulting in high recurrence rates. Two single center trials demonstrated that the frequency of parastomal hernias decreases by prophylactic placement of a mesh around the stoma at the time of formation. Unfortunately, both studies were small-sized, single-center studies and with these small numbers less common complications could be missed which were the reasons to initiate a prospective randomized multicenter trial to determine if a retromuscular, preperitoneal mesh at the stoma site prevents parastomal hernia and does not cause unacceptable complications. METHODS One hundred and fifty patients undergoing open procedure, elective formation of a permanent end-colostomy will be randomized into two groups. In the intervention group an end-colostomy is created with placement of a preperitioneal, retromuscular lightweight monofilament polypropylene mesh, and compared to a group with a traditional stoma without mesh. Patients will be recruited from 14 teaching hospitals in the Netherlands during a 2-year period. Primary endpoint is the incidence of parastomal hernia. Secondary endpoints are stoma complications, cost-effectiveness, and quality of life. Follow-up will be performed at 3 weeks, 3 months and at 1, 2, and 5 years. To find a difference of 20% with a power of 90%, a total number of 134 patients must be included. All results will be reported according to the CONSORT 2010 statement. DISCUSSION The PREVENT-trial is a multicenter randomized controlled trial powered to determine whether prophylactic placement of a polypropylene mesh decreases the incidence of a parastomal hernia versus the traditional stoma formation without a mesh. TRIAL REGISTRATION The PREVENT-trial is registered at: https://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/admin/rctview.asp?TC=2018.", "Like other positive-strand RNA viruses, alphaviruses replicate their genomes in association with modified intracellular membranes. Alphavirus replication sites consist of numerous bulb-shaped membrane invaginations (spherules), which contain the double-stranded replication intermediates. Time course studies with Semliki Forest virus (SFV)-infected cells were combined with live-cell imaging and electron microscopy to reveal that the replication complex spherules of SFV undergo an unprecedented large-scale movement between cellular compartments. The spherules first accumulated at the plasma membrane and were then internalized using an endocytic process that required a functional actin-myosin network, as shown by blebbistatin treatment. Wortmannin and other inhibitors indicated that the internalization of spherules also required the activity of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The spherules therefore represent an unusual type of endocytic cargo. After endocytosis, spherule-containing vesicles were highly dynamic and had a neutral pH. These primary carriers fused with acidic endosomes and moved long distances on microtubules, in a manner prevented by nocodazole. The result of the large-scale migration was the formation of a very stable compartment, where the spherules were accumulated on the outer surfaces of unusually large and static acidic vacuoles localized in the pericentriolar region. Our work highlights both fundamental similarities and important differences in the processes that lead to the modified membrane compartments in cells infected by distinct groups of positive-sense RNA viruses.", "A patient with an umbilical hernia presenting with collateral veins in the abdominal wall and umbilicus is a case that every hernia surgeon has to deal with occasionally. Several underlying diseases have been described to provoke collateral veins in the abdominal wall. However, the treatment strategy should be uniform. We herein report a case of a successful laparoscopic umbilical hernia repair in a patient with collateral veins in the abdominal wall and umbilicus. A 63-year-old man was referred to the surgical outpatient clinic with a large symptomatic umbilical hernia and collateral veins in the abdominal wall, secondary to an occlusion of both common iliac veins. Because of collateral veins in the umbilicus and the size of the hernial defect, he was offered laparoscopic hernia repair without compromising these veins. Because of the extensive abdominal wall collaterals, duplex sonography vein mapping was performed preoperatively to mark a safe collateral-free area for trocar introduction. The defect was repaired by mesh prosthesis.", " Level II-III inferior vena cava (IVC) tumor thrombectomy for renal cell carcinoma is among the most challenging urologic oncologic surgeries. In 2015, we reported the initial series of robot-assisted level III caval thrombectomy. OBJECTIVE To describe our University of Southern California technique in a step-by-step fashion for robot-assisted IVC level II-III tumor thrombectomy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Twenty-five selected patients with renal neoplasm and level II-III IVC tumor thrombus underwent robot-assisted surgery with a minimum 1-yr follow-up (July 2011 to March 2015). SURGICAL PROCEDURE Our standardized anatomic-based \"IVC-first, kidney-last\" technique for robot-assisted IVC thrombectomy focuses on minimizing the chances of an intraoperative tumor thromboembolism and major hemorrhage. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Baseline demographics, pathology data, 90-d and 1-yr complications, and oncologic outcomes at last follow-up were assessed. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS Robot-assisted IVC thrombectomy was successful in 24 patients (96%) (level III: n=11; level II: n=13); one patient was electively converted to open surgery for failure to progress. Median data included operative time of 4.5h, estimated blood loss was 240ml, hospital stay 4 d; five patients (21%) received intraoperative blood transfusion. All surgical margins were negative. Complications occurred in four patients (17%): two were Clavien 2, one was Clavien 3a, and one was Clavien 3b. All patients were alive at a 16-mo median follow-up (range: 12-39 mo). CONCLUSIONS Robotic IVC tumor thrombectomy is feasible for level II-III thrombi. To maximize intraoperative safety and chances of success, a thorough understanding of applied anatomy and altered vascular collateral flow channels, careful patient selection, meticulous cross-sectional imaging, and a highly experienced robotic team are essential. PATIENT SUMMARY We present the detailed operative steps of a new minimally invasive robot-assisted surgical approach to treat patients with advanced kidney cancer. This type of surgery can be performed safely with low blood loss and excellent outcomes. Even patients with advanced kidney cancer could now benefit from robotic surgery with a quicker recovery.", "PURPOSE A single surgeon skilled in conventional laparoscopic surgery used laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) to treat benign urological diseases. This study reports our surgical results and introduces a simple technique with tips based on our experience. MATERIALS AND METHODS LESS surgery was performed on 116 patients by use of a homemade single-port device composed of an Alexis wound retractor and a powder-free surgical glove. Cases were 44 varicocelectomies (including 8 bilateral cases), 38 renal cyst marsupializations (including 3 bilateral cases), 26 ureterolithotomies (with 1 concomitant ureterolithotomy and contralateral renal cyst marsupialization), 4 prostatic enucleations, and 4 bladder rupture repairs. The mean patient age was 44.43\u00b116.46 years (range, 11 to 76 years), and the male-to-female ratio was 87:29. RESULTS In one ureterolithotomy case, LESS was converted to conventional laparoscopic surgery. The mean operative time was 87.03\u00b145.03 minutes, the estimated blood loss was 61.90 ml (range, 0 to 2,000 ml), and the mean hospital stay was 3.03\u00b12.12 days. Two patients underwent single-port transvesical enucleation of the prostate (STEP) requiring patient-controlled anesthesia. No patients developed major complications, and all patients were satisfied, with 75.86% expressing a high degree of satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS We report successful treatment outcomes for LESS in 116 cases of benign urological disease. Our findings suggest that LESS can replace conventional laparoscopy.", ": Lungs from patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have shown typical signs of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), formation of hyaline membrane mainly composed of fibrin, and 'ground-glass' opacity. Previously, we showed plasminogen itself is a key regulator in fibrin degradation, wound healing and infection. AIM: We aimed to investigate whether plasminogen can improve lung lesions and hypoxemia of COVID-19. DESIGN: Thirteen clinically moderate, severe or critical COVID-19 patients were treated with atomization inhalation of freeze-dried plasminogen. METHODS: Levels of their lung lesions, oxygen saturation and heart rates were compared before and after treatment by CT scanning images and patient monitor. RESULTS: After plasminogen inhalation, conditions of lung lesions in 5 clinically moderate patients have quickly improved, shown as the decreased range and density of 'ground glass' opacity. Improvements of oxygen saturation were observed in 6 clinically severe patients. In the 2 patients with critical conditions, the oxygen levels have significantly increased from 79-82% to 91% just about 1 hour after the first inhalation. In 8 of 13 patients the heart rates had slowed down. For the 5 clinically moderate patients, the difference is even statistically significant. Furthermore, a general relief of chest tightness was observed. CONCLUSION: Whereas it is reported that plasminogen is dramatically increased in adults with ARDS, this study suggests that additional plasminogen may be effective and efficient in treating lung lesions and hypoxemia during COVID-19 infections. Although further studies are needed, this study highlights a possible hope of efficiently combating this rapid epidemic emergency.", "PURPOSE: The COVID-19 infection is an aggressive viral illness with high risk of transmission during otolaryngology examination and surgery. Cholesteatoma is known for its potential to cause complications and scheduling of surgery during the pandemic must be done carefully. The majority of otological surgeries may be classified as elective and postponed at this time (e.g., stapedotomy, tympanoplasty); whereas, others are emergencies (e.g., complicated acute otitis media, complicated cholesteatoma with cerebral or Bezold\u2019s abscess, meningitis, sinus thrombosis) and require immediate intervention. What is the ideal time for the surgical management of Cholesteatoma during the COVID-19 pandemic? METHODS: Senior otologic surgeons from six teaching hospitals from various countries affected by the COVID-19 from around the world met remotely to make recommendations on reorganizing schedules for the treatment of cholesteatoma which has a risk of severe morbidity and mortality. The recommendations are based on their experiences and on available literature. RESULTS: Due to the high risk of infecting the surgical staff it is prudent to stop all elective ear surgeries and plan cholesteatoma surgery after careful selection of patients, based on the extent of the disease and available resources. Specific precautions including use of appropriate personal protection equipment should be followed when operating on all patients during the pandemic. To facilitate the decision-making in the management of cholesteatoma, timing for surgery can be divided into two categories with 3 and 2 sub-groups based on disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence on the timing of surgery of patients with cholesteatoma during the COVID-19 pandemic is lacking. This manuscript contains practical tips on how cholesteatoma surgery can be reorganized during this pandemic.", "Annular pancreas is a rare anomaly in which a ring of pancreatic tissue encircles the second portion of the duodenum. We herein report a case involving a 79-year-old Japanese man with an intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) of the pancreas. Imaging studies showed that the pancreatic tissue encircled the descending part of the duodenum and that a 30-mm-diameter cystic tumor was present in the annular segment, leading to the diagnosis of pancreatic IPMN. Limited pancreatic resection was successfully performed by careful division of the annular segment from the second portion of the duodenum. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient's pancreatic function was retained without the need for supplementation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of IPMN occurring in the annular segment of the pancreas. Limited resection of the pancreatic annular segment is a feasible surgical treatment for noninvasive IPMN of the annular pancreas.", " Adult diaphragmatic hernia is a rare case and usually present with various clinical manifestations. Surgery can be done by thoracic and abdominal approaches. In emergency cases, mostly performed by abdominal approach. The use of mesh to close the defect is currently emerging as a viable option. PRESENTATION OF CASE We report a case of 70-year-old woman with complaints of shortness of breath and abdominal pain. The patient had a history of laparoscopic surgery with the installation of an anti-adhesive mesh for diaphragmatic hernia seven months before admission. Chest X-ray and Computed Tomography (CT) scan found recurrence of diaphragmatic hernia. The patient then received laparotomy showing diaphragmatic hernia with contents in the form of transverse colon, ileum, gastric and omentum. The self-attached mesh was placed on the supra-diaphragm with abdominal approach. The patient was hospitalised four days after surgery. At two weeks and six months follow-up, no complaints were found. CT scan and chest X-ray were within normal limits. DISCUSSION We did a modified technique in managing the recurrence and adhesion of the diaphragmatic hernia using the hernia mesh attached onto the superior side of the diaphragm to minimise the complications and recurrences. CONCLUSIONS Transabdominal supradiaphragmatic self-attached mesh for recurrent diaphragmatic hernia can be considered to be an alternative treatment for recurrent diaphragmatic hernia in an emergency setting because this procedure is relatively easier, safer, causes fewer postoperative complications, and can prevent recurrence.", " Laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy (LSC) has established itself as a safe method for the management of pelvic organ prolapse (POP). Laparoscopic suturing is a time-consuming intraoperative task during LSC. Self-retaining barbed sutures (SBSs) are known to reduce the operative time in laparoscopic cases. The current study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SBS during the performance of LSC. MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty female patients with symptomatic POP were treated with LSC by an expert surgeon. The preoperative evaluation included the International Continence Society POP-quantification (POP-Q) and the prolapse-specific quality-of-life questionnaire Mesh fixation was performed with SBS anteriorly on the anterior vaginal wall and posteriorly on the levator ani muscle. A 5-mm titanium tacking device was used for promontofixation. The peritoneum was also closed with an SBS. RESULTS Mean patient's age was 63 years (range: 50-79 years). According to POP-Q, system 3 patients (15%) had Stage I, 12 patients (60%) had Stage II, 3 patients (15%) had Stage III, and 2 patients (10%) had Stage IV prolapse. Concomitant hysterectomy was performed in 14 patients, respectively. Mean operative time was 99.75 (range: 65-140) min, mean blood loss was 57.75 (range: 30-120) ml. One patient had a bladder perforation intraoperatively, and three patients developed transient fever postoperatively. One patient had a recurrent cystocele and three patients recurrent rectocele. CONCLUSIONS The current study renders the use of SBS during LSC to be safe and efficient. Further comparative studies would elucidate the impact of the use of SBS in LSC.", " AND OBJECTIVES Fentanyl sublingual spray may be a viable alternative to intravenous (IV) opioids for the treatment of acute pain. As patients with acute pain may include those who have limited prior exposure to opioids, this phase 1, open-label, randomized, multiple ascending-dose study was conducted to assess the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, and tolerability of multiple doses of fentanyl sublingual spray in opioid-na\u00efve participants. This article primarily reports the pharmacokinetics results. METHODS Study drugs were administered in four dosing cohorts: every 0.5, 1, 2, or 4 h for a maximum of three doses per cohort. Eight fasted individuals per cohort were randomized to either fentanyl sublingual spray (100, 200, or 400 \u00b5g) or fentanyl citrate IV 50 \u00b5g (6:2 ratio). Blood samples were collected pre-dose through 24 h post first dose. RESULTS A total of 98 healthy adults were enrolled and 96 completed the study. Mean plasma fentanyl concentrations increased with increasing doses of fentanyl sublingual spray administered every 0.5-4 h. With multiple doses, systemic exposure increased relative to the first dose; shorter dosing intervals resulted in higher concentrations. Analysis of dose proportionality suggested that systemic exposure increased in a linear but slightly greater than dose-proportional manner. Accumulation between the first and last doses of fentanyl sublingual spray was more pronounced with shorter dosing intervals. CONCLUSION Dose-dependent fentanyl pharmacokinetics following multiple doses of fentanyl sublingual spray were well characterized in an opioid-na\u00efve population. CLINICALTRIALS. GOV IDENTIFIER NCT02641340.", " Laparoscopic appendectomy is now the standard of treatment for acute appendicitis in medical centers where advanced minimally invasive surgery is performed, and it has become the standard of care in our institution. The techniques for laparoscopic appendectomy are widely described in surgical textbooks, but the vascular control of the appendicular artery is diverse. In this article, we compare the benefits and possible complications of different techniques to obtain vascular control. SUBJECTS AND METHODS This is a retrospective study of prospectively collected data including all cases of laparoscopic appendectomy from September 1990 to August 2009. Here we describe the different methods used, and we present a large series of 729 cases of laparoscopic appendectomy. In the majority of the cases the diagnosis was acute appendicitis followed by laparoscopic appendectomy. In only 124 cases was an incidental appendectomy performed associated with another laparoscopic procedure. RESULTS In 350 cases (48%) monopolar cauterization was used to obtain vascular control of the appendicular artery. In the other 379 cases the artery was either clipped or stapled (52%). There were no postoperative complications reported. There was no difference in patient outcome with either approach to obtain adequate vascular control. CONCLUSIONS The vascular control of the appendicular artery obtained with monopolar cautery is a safe, fast, and economic approach easily done during a laparoscopic or needlescopic appendectomy with no increased risks or complications.", " AND AIMS Management of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis has typically relied upon treatment intensification driven by symptoms alone. However, a 'treat-to-target' management approach may help to address underlying inflammation, minimise disease activity at early stages of inflammatory bowel disease, limit progression, and improve long-term outcomes. METHODS A systematic literature review was conducted to identify data relevant to a treat-to-target approach in inflammatory bowel disease, published between January 1, 2007 and May 15, 2017. RESULTS Consistent with recommendations of the Selecting Therapeutic Targets in Inflammatory Bowel Disease [STRIDE] working group, studies have investigated factors influencing the achievement of both endoscopic and histological mucosal healing and patient-level outcomes in inflammatory bowel disease [IBD]. Histological healing and biomarker levels have also been shown to be modifiable outcomes. Although there is a lack of prospectively derived evidence validating mucosal healing as a treatment target, data are emerging to suggest that targeting mucosal healing or inflammation rather than symptoms may be cost-effective in some settings. The review highlighted several strategies that may support the implementation of a treat-to-target approach in IBD. The prospective randomised CALM study demonstrated how tight control [whereby treatment decisions are based on close monitoring of inflammatory biomarkers] leads to improvements in endoscopic and clinical outcomes. The review also considered the influence of coordinated care from a multidisciplinary team and patient engagement with improved adherence, as well as the role of therapeutic drug monitoring in inflammatory bowel disease management. CONCLUSIONS A treat-to-target strategy may impact on disease progression and improve outcomes in inflammatory bowel disease. Prospective studies including long-term data are required to ensure that the most appropriate targets and strategies are identified.", "OBJECTIVE Patients with May-Thurner syndrome presenting with acute deep vein thrombosis benefit from early lysis of clot and endovascular treatment. We evaluated the outcome of patients with May-Thurner syndrome who presented with deep vein thrombosis, managed with pharmacomechanical thrombolysis as the primary mode of intervention, in combination with angioplasty and stent placement. METHODS We reviewed all patients with May-Thurner syndrome managed in our institution between January 2009 to December 2015. Patency rate and postthrombotic syndrome were evaluated as primary end points. RESULTS A total of seven patients (6 females, 1 male) with a mean \u00b1 SD age of 48 \u00b1 17 years and mean \u00b1 SD body mass index of 29.64 \u00b1 7.25 kg/m were identified. Six patients presented with acute deep vein thrombosis and one presented with chronic venous insufficiency. Five patients underwent pharmacomechanical thrombolysis (TRELLIS and altepase) with concomitant stenting of the common iliac vein, one had only angioplasty with stent placement, and one had only pharmacomechanical thrombolysis. Median time from presentation to pharmacomechanical thrombolysis was 4 days (range = 1-9). Patency rate and postthrombotic syndrome at 12 months were 100% and 0%, respectively. No patient experienced major bleeding or pulmonary embolism. The median length of stay was 3 days (range = 0-4). There was no mortality associated with the procedure. The mean \u00b1 SD follow-up was 26 \u00b1 15 months. CONCLUSIONS In patients with May-Thurner syndrome, pharmacomechanical thrombolysis is an effective approach for the management of acute deep vein thrombosis, decreasing thrombus burden, and long-term postthrombotic syndrome when used in conjunction with stenting.", "To evaluate the efficacy of halofuginone lactate (Halocur; Intervet) when used prophylactically against cryptosporidiosis in dairy calves, 513 Holstein heifer calves were randomly distributed between two experimental groups. Those in the treatment group (n=259) received 0.1 mg halofuginone base per kg bodyweight daily in a 10 ml solution, for the first seven days following birth, while those in the control group (n=254) received an equal volume of a placebo solution. Faecal samples were collected weekly from all calves until three weeks of age to test for Cryptosporidium oocysts and to assess the diarrhoeal status. Growth parameters of the calves were also recorded at approximately four months of age. Calves that received halofuginone were significantly less likely to shed Cryptosporidium oocysts during the course of the study than placebo-treated calves (odds ratio 0.6, 95 per cent confidence interval 0.4 to 0.9, P=0.009). Mean growth measurements of calves in the treated group were consistently higher than those of the control calves (hipometer-derived P=0.052, wither height P=0.097) and mortality was lower in the treated group (P=0.07). However, these differences were not statistically significant (P>0.05). No association was found between the prophylactic use of halofuginone and the incidence of calf diarrhoea.", " Interaction of conditions and treatments, complicated care needs and substantial treatment burden make patient-physician encounters involving multimorbid older patients highly complex. To optimally integrate patients' preferences, define and prioritise realistic treatment goals and individualise care, a patient-centred approach is recommended. However, the preferences of older patients, who are especially vulnerable and frequently multimorbid, have not been systematically investigated with regard to their health status. The purpose of this evidence map is to explore current research addressing health-related preferences of older patients with multimorbidity, and to identify the knowledge clusters and research gaps. METHODS AND ANALYSIS To identify relevant research, we will conduct searches in the electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, PSYNDEX, CINAHL, Social Science Citation Index, Social Science Citation Index Expanded and the Cochrane library from their inception. We will check reference lists of relevant articles and carry out cited reference research (forward citation tracking). Two independent reviewers will screen titles and abstracts, check full texts for eligibility and extract the data. Any disagreement will be resolved and consensus reached with the help of a third reviewer. We will include both qualitative and quantitative studies, and address preferences from the patients' perspectives in a multimorbid population of 60 years or older. There will be no restrictions on the publication language. Data extraction tables will present study and patient characteristics, aim of study, methods used to identify preferences and outcomes (ie, type of preferences). We will summarise the data using tables and figures (ie, bubble plot) to present the research landscape and to describe clusters and gaps. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Due to the nature of the proposed evidence map, ethics approval will not be required. Results from our research will be disseminated by means of specifically prepared materials for patients, at relevant (inter)national conferences and via publication in peer-reviewed journals.", "Injection of lysosomal enzyme into cisternal or ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has been carried out in 11 lysosomal storage disorder models, with each study demonstrating reductions in primary substrate and secondary neuropathological changes, and several reports of improved neurological function. Whilst acute studies in mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) type II mice revealed that intrathecally-delivered enzyme (into thoraco-lumbar CSF) accesses the brain, the impact of longer-term treatment of affected subjects via this route is unknown. This approach is presently being utilized to treat children with MPS types I, II and III. Our aim was to determine the efficacy of repeated intrathecal injection of recombinant human sulfamidase (rhSGSH) on pathological changes in the MPS IIIA dog brain. The outcomes were compared with those in dogs treated via intra-cisternal or ventricular routes. Control dogs received buffer or no treatment. Significant reductions in primary/secondary substrate levels in brain were observed in dogs treated via all routes, although the extent of the reduction differed regionally. Treatment via all CSF access points resulted in large reductions in microgliosis in superficial cerebral cortex, but only ventricular injection enabled amelioration in deep cerebral cortex. Formation of glutamic acid decarboxylase-positive axonal spheroids in deep cerebellar nuclei was prevented by treatment delivered via any route. Anti-rhSGSH antibodies in the sera of some dogs did not reduce therapeutic efficacy. Our data indicates the capacity of intra-spinal CSF-injected rhSGSH to circulate within CSF-filled spaces, penetrate into brain and mediate a significant reduction in substrate accumulation and secondary pathology in the MPS IIIA dog brain.", " Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) has increasingly gained worldwide acceptance among bariatric surgeons during the past 10 years. Numerous articles have been written about the different approaches to the management of gastric fistulas, but limited data can be found concerning gastric stenosis after LSG. SETTING Private hospital, France. METHODS A total of 18 patients received endoscopic treatment for stenosis after LSG between May 2007 and June 2015. Stenosis was classified according to the endoscopic findings as functional (the passage of the endoscope was possible, but the sleeve was twisted with various degrees of rotation) or mechanical (the passage of the endoscope was very difficult or impossible). RESULTS This study included 13 women and 5 men, with an average age of 37.2\u00b18.4 years and an average body mass index of 41.6\u00b18.7 kg/m2. The average number of endoscopic procedures was 1.3 (range, 1-4). No patient had stent migration. The successful rate of endoscopic approach for stenosis of LSG was 94.4%, with one patient requiring conversion to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. The mean time from the LSG to the first endoscopic intervention was 28.2 days. All patients presented with midsleeve stricture, located near the incisura angularis, and no patient showed a stenosis in the upper part of the gastric tube. CONCLUSIONS The treatment of stenosis after LSG must be tailored to the clinical status of the patient and endoscopic findings. Both balloon dilation and stent deployment are useful and safe tools and must be used when appropriate.", "Pancreatic cancer is a very aggressive disease and survival remains dismal even with treatment Currently, management of patients with pancreatic cancer has been complicated by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic Medical oncologists face the dilemma of whether to treat or to not treat these patients who are at high-risk of complications and even death from COVID-19 No current guidelines are available and our limited experience at this time makes it more difficult to manage these patients Although we have general strategies available from experience in Italy, we need more treatment specific strategies to help mitigate risks of complications and toxicities from chemotherapy in order to protect our patients from COVID-19 as much as possible", " Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banded plication (LAGBP) is a novel bariatric procedure, and little is known about its potential complications. OBJECTIVES Herein, we report on complications of LAGBP and discuss the clinical features and diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in such situations, with emphasis on gastric fold herniation (GFH). SETTING University Hospital. METHODS Prospectively collected data of 223 patients who underwent LAGBP for morbid obesity between August 2009 and December 2014 were retrospectively analyzed. Follow-up at 1 year was 75%. RESULTS Eight patients (3.5%) required readmission due to major complications, including 1 trocar site hernia, 1 band leak, 1 gastric stenosis, and 5 GFHs. GFHs occurred mostly in the first postoperative month (4/5, 80%) and at the fundus (5/5, 100%); 4 GFHs occurred in the initial 70 patients. Seven laparoscopic reoperations were required for managing GFH. The gastric band was removed in 3 patients (of 5; 60%). Two patients developed residual intra-abdominal abscess and were treated successfully by image-guided drainage. In March 2012, we reversed the order of our surgical techniques for the subsequent 153 patients and performed greater curvature plication first, followed by band placement. Only one GFH occurred after this change in surgical order (1/153 versus 4/70; P< .05). CONCLUSIONS High clinical suspicion assisted by radiological investigations and early surgical intervention is the key for managing GFH after LAGBP. Though GFH complications were rare, we significantly reduced its occurrence by altering the surgical order in LAGBP to plication followed by banding.", "Rationale Optimal secondary prevention of embolic stroke of undetermined source is not established. The current standard in these patients is acetylsalicylic acid, despite high prevalence of yet undetected paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Aim The ATTICUS randomized trial is designed to determine whether the factor Xa inhibitor apixaban administered within 7 days after embolic stroke of undetermined source, is superior to acetylsalicylic acid for prevention of new ischemic lesions documented by brain magnetic resonance imaging within 12 months after index stroke. Design Prospective, randomized, blinded, parallel-group, open-label, German multicenter phase III trial in approximately 500 patients with embolic stroke of undetermined source. A key inclusion criterion is the presence or the planned implantation of an insertable cardiac monitor. Patients are 1:1 randomized to apixaban or acetylsalicylic acid and treated for a 12-month period. It is an event-driven trial aiming for core-lab adjudicated primary outcome events. Study outcomes The primary outcome is the occurrence of at least one new ischemic lesion identified by axial T2-weighted FLAIR magnetic resonance imaging and/or axial DWI magnetic resonance imaging at 12 months when compared with the baseline magnetic resonance imaging. Key secondary outcomes are the combination of recurrent ischemic strokes, hemorrhagic strokes, systemic embolism; combination of MACE including recurrent stroke, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular death and combination of major and clinically relevant non-major bleeding defined according to ISTH, and change of cognitive function and quality of life (EQ-5D, Stroke Impact Scale). Discussion Embolic stroke of undetermined source is caused by embolic disease and associated with a high risk of recurrent ischemic strokes and clinically silent cerebral ischemic lesions. ATTICUS will investigate the impact of atrial fibrillation detected by insertable cardiac monitor and the effects of early anticoagulation with apixaban compared with antiplatelet therapy with acetylsalicylic acid on the incidence of new ischemic lesion after embolic stroke of undetermined source.", " The aim of this study is to analyze the safety and efficacy of stent-graft endovascular treatment for visceral artery aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms. METHODS Multicentric retrospective series of patients with visceral aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms treated by means of stent graft. The following variables were analyzed: Age, sex, type of lesion (aneurysms/pseudoaneurysms), localization, rate of success, intraprocedural and long term complication rate (SIR classification). Follow-up was performed under clinical and radiological assessment. RESULTS Twenty-five patients (16 men), with a mean age of 59 (range 27-79), were treated. The indication was aneurysm in 19 patients and pseudoaneurysms in 6. The localizations were: splenic artery (12), hepatic artery (5), renal artery (4), celiac trunk (3) and gastroduodenal artery (1). Successful treatment rate was 96% (24/25 patients). Intraprocedural complication rate was 12% (4% major; 8% minor). Complete occlusion was demonstrated during follow up (mean 33 months, range 6-72) in the 24 patients with technical success. Two stent migrations (2/24; 8%) and 4stent thrombosis (4/24; 16%) were detected. Mortality rate was 0%. CONCLUSION In our study, stent-graft endovascular treatment of visceral aneurysmns and pseudoaneurysms has demonstrated to be safe and is effective in the long-term in both elective and emergent cases, with a high rate of successful treatment and a low complication rate.", "Diaphragmatic plication has been a well employed method for the treatment of diaphragmatic eventration and/or paralysis. Uniportal thoracoscopic procedures seem to offer substantial benefit in terms of postoperative pain and cosmesis with similar outcomes as other surgical techniques. A 60-year-old female patient was referred to our clinic for the surgical treatment of diaphragmatic eventration of an unknown cause. The patient was referred to our institution from another hospital, where she had undergone a femoro-popliteal and crural bypass which was unsuccessful, requiring amputation of her leg. Following surgery, she was unable to breath spontaneously without any specific reason. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging showed no pathology and the neurologists did not have a diagnosis for her comatose state. There was consensus in both hospitals that surgical plication of her elevated diaphragm might be the only option for respiratory improvement. We performed a double-lined diaphragmatic plication procedure by means of uniportal video-assisted thoracic surgery technique with CO2 insufflation using GelPort. Despite the time-consuming adhesiolysis and the need for lung suturing at the end of the procedure, the operative time was 120 min. Oxygenation remarkably improved after the operation, yet the patient remained in comatose state. She was referred back to the hospital where she had initially begun her therapy for further recovery.", "This paper is a narrative review of extraaxial developmental venous anomalies (eDVAs) of the brain involving dural venous flow or sinuses: persistent embryonic sinuses, sinus pericranii, enlarged emissary veins, and venous varices or aneurysmal malformations. The article highlights the natural history, anatomy, embryology, imaging, clinical implications, and neurosurgical significance of these lesions, which the authors believe represent a continuum, with different entities characterized by distinct embryopathologic features. The indications and surgical management options are discussed for these individual intracranial pathologies with relevant illustrations, and a novel classification is proposed for persistent falcine sinus (PFS). The role of neurointervention and/or microsurgery in specific cases such as sinus pericranii and enlarged emissary veins of the skull is highlighted. A better understanding of the pathophysiology and developmental anatomy of these lesions can reduce treatment morbidity and mortality. Some patients, including those with vein of Galen malformations (VOGMs), can present with the added systemic morbidity of a high-output cardiac failure. Although VOGM is the most studied and classified of the above-mentioned eDVAs, the authors believe that grouping the former with the other venous anomalies/abnormalities listed above would enable the clinician to convey the exact morphophysiological configuration of these lesions, predict their natural history with respect to evolving venous hypertension or stroke, and extrapolate invaluable insights from VOGM treatment to the treatment of other eDVAs. In recent years, many of these symptomatic venous malformations have been treated with endovascular interventions, although these techniques are still being refined. The authors highlight the broad concept of eDVAs and hope that this work will serve as a basis for future studies investigating the role of evolving focal venous hypertension/global intracranial hypertension and possibilities of fetal surgical intervention in these cases.", "Objective We aimed to evaluate the impact of underlying mechanism of basilar artery (BA) occlusion on the outcomes after endovascular therapy (EVT) for reperfusion and the outcome factors associated with each mechanism, and to identify radiologic parameters enabling to distinguish the underlying mechanism. Methods From a registry database, 194 consecutive patients with acute BA occlusion who underwent EVT were analyzed. Stroke mechanism, classified into in situ atherosclerotic thrombosis (ISAT) and embolism, clot sign location profiles in pre-angiography magnetic resonance image (MRI), parameters of angiography and EVT, and reperfusion were assessed. Poor outcome was defined as a modified Rankin-Scale score at 90 days of 3-6. Results The mean age was 68.8\u00b111.8 years (range 21-92 years) and seventy-eight (40.2%) were female patients. 102 (52.6%) patients were classified into an embolism mechanism and 92 (47.4%) into an ISAT mechanism. Overall, ISAT mechanism compared with embolism was significantly associated with poor outcomes (P = 0.002), along with the NIHSS scores, reperfusion status, and collateral status. In the embolism group, reperfusion (P = 0.001), NIHSS scores (P < 0.001), and onset-to-treatment time (P = 0.030) were significant outcome factors. However, in the ISAT group, baseline collateral status (P = 0.001) and NIHSS scores (P < 0.001) were significant outcome factors. A clot sign at the distal BA segment on pre-angiography MRI was strongly associated with embolism mechanism (P < 0.001). Interpretation Stroke mechanism has a major influence on outcomes, and outcome predictors differ according to the underlying mechanism in acute BA occlusion with EVT. Clot sign profile on pre-angiography MRI might be useful to determine the underlying mechanism.", "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) continues to grow in global prevalence and consumes an increasing amount of resources in the United States health care system. Overall rates of intervention for PAD have been rising steadily in recent years. Changing demographics, evolution of technologies, and an expanding database of outcomes studies are primary forces influencing clinical decision making in PAD. The management of PAD is multidisciplinary, involving primary care physicians and vascular specialists with varying expertise in diagnostic and treatment modalities. PAD represents a broad spectrum of disease from asymptomatic through severe limb ischemia. The Society for Vascular Surgery Lower Extremity Practice Guidelines committee reviewed the evidence supporting clinical care in the treatment of asymptomatic PAD and intermittent claudication (IC). The committee made specific practice recommendations using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system. There are limited Level I data available for many of the critical questions in the field, demonstrating the urgent need for comparative effectiveness research in PAD. Emphasis is placed on risk factor modification, medical therapies, and broader use of exercise programs to improve cardiovascular health and functional performance. Screening for PAD appears of unproven benefit at present. Revascularization for IC is an appropriate therapy for selected patients with disabling symptoms, after a careful risk-benefit analysis. Treatment should be individualized based on comorbid conditions, degree of functional impairment, and anatomic factors. Invasive treatments for IC should provide predictable functional improvements with reasonable durability. A minimum threshold of a >50% likelihood of sustained efficacy for at least 2 years is suggested as a benchmark. Anatomic patency (freedom from restenosis) is considered a prerequisite for sustained efficacy of revascularization in IC. Endovascular approaches are favored for most candidates with aortoiliac disease and for selected patients with femoropopliteal disease in whom anatomic durability is expected to meet this minimum threshold. Conversely, caution is warranted in the use of interventions for IC in anatomic settings where durability is limited (extensive calcification, small-caliber arteries, diffuse infrainguinal disease, poor runoff). Surgical bypass may be a preferred strategy in good-risk patients with these disease patterns or in those with prior endovascular failures. Common femoral artery disease should be treated surgically, and saphenous vein is the preferred conduit for infrainguinal bypass grafting. Patients who undergo invasive treatments for IC should be monitored regularly in a surveillance program to record subjective improvements, assess risk factors, optimize compliance with cardioprotective medications, and monitor hemodynamic and patency status.", "PURPOSE Metal-on-metal total disc replacement is a recent alternative treatment for degenerative disc disease. Wear and corrosion of these implants can lead to local and systemic transport of metal debris. This prospective longitudinal study examined the serum chromium and cobalt levels in 24 patients with cobalt-chromium alloy metal-on-metal lumbar disc replacements. METHODS Serum was assayed for chromium (Cr) and cobalt (Co) using high-resolution inductively-coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Detection limits were 0.015 ng/mL for Cr and 0.04 ng/mL for Co. RESULTS Median serum Co levels at pre-op, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36-months post-op were 0.10, 1.03, 0.96, 0.98, 0.67, and 0.52 ng/mL, respectively. Median serum Cr levels were 0.06, 0.49, 0.65, 0.43, 0.52, and 0.50 ng/mL, respectively. CONCLUSION In general, these results indicated that serum Co and Cr levels are elevated at all postoperative time points and are of the same order of magnitude as those observed in well-functioning metal-on-metal surface replacements of the hip and in metal-on-metal total hip replacements at similar postoperative time points.", "OPINION STATEMENT Historically, acute ischemic stroke (AIS) trials defined syndromes according to acute clinical presentation and post-ictus parenchymal imaging. With improvements in real-time arterial imaging, modern AIS treatment demands a structural approach based upon the level of cerebrovascular occlusion. The poor concordance of presenting National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) with vessel occlusion in recent trials bespeaks the need for an anatomic perspective. Specifically, patients with large-vessel occlusion (LVO) represent a distinct entity with a poorer prognosis than general AIS patients. Ongoing clinical trials and therapeutic strategies must recognize the varied natural history of AIS patients. Endovascular therapy offers promise in patients with the most severe strokes.", "Background Radiology is an interdisciplinary field dedicated to the diagnosis and treatment of numerous diseases and is involved in the development of multimodal treatment concepts. Method Interdisciplinary case management, a broad spectrum of diagnostic imaging facilities and dedicated endovascular radiological treatment options are valuable tools that allow radiology to set up an interdisciplinary center for vascular anomalies. Results Image-based diagnosis combined with endovascular treatment options is an essential tool for the treatment of patients with highly complex vascular diseases. These vascular anomalies can affect numerous parts of the body so that a multidisciplinary treatment approach is required for optimal patient care. Conclusion This paper discusses the possibilities and challenges regarding effective and efficient patient management in connection with the formation of an interdisciplinary center for vascular anomalies with strengthening of the clinical role of radiologists. Key points \u00b7 Vascular anomalies, which include vascular tumors and malformations, are complex to diagnose and treat.. \u00b7 There are far more patients with vascular anomalies requiring therapy than interdisciplinary centers for vascular anomalies - there is currently a shortage of dedicated interdisciplinary centers for vascular anomalies in Germany that can provide dedicated care for affected patients.. \u00b7 Radiology includes a broad spectrum of diagnostic and minimally invasive therapeutic tools which allow the formation of an interdisciplinary center for vascular anomalies for effective, efficient and comprehensive patient management..

In the United States more than 35,000 deaths and 200,000 hospitalizations due to influenza occur annually, and the number is increasing. Children aged less than 1 year and adults aged more than 65 years, pregnant woman, and people of any age with comorbid illnesses are at highest risk. Annual vaccination is the cornerstone of prevention, but some older patients may derive less benefit from immunization than otherwise fit individuals. If started promptly, antiviral medications may reduce complications of acute influenza, but increasing resistance to amantadine and perhaps neuraminidase inhibitors underscores the need for novel prevention and treatment strategies. Pulmonary complications of influenza are most common and include primary influenza and secondary bacterial infection. Either may cause pneumonia, and each has a unique clinical presentation and pathologic basis. Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant strains, is an important cause of secondary bacterial pneumonia with high mortality. During influenza season, treatment of pneumonia should include empiric coverage for this pathogen. Neuromuscular and cardiac complications are unusual but may manifest in persons of any age.", "Foreign material emboli following cerebral, cardiac, and peripheral catheterizations have been reported since the mid-1990s. Catheter coatings have been frequently implicated. The most recent surge of interest in this phenomenon within the neurointerventional community is associated with procedures using flow-diversion devices for the treatment of cerebral aneurysms. Following coil-supported Pipeline embolization in 4 cases and stent-supported coiling in 1, 5 patients developed multiple subcentimeter enhancing lesions, usually with surrounding edema and variable magnetic susceptibility in the vascular territories of the treated aneurysms. Conventional angiography findings were unrevealing. Laboratory work-up showed mild CSF protein elevation with no leukocytosis. Brain biopsy in 2 cases revealed granulomatous angiitis encasing foreign material, identical in stain appearance to a polyvinylpyrrolidone catheter coating. Corticosteroid administration typically produced clinical improvement. A heterogeneous radiographic and clinical course was noted, with rise and fall in the number of enhancing lesions in 2 patients and persistence in others. The etiology may be related to widespread adoption of increasingly sophisticated catheterization techniques.", "Interferons (IFNs) are the first line of defense against viral infections. Although type I and II IFNs have proven effective to inhibit foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) replication in swine, a similar approach had only limited efficacy in cattle. Recently, a new family of IFNs, type III IFN or IFN-\u03bb, has been identified in human, mouse, chicken, and swine. We have identified bovine IFN-\u03bb3 (boIFN-\u03bb3), also known as interleukin 28B (IL-28B), and demonstrated that expression of this molecule using a recombinant replication-defective human adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) vector, Ad5-boIFN-\u03bb3, exhibited antiviral activity against FMDV in bovine cell culture. Furthermore, inoculation of cattle with Ad5-boIFN-\u03bb3 induced systemic antiviral activity and upregulation of IFN-stimulated gene expression in the upper respiratory airways and skin. In the present study, we demonstrated that disease could be delayed for at least 6 days when cattle were inoculated with Ad5-boIFN-\u03bb3 and challenged 24 h later by intradermolingual inoculation with FMDV. Furthermore, the delay in the appearance of disease was significantly prolonged when treated cattle were challenged by aerosolization of FMDV, using a method that resembles the natural route of infection. No clinical signs of FMD, viremia, or viral shedding in nasal swabs was found in the Ad5-boIFN-\u03bb3-treated animals for at least 9 days postchallenge. Our results indicate that boIFN-\u03bb3 plays a critical role in the innate immune response of cattle against FMDV. To this end, this work represents the most successful biotherapeutic strategy so far tested to control FMDV in cattle.", " Major pelvic ilio-iliac arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is an exceedingly rare diagnosis with only a few described cases in the literature, most of them related to congenital defects or trauma. In this case report, we aim to present a case of an ilio-iliac AVF with an atypical clinical presentation. METHODS Relevant medical data were collected from hospital database. RESULTS The patient is a 77-year-old woman, with a relevant medical history of a temporally remote hysterectomy. She developed an exuberant unilateral right leg edema and was diagnosed with a femoro-iliac deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and started on anticoagulation and daily use of elastic compression stockings. No improvement in leg edema was evident, and she reported painful complaints refractory to medication. She also progressively developed right foot numbness and foot drop. A computed tomography angiography (CTA) was performed to exclude any compressive or paraneoplastic syndrome, with no remarkable findings other than common iliac vein (CIV) occlusion. As the patient's symptoms continued to worsen, a new CTA was performed 5 months later, which revealed an ilio-iliac AVF that was confirmed by angiography. After 2 ineffective attempts to embolize AVF afferents, we chose to completely embolize the arterial component of the AVF with Helix EV3 coils and Onyx glue (Covidien, Irvine, CA, USA). CIV recanalization and deployment of a Venovo stent (Bard Inc, Tempe, AZ, USA) was also performed. The final angiograms showed exclusion of the AVF and rapid venous flow through the stent. There was progressive improvement of edema and pain but little improvement of foot drop. CONCLUSION AVF etiology and mechanism of neurologic deficits are controversial, with multiple possible explanations. Endovascular treatment modalities are promising a safer and more efficient approach when compared with open surgery. Our experience in this case was encouraging, but long-term results are currently lacking.", ": The envelope (E) of dengue virus (DENV) is the major target of neutralizing antibodies and vaccine development. After biosynthesis E protein forms a heterodimer with precursor membrane (prM) protein. Recent reports of infection enhancement by anti-prM monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) suggest anti-prM responses could be potentially harmful. Previously, we studied a series of C-terminal truncation constructs expressing DENV type 4 prM/E or E proteins and found the ectodomain of E protein alone could be recognized by all 12 mAbs tested, suggesting E protein ectodomain as a potential subunit immunogen without inducing anti-prM response. The characteristics of DENV E protein ectodomain in the absence of prM protein remains largely unknown. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we investigated the expression, membrane association, glycosylation pattern, secretion and particle formation of E protein ectodomain of DENV4 in the presence or absence of prM protein. E protein ectodomain associated with membrane in or beyond trans-Golgi and contained primarily complex glycans, whereas full-length E protein associated with ER membrane and contained high mannose glycans. In the absence of prM protein, E protein ectodomain can secrete as well as form particles of approximately 49 nm in diameter, as revealed by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation with or without detergent and electron microscopy. Mutational analysis revealed that the secretion of E protein ectodomain was affected by N-linked glycosylation and could be restored by treatment with ammonia chloride. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Considering the enhancement of DENV infectivity by anti-prM antibodies, our findings provide new insights into the expression and secretion of E protein ectodomain in the absence of prM protein and contribute to future subunit vaccine design.", " Natural orifice transumbilical endoscopic surgery (NOTES) is a technique still in experimental development that requires clinical trials to assess its safety and efficacy. We present a pilot prospective, randomized, three-arm clinical trial of 1-year duration that was conducted as a noninferiority trial comparing single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) and flexible single-incision surgery (FSIS) with conventional laparoscopy for elective cholecystectomy (NCT01558414). METHODS Sixty patients between aged 18 and 65 years who were eligible for elective cholecystectomy were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio (n = 20 per group): group A (SILS), single-incision endoscopic surgery using a transumbilical SILS\u2122 device; group B (FSIS), single-incision transumbilical surgery using a flexible endoscope; and group C (CL), conventional laparoscopy. The main outcome variable of the study was \"parietal complications\" (wound infection, bleeding, and ventral hernia). The analysis was by intention to treat and attritions were not replaced. RESULTS Cholecystectomy was performed in 100 % of the cases; perioperative complications occurred in only 1.6 % of the cases, and umbilical surgical wound infection in 3.33 %, with no differences between groups. After a minimum follow-up of 1 year, no differences were noted in the frequency of parietal complications and no ventral hernias occurred. Postoperative pain, hospital length of stay, and downtime from work were similar in all three groups. Surgical time was longer in cases in which a single-incision transumbilical approach was used (58.95 min for SILS and 54.15 for FSIS vs. 49.21 for laparoscopy). CONCLUSIONS Single-incision transumbilical approaches are not inferior for safety or effectiveness compared with conventional laparoscopy. The transumbilical approach using a flexible endoscope is just as effective and safe as the other two procedures and is a promising single-incision approach.", ": The potential risk of cytokine storm in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has been described(1); we write to share our experience treating a 17-year-old male with haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) secondary to Covid-19 infection. CASE REPORT: This patient presented with cough, sore throat, anorexia and pyrexia. On examination, he had gross cervical lymphadenopathy and palpable splenomegaly. Nose and throat swab for SARS-CoV-2 was positive and blood tests revealed pancytopaenia with very high ferritin, triglyceride and d-dimer levels. The patient\u2019s HScore(2) was calculated at 220, suggesting probability of HLH of 93-96%. Considering Russell and colleagues\u2019(3) comments about potential harm of corticosteroid use in patients with Covid-19 infection, the patient was commenced on treatment with the selective IL-1 receptor antagonist drug, Anakinra, and a two day course of intravenous immunoglobulin. RESULTS: The patient responded rapidly to treatment, becoming apyrexial after 24 hours. His lymph nodes and spleen began to normalise after the first 48 hours, at which time point the ferritin also started to decrease. He was discharged after 11 days feeling fit and well. CONCLUSION: This case certainly illustrates the importance of hyperinflammation syndromes in Covid-19. It also raises the question \u2013 is the severe pneumonitis seen in patients with Covid-19 an immunological phenomenon? We know that the viral load of patients with Covid-19 seems to peak in the early stages of illness(4, 5), however patients deteriorate later in the disease course, at around days 10-14. This patient, who had risk factors for deterioration (male, pancytopaenic), did not develop an oxygen requirement and clinically and biochemically improved rapidly on Anakinra with no adverse events. We might suggest Anakinra to the scientific community as a treatment option in Covid-19 infection.", "Nephron sparing surgery (NSS) is the gold standard treatment option for patients with a solitary kidney in order to preserve renal function. Open partial nephrectomy (OPN) has been long considered the standard care for NSS. Robotic partial nephrectomy (RPN) is being gradually used more commonly even for solitary kidney and complex tumors. There was no difference between RPN and OPN regarding the rate of intraoperative-postoperative complications and positive surgical margin (PSM) (RPN: 7.5%, OPN: 8%) for patients with solitary kidney who underwent partial nephrectomy for small renal masses. Warm ischemia time (WIT) in all of our studies was within the safe range of <25 minutes which is acceptable ischemia time for robotic approaches. More studies are needed in order to evaluate kidney function. In conclusion with increasing experience, solitary kidney tumors can be managed safely with robotic approach. For patients having complex tumors with a potential of WIT >25 minutes, administration of intracorporeal ice slush during surgery may be considered.", "Dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) is a rare type of acquired intracranial vascular malformation. Recent progress in neuroimaging technology, such as advanced MRI and CT, provides non-invasive methods to accurately diagnose DAVF, including evaluation of the hemodynamics of the drainage veins. The clinical manifestations of DAVFs vary widely and depend on the location and venous drainage pattern of arteriovenous shunting. Patients with high grade DAVFs having cortical venous reflux should receive aggressive treatment to prevent the occurrence of intracranial hemorrhage and other neurological deficits related to venous congestion. Intra-arterial or intravenous endovascular embolization remains the primary therapy for high grade DAVF, while open surgery and stereotactic radiosurgery can serve as alternative treatment options. Early and accurate diagnosis with appropriate treatment is the goal for clinical management of DAVFs to reduce symptoms and prevent the development of venous congestion and stroke.", "Since the late 1990s, the use of transgenic animal platforms has transformed the discovery of fully human therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. The first approved therapy derived from a transgenic platform--the epidermal growth factor receptor antagonist panitumumab to treat advanced colorectal cancer--was developed using XenoMouse(\u00ae) technology. Since its approval in 2006, the science of discovering and developing therapeutic monoclonal antibodies derived from the XenoMouse(\u00ae) platform has advanced considerably. The emerging array of antibody therapeutics developed using transgenic technologies is expected to include antibodies and antibody fragments with novel mechanisms of action and extreme potencies. In addition to these impressive functional properties, these antibodies will be designed to have superior biophysical properties that enable highly efficient large-scale manufacturing methods. Achieving these new heights in antibody drug discovery will ultimately bring better medicines to patients. Here, we review best practices for the discovery and bio-optimization of monoclonal antibodies that fit functional design goals and meet high manufacturing standards.", " Basilar artery occlusion (BAO) is a rare stroke subtype with high mortality rates. Best BAO reperfusion strategy is still controversial. OBJECTIVE We aim to describe outcomes of BAO patients submitted to mechanical thrombectomy (MT) in a comprehensive stroke center in Brazil and analyze which previous published computed tomography angiography (CTA) collateral score better predict functional outcomes. METHODS Retrospective analysis of consecutive BAO patients. CTA was used to evaluate the posterior circulation collateral score (PC-CS), the basilar artery on CTA score, and for the presence of posterior communicating arteries. A favorable outcome was defined as modified Rankin Score \u22643 at 90-days. After univariate analyses, multivariate logistic regression was used to identify if any collateral score independently predicts favorable outcomes. RESULTS Between January 2011 and April 2017, 27 (85% male) BAO patients with median NIHSS 26 (IQR 15-32) were identified. Twenty-five (93%) patients were treated with MT devices, and only 2 (7%) patients were treated with angioplasty and stenting. Successful recanalization rate was 85%, and only 1 (3.7%) patient had symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation. Favorable outcomes were reached in 10 (37%) patients. In univariate analysis, female sex, NIHSS, Glasgow coma scale, mild-to-moderate symptoms on admission, onset-to-groin time, and PC-CS predicted favorable outcomes. In multivariate analysis, PC-CS (OR 1.69; 95% CI 1.10-2.60; p = 0.016) and NIHSS (OR 0.84; 95% CI 0.77-0.93; p = 0.001) remained the only independent predictors of favorable outcomes. The PC-CS AUC was 0.80 (95% CI 0.62-0.98; p = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS MT is a promising strategy for BAO treatment. Among collateral scores, PC-CS was the only independent predictor of favorable outcomes in the present study.", " This study aimed to investigate the short-term surgical outcomes of laparoscopic gastrectomy for gastric cancer in elderly patients in order to determine the safety, feasibility, and risk factors for postoperative complications associated with this procedure. METHODS We retrospectively investigated 208 patients who underwent laparoscopic gastrectomy for gastric cancer between January 2007 and September 2014. After excluding 15 patients with unusual medical histories or surgical treatments, 193 were selected for this cohort study. We divided the patients into two cohorts: elderly patients (\u226575 years old) and non-elderly patients (<74 years old). We compared these cohorts with respect to clinicopathological characteristics and intraoperative and postoperative parameters. RESULTS The overall complication rates were 11.4% (8 of 70 patients) in the elderly cohort and 8.1% (10 of 123 patients) in the non-elderly cohort (P = 0.449). In a univariate analysis, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) of \u22653, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score of 3, operative time of \u2265330 min, and intraoperative blood loss of \u226550 ml were found to correlate significantly with postoperative complications. In a multivariate analysis, CCI of \u22653 (P = 0.034), ASA score of 3 (P = 0.019), and intraoperative blood loss of \u226550 ml (P = 0.016) were found to be independent risk factors of postoperative complications. In contrast, age was not found to significantly affect the risk of postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic gastrectomy for gastric cancer can be successfully performed in elderly patients with an acceptable complication rate. This study suggested that high CCI, ASA score, and intraoperative blood loss volume were identified as independent predictors of postoperative complications after laparoscopic gastrectomy for gastric cancer.", "Highly pathogenic Nipah virus (NiV) generally causes severe encephalitis in humans. Respiratory symptoms are infrequently observed, likely reflecting variations in infection kinetics in human airways. Supporting this idea, we recently identified individual differences in NiV replication kinetics in cultured airway epithelia from different human donors. As type III interferons (IFN-\u03bb) represent major players in the defence mechanism against viral infection of the respiratory mucosa, we studied IFN-\u03bb induction and antiviral activity in NiV-infected primary differentiated human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEpCs) cultured under air-liquid interface conditions. Our studies revealed that IFN-\u03bb was upregulated in airway epithelia upon NiV infection. We also show that IFN-\u03bb pretreatment efficiently inhibited NiV replication. Interestingly, the antiviral activity of IFN-\u03bb varied in HBEpCs from two different donors. Increased sensitivity to IFN-\u03bb was associated with higher expression levels of IFN-\u03bb receptors, enhanced phosphorylation of STAT1, as well as enhanced induction of interferon-stimulated gene expression. These findings suggest that individual variations in IFN-\u03bb receptor expression affecting IFN responsiveness can play a functional role for NiV replication kinetics in human respiratory epithelial cells of different donors.", " Anemia is a well-recognized risk factor for both bleeding and ischemic events after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). We sought to determine the impact of baseline anemia on dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) cessation patterns \u22642 years after PCI and the subsequent risk of clinical adverse events. METHODS AND RESULTS PARIS (Patterns of Non-Adherence to Dual Anti-Platelet Regimen in Stented Patients) was a prospective multicenter observational registry of PCI-treated patients (n=5018). Anemia was defined as baseline Hb (hemoglobin) <12 g/dL for men and <11 g/dL for women. DAPT cessation modes included physician-recommended discontinuation, temporary interruption (\u226414 days), and disruption due to bleeding or noncompliance. The primary end point was 2-year major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), a composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, or target vessel revascularization. We identified 824 (18%) anemic and 4194 (82%) nonanemic patients. Anemic patients were older and had a higher rate of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and prior PCI. DAPT interruption and disruption were significantly more common in anemic patients throughout 2 years after PCI, whereas physician-recommended discontinuation occurred more often in anemic patients during the first year after PCI and in nonanemic patients during the second year. The 2-year adjusted risks of MACE and Bleeding Academic Research Consortium 3 or 5 bleeding events were significantly higher in anemic patients. Compared with uninterrupted DAPT, disruption, but not interruption and physician-recommended discontinuation, was associated with a higher risk of myocardial infarction in nonanemic patients and a higher risk of both myocardial infarction and MACE in anemic patients. There was no significant interaction between anemia and risk of clinical outcomes associated with each DAPT cessation mode. CONCLUSIONS Baseline anemia was associated with a significantly higher adjusted risk of MACE and major bleeding. Physicians more frequently recommend DAPT discontinuation to anemic patients during the first year, and to nonanemic patients during the second year after PCI. DAPT disruption was associated with a higher risk of MACE outcomes.", "Coronavirus replication is associated with intracellular membrane rearrangements in infected cells, resulting in the formation of double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) and other membranous structures that are referred to as replicative organelles (ROs). The latter provide a structural scaffold for viral replication/transcription complexes (RTCs) and help to sequester RTC components from recognition by cellular factors involved in antiviral host responses. There is increasing evidence that plus-strand RNA (+RNA) virus replication, including RO formation and virion morphogenesis, affects cellular lipid metabolism and critically depends on enzymes involved in lipid synthesis and processing. Here, we investigated the role of cytosolic phospholipase A2\u03b1 (cPLA2\u03b1) in coronavirus replication using a low-molecular-weight nonpeptidic inhibitor, pyrrolidine-2 (Py-2). The inhibition of cPLA2\u03b1 activity, which produces lysophospholipids (LPLs) by cleaving at the sn-2 position of phospholipids, had profound effects on viral RNA and protein accumulation in human coronavirus 229E-infected Huh-7 cells. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that DMV formation in infected cells was significantly reduced in the presence of the inhibitor. Furthermore, we found that (i) viral RTCs colocalized with LPL-containing membranes, (ii) cellular LPL concentrations were increased in coronavirus-infected cells, and (iii) this increase was diminished in the presence of the cPLA2\u03b1 inhibitor Py-2. Py-2 also displayed antiviral activities against other viruses representing the Coronaviridae and Togaviridae families, while members of the Picornaviridae were not affected. Taken together, the study provides evidence that cPLA2\u03b1 activity is critically involved in the replication of various +RNA virus families and may thus represent a candidate target for broad-spectrum antiviral drug development.IMPORTANCE Examples of highly conserved RNA virus proteins that qualify as drug targets for broad-spectrum antivirals remain scarce, resulting in increased efforts to identify and specifically inhibit cellular functions that are essential for the replication of RNA viruses belonging to different genera and families. The present study supports and extends previous conclusions that enzymes involved in cellular lipid metabolism may be tractable targets for broad-spectrum antivirals. We obtained evidence to show that a cellular phospholipase, cPLA2\u03b1, which releases fatty acid from the sn-2 position of membrane-associated glycerophospholipids, is critically involved in coronavirus replication, most likely by producing lysophospholipids that are required to form the specialized membrane compartments in which viral RNA synthesis takes place. The importance of this enzyme in coronavirus replication and DMV formation is supported by several lines of evidence, including confocal and electron microscopy, viral replication, and lipidomics studies of coronavirus-infected cells treated with a highly specific cPLA2\u03b1 inhibitor.", "UNLABELLED Combined treatment of advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) with radiotherapy and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor cetuximab improves clinical outcome in comparison to radiotherapy alone but is effective only in a few cases. To select those patients most likely to benefit from EGFR inhibition, it can be advantageous to quantify the tumor EGFR status before and possibly during therapy. The aim of this study was to develop and characterize the (111)In-cetuximab-F(ab')2 tracer to image EGFR targeting in vivo. METHODS The affinity and internalization kinetics of (111)In-cetuximab-F(ab')2 were determined in vitro. The optimal protein-fragment dose for imaging was determined in nude mice with a subcutaneous head and neck carcinoma model (FaDu). Mice with FaDu tumors were imaged using ultra-high-resolution SPECT with (111)In-cetuximab-F(ab')2 or (111)In-cetuximab IgG at 4, 24, 48, and 168 h after injection. Tumor tracer uptake was determined on micro-SPECT and autoradiography images of tumor sections. Immunohistochemical staining was used to analyze EGFR expression in the tumor. RESULTS In vitro, more than 50% of (111)In-cetuximab-F(ab')2 was internalized into FaDu cells within 24 h. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of (111)In-cetuximab-F(ab')2 and (111)In-cetuximab was similar: 0.42 \u00b1 0.16 nM versus 0.28 \u00b1 0.14 nM, respectively. The protein dose-escalation study showed that the highest uptake of (111)In-cetuximab-F(ab')2 in tumors was obtained at doses of 10 \u03bcg/mouse or less (13.5 \u00b1 5.2 percentage injected dose per gram [%ID/g]). Tumor uptake of (111)In-cetuximab was significantly higher (26.9 \u00b1 3.3 %ID/g, P < 0.01). However, because of rapid blood clearance, tumor-to-blood ratios at 24 h after injection were significantly higher for (111)In-cetuximab-F(ab')2 (31.4 \u00b1 3.8 vs. 1.7 \u00b1 0.2, respectively; P < 0.001). The intratumoral distribution of (111)In-cetuximab-F(ab')2 correlated well with the immunohistochemical distribution of EGFR (r = 0.64 \u00b1 0.06, P < 0.0001). micro-SPECT images of (111)In-cetuximab-F(ab')2 clearly showed preferential uptake in the tumor from 4 h onward, with superior tumor-to-background contrast at 24 h, compared with (111)In-cetuximab (107.0 \u00b1 17.0 vs. 69.7 \u00b1 3.9, respectively; P < 0.05). CONCLUSION (111)In-cetuximab-F(ab')2 displays higher tumor-to-blood ratios early after injection than (111)In-cetuximab in an HNSCC model, making it more suitable for EGFR visualization and potentially for selecting patients for treatment with EGFR inhibitors.", "Vein graft bypass surgery is a common treatment for occlusive arterial disease; however, long-term success is limited by graft failure due to thrombosis, intimal hyperplasia, and atherosclerosis. The goal of this article is to demonstrate a method for placing bilateral venous interposition grafts in a rabbit, then transducing the grafts with a gene transfer vector that achieves durable transgene expression. The method allows the investigation of the biological roles of genes and their protein products in normal vein graft homeostasis. It also allows the testing of transgenes for the activities that could prevent vein graft failure, e.g., whether the expression of a transgene prevents the neointimal growth, reduces the vascular inflammation, or reduces atherosclerosis in rabbits fed with a high-fat diet. During an initial survival surgery, the segments of right and left external jugular vein are excised and placed bilaterally as reversed end-to-side common carotid artery interposition grafts. During a second survival surgery, performed 28 days later, each of the grafts is isolated from the circulation with vascular clips and the lumens are filled (via an arteriotomy) with a solution containing a helper-dependent adenoviral (HDAd) vector. After a 20-min incubation, the vector solution is aspirated, the arteriotomy is repaired, and flow is restored. The veins are harvested at time points dictated by individual experimental protocols. The 28-day delay between the graft placement and the transduction is necessary to ensure the adaptation of the vein graft to the arterial circulation. This adaptation avoids rapid loss of transgene expression that occurs in vein grafts transduced before or immediately after grafting. The method is unique in its ability to achieve durable, stable transgene expression in grafted veins. Compared to other large animal vein graft models, rabbits have advantages of low cost and easy handling. Compared to rodent vein graft models, rabbits have larger and easier-to-manipulate blood vessels that provide abundant tissue for analysis.", "Importance Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in December 2019, causing human coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has now spread into a worldwide pandemic. The pulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 have been well described in the literature. Two similar human coronaviruses that cause Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-1) are known to cause disease in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Emerging evidence suggests COVID-19 has neurologic consequences as well. Observations This review serves to summarize available information regarding coronaviruses in the nervous system, identify the potential tissue targets and routes of entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the central nervous system, and describe the range of clinical neurological complications that have been reported thus far in COVID-19 and their potential pathogenesis. Viral neuroinvasion may be achieved by several routes, including transsynaptic transfer across infected neurons, entry via the olfactory nerve, infection of vascular endothelium, or leukocyte migration across the blood-brain barrier. The most common neurologic complaints in COVID-19 are anosmia, ageusia, and headache, but other diseases, such as stroke, impairment of consciousness, seizure, and encephalopathy, have also been reported. Conclusions and Relevance Recognition and understanding of the range of neurological disorders associated with COVID-19 may lead to improved clinical outcomes and better treatment algorithms. Further neuropathological studies will be crucial to understanding the pathogenesis of the disease in the central nervous system, and longitudinal neurologic and cognitive assessment of individuals after recovery from COVID-19 will be crucial to understand the natural history of COVID-19 in the central nervous system and monitor for any long-term neurologic sequelae.", " Adult diaphragmatic hernia is a rare case and usually present with various clinical manifestations. Surgery can be done by thoracic and abdominal approaches. In emergency cases, mostly performed by abdominal approach. The use of mesh to close the defect is currently emerging as a viable option. PRESENTATION OF CASE We report a case of 70-year-old woman with complaints of shortness of breath and abdominal pain. The patient had a history of laparoscopic surgery with the installation of an anti-adhesive mesh for diaphragmatic hernia seven months before admission. Chest X-ray and Computed Tomography (CT) scan found recurrence of diaphragmatic hernia. The patient then received laparotomy showing diaphragmatic hernia with contents in the form of transverse colon, ileum, gastric and omentum. The self-attached mesh was placed on the supra-diaphragm with abdominal approach. The patient was hospitalised four days after surgery. At two weeks and six months follow-up, no complaints were found. CT scan and chest X-ray were within normal limits. DISCUSSION We did a modified technique in managing the recurrence and adhesion of the diaphragmatic hernia using the hernia mesh attached onto the superior side of the diaphragm to minimise the complications and recurrences. CONCLUSIONS Transabdominal supradiaphragmatic self-attached mesh for recurrent diaphragmatic hernia can be considered to be an alternative treatment for recurrent diaphragmatic hernia in an emergency setting because this procedure is relatively easier, safer, causes fewer postoperative complications, and can prevent recurrence.", "Background Radiology is an interdisciplinary field dedicated to the diagnosis and treatment of numerous diseases and is involved in the development of multimodal treatment concepts. Method Interdisciplinary case management, a broad spectrum of diagnostic imaging facilities and dedicated endovascular radiological treatment options are valuable tools that allow radiology to set up an interdisciplinary center for vascular anomalies. Results Image-based diagnosis combined with endovascular treatment options is an essential tool for the treatment of patients with highly complex vascular diseases. These vascular anomalies can affect numerous parts of the body so that a multidisciplinary treatment approach is required for optimal patient care. Conclusion This paper discusses the possibilities and challenges regarding effective and efficient patient management in connection with the formation of an interdisciplinary center for vascular anomalies with strengthening of the clinical role of radiologists. Key points \u00b7 Vascular anomalies, which include vascular tumors and malformations, are complex to diagnose and treat.. \u00b7 There are far more patients with vascular anomalies requiring therapy than interdisciplinary centers for vascular anomalies - there is currently a shortage of dedicated interdisciplinary centers for vascular anomalies in Germany that can provide dedicated care for affected patients.. \u00b7 Radiology includes a broad spectrum of diagnostic and minimally invasive therapeutic tools which allow the formation of an interdisciplinary center for vascular anomalies for effective, efficient and comprehensive patient management..

AIMS The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of endovascular treatment on clinical and radiological outcome in everyday clinical practice. METHODS We compared the rates of good outcome (modified Rankin scale \u2264 2 at discharge), in-hospital death, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhages, and infarct sizes in patients with distal intracranial carotid artery, M1 and M2 occlusions during two time periods. RESULTS From January 2008 to October 2012, a total of 509 patients were treated with intravenous thrombolysis and from November 2012 to December 2014, a total of 270 patients received endovascular treatment with stent retrievers (with or without intravenous thrombolysis). Significantly, more patients in the endovascular treatment group than in the intravenous thrombolysis group had a good outcome (37% vs. 27%, p < 0.01). The infarct sizes were significantly smaller after endovascular treatment than intravenous thrombolysis, whereas the symptomatic intracranial hemorrhages rates and in-hospital mortality were comparable between both treatment groups. The positive impact of endovascular treatment on clinical outcome was most pronounced in patients \u226575 years (31% endovascular treatment vs. 19% intravenous thrombolysis, p < 0.01), in patients with M1 occlusions (43% endovascular treatment vs. 25% intravenous thrombolysis, p < 0.01) and in patients with an admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale \u2265 14 (24% endovascular treatment vs. 11% intravenous thrombolysis, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION In everyday clinical practice and compared with intravenous thrombolysis, endovascular treatment significantly improved clinical outcome and was associated with smaller infarctions. This beneficial effect appeared to be highest in older patients, more severely affected patients, and in those with M1 occlusions.", "PURPOSE To describe a novel technique for multimodality positron emission tomography (PET) fusion-guided interventions that combines cone-beam computed tomography (CT) with PET/CT before the procedure. MATERIALS AND METHODS Subjects were selected among patients scheduled for a biopsy or ablation procedure. The lesions were not visible with conventional imaging methods or did not have uniform uptake on PET. Clinical success was defined by adequate histopathologic specimens for molecular profiling or diagnosis and by lack of enhancement on follow-up imaging for ablation procedures. Time to target (time elapsed between the completion of the initial cone-beam CT scan and first tissue sample or treatment), total procedure time (time from the moment the patient was on the table until the patient was off the table), and number of times the needle was repositioned were recorded. RESULTS Seven patients underwent eight procedures (two ablations and six biopsies). Registration and procedures were completed successfully in all cases. Clinical success was achieved in all biopsy procedures and in one of the two ablation procedures. The needle was repositioned once in one biopsy procedure only. On average, the time to target was 38 minutes (range 13-54 min). Total procedure time was 95 minutes (range 51-240 min, which includes composite ablation). On average, fluoroscopy time was 2.5 minutes (range 1.3-6.2 min). CONCLUSIONS An integrated cone-beam CT software platform can enable PET-guided biopsies and ablation procedures without the need for additional specialized hardware.", "Patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) often harbor significant disease burden within the CNS, specifically craniospinal-axis hemangioblastomas and endolymphatic sac tumors (ELSTs). The majority (60-80%) of patients with VHL harbor hemangioblastomas, and 10-15% will develop ELSTs. Advances in the understanding of the natural history and outcomes associated with the surgical management of VHL-associated tumors have led to improved management of patients with VHL. Optimizing indications for surgical intervention and refining of surgical techniques for these lesions can reduce patient morbidity associated with the management of this syndrome. In this article, we review the various aspects of perioperative management of patients with VHL, surgical indications and general operative principles for the management of hemangioblastomas and ELSTs, and outcomes associated with the surgical treatment of these tumors.", " Some patients develop recurrence after curative resection and adjuvant chemotherapy. S-1, an oral fluoropyrimidine, is one of the standard regimens in adjuvant chemotherapy, and is also used in first-line treatment for advanced/metastatic gastric cancer. It is controversial as to whether the same treatment strategy can be applied for patients who develop recurrence after adjuvant chemotherapy and those who did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy. To investigate this issue, we compared the outcomes of patients who developed recurrences after treatment with or without adjuvant chemotherapy using the results of the Adjuvant Chemotherapy Trial of S-1 for Gastric Cancer (ACTS-GC). METHODS Patients who had confirmed recurrence in the ACTS-GC trial were analyzed. We defined 2 independent cohorts. Cohort 1 patients were divided by whether they received adjuvant chemotherapy (adjuvant S-1 group and surgery-only group). Cohort 2 patients were divided by whether they received a regimen including S-1 (IS) or not including S-1 (NIS) after recurrence. RESULTS A total of 375 patients experienced recurrence (160 in the adjuvant S-1 group and 215 in the surgery-only group). In cohort 1, the median time from recurrence to death (TFRD) was 11.4 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.4-13.9) in the adjuvant S-1 group and 11.3 months (95% CI, 9.7-13.1) in the surgery-only group (hazard ratio [HR], 1.05; 95% CI, 0.84-1.31). In cohort 2, 292 patients received chemotherapy after recurrence and were divided into the IS (n = 189) or the NIS group (n = 103). The median TFRD was 13.9 months (95% CI, 12.7-15.6) in the IS group and 8.1 months (95% CI, 6.6-9.7) in the NIS group (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.45-0.76), and there was no significant interaction between the adjuvant S-1 group and surgery-only group. CONCLUSION Adjuvant chemotherapy with S-1 prolonged overall survival without influencing the TFRD. The same treatment strategy may be applied for patients who develop recurrence after adjuvant chemotherapy and those who did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy. TRIAL REGISTRATION NCT00152217 . First Posted on September 9, 2005.", " In obese individuals, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is common but often goes undiagnosed, and therefore untreated. The presence of significant fibrosis is a key determinant of NAFLD progression, and liver steatosis has substantial cardiovascular implications. We aimed to determine the diagnostic accuracy of common noninvasive diagnostic tests for steatosis and fibrosis in the obese. METHODS We recruited 182 severely and morbidly obese individuals undergoing bariatric surgery (age 44 \u00b1 12 years, body mass index 45.1 \u00b1 8.3 kg/m2). Medical history, blood tests and liver biopsy were taken on the day of surgery. Serum steatosis and fibrosis scores were calculated. In a subgroup of patients, transient elastography with controlled attenuation parameter (TE/CAP) (n = 82) and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) (n = 49) were performed. RESULTS 1H-MRS had excellent diagnostic accuracy for steatosis, with strong correlation to steatosis (r = 0.647, p < 0.001), good AUROC (0.852, p = 0.001), sensitivity (81.3%) and specificity (87.5%). However, due to low feasibility in this cohort (65.3% success), this was substantially decreased with intention-to-diagnose analysis (sensitivity 50.0%, specificity 60.9%). CAP had good feasibility (80.5%), and performed better in intention-to-diagnose analysis (AUROC 0.688, sensitivity 84.8%, specificity 47.2%). Serum steatosis scores performed poorly, with comparable accuracy to ALT. For significant fibrosis, TE had the best accuracy (AUROC 0.903, p = 0.007), which remained reasonable after intention-to-diagnose analysis (sensitivity 100%, specificity 59.0%). A combination approach using CAP with ALT for steatosis and TE with Forn index for fibrosis yielded reasonable overall accuracy. CONCLUSIONS 1H-MRS and TE/CAP had greatest accuracy for NAFLD-related steatosis and fibrosis. Failure rates in obesity significantly diminished diagnostic ability. Use of a combination of serum and imaging tests improved overall feasibility of assessment and diagnostic accuracy in obese individuals.", "/OBJECTIVE Laparoscopic distal splenopancreatectomy (DSP) is an effective and safe surgical modality for treating benign and borderline distal pancreatic tumors, but rarely for pancreatic cancer. This study aimed to examine the feasibility, effectiveness, and safety of laparoscopic versus laparotomic DSP in pancreatic body-tail cancer (PBTC) patients. METHODS Thirty-four PBTC patients were consecutively and retrospectively hospitalized for elective laparoscopic DSP (n = 11) or laparotomy (n = 23) between January 2007 and December 2011. The primary outcome measure was mean overall survival (OS). RESULTS All patients underwent DSP via laparoscopy or laparotomy as scheduled and were followed-up for 12-72 months. The two groups showed statistically similar mean operative time (laparoscopy vs. laparotomy, 150 \u00b1 54 vs. 160 \u00b1 48 min), median volume of intraoperative bleeding (100 [50-400] vs. 150 [50-350] ml), and rate of postoperative pancreatic fistula (18.2 vs. 21.7 %). The laparoscopy group had a significantly shorter median duration of hospitalization (5 [3-12] vs. 8 [7-22] d, P < 0.05). All patients had a clear resection margin and showed statistically similar tumor size (2.8 \u00b1 1.5 vs. 3.1 \u00b1 1.7 cm), number of lymph nodes dissected (14.8 \u00b1 4.5 vs. 16.1 \u00b1 5.7), and mean OS (42.0 \u00b1 8.6 vs. 54.0 \u00b1 5.8 mo, P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic DSP is a feasible, effective, and safe alternative to laparotomy in carefully selected PBTC patients and is associated with a more rapid postoperative recovery.", " Inflow into an aneurysm sac immediately following flow diverter (FD) treatment is an assumed cause of delayed aneurysmal rupture. The significance of delayed posttreatment residual flow occurring months after FD treatment is unknown. CASE DESCRIPTION A 76-year-old woman with a large intracranial aneurysm measuring 23.0 \u00d7 18.1 mm in the cavernous segment of the right internal carotid artery was treated with placement of a single FD (Pipeline Embolization Device, Covidien, Irvine, California, USA). Postprocedure digital subtraction angiography (DSA) demonstrated flow stagnation inside the aneurysm dome. The patient was discharged 9 days post procedure without new neurologic deficits. A 6-month follow-up DSA demonstrated delayed posttreatment residual flow into the aneurysm sac. Although she was scheduled for additional FD placement because of concern for aneurysmal rupture, the operation was not conducted due to an interim motor vehicle accident. Oral treatment with aspirin (100 mg/day) and clopidogrel (75 mg/day) was continued during her recovery. DSA performed 12 months post procedure showed that the aneurysm had completely thrombosed. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that delayed post-treatment residual flow into an aneurysm may form part of the normal clinical course post FD placement and may not preclude eventual thrombosis of the aneurysm. Larger studies are needed to determine whether more frequent follow-up DSAs after FD placement are necessary and whether all patients exhibiting delayed post-treatment residual flow into an aneurysm require additional FD placement or if watchful waiting is a more suitable course.", "OBJECTIVES Minimally invasive surgery is accepted for early-stage lung cancer, but its role in locally advanced disease is controversial, especially using a robotic platform. The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the safety and effectiveness of robot-assisted resection in patients with Stage IIIA non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or carcinoid tumours in the series as a whole and in different subgroups according to adjuvant treatment. METHODS This was a retrospective multicentre study of consecutive patients with clinically evident or occult N2 disease (210 NSCLC and 13 carcinoid) who, in 2007-2016, underwent robot-assisted resection at 7 high-volume centres. Perioperative outcomes, recurrences and overall survival were assessed. RESULTS N2 disease was diagnosed preoperatively in 72 (32%) patients and intraoperatively in 151 (68%) patients. Surgical margins were negative in 98.4% of cases with available data. Thirty-four (15.2%) patients received neoadjuvant treatment, 140 (63%) patients received postoperative treatment, and 49 (22%) patients underwent surgery only. There were 22 (9.9%) conversions to thoracotomy, 23 (10.3%) had serious (Grades III-IV) postoperative morbidity and the mean hospital stay was 5.3 days. Complications and outcomes did not differ significantly between treatment groups. Of the 34 patients who were given neoadjuvant chemotherapy, all had R0 resection, 5 (15%) patients required conversion but none required conversion because of bleeding and 4 (12%) patients had Grade III or IV postoperative complications. After a median of 18 (interquartile range 8-33) months, 3-year overall survival in NSCLC patients was 61.2% and 60.3% (P = 0.6) of patients in the subgroup were given induction treatment. However, overall survival was significantly better (P = 0.012) in NSCLC patients with \u22642 positive nodes (vs >2). Nineteen (8.5%) patients developed local recurrence. CONCLUSIONS Robot-assisted lobectomy is safe and effective in patients with Stage III NSCLC or carcinoid tumours with low conversions and complications. Among patients with NSCLC, including those who were given induction chemotherapy, survival was similar to that reported for open surgery.", "Tuna pyloric caeca aminopeptidase (tAP) is a glycosylated zinc-metalloenzyme containing apparently two identical subunits. The enzyme is reversibly inhibited in a time-dependent manner by amastatin. Slow development of tAP inhibition by this inhibitor could be demonstrated. Dissociation of the complex of tAP with amastatin is also slow. Two molar equivalents of the inhibitor are bound by the enzyme suggesting the presence of one catalytic site in each subunit. Chemical modification of tAP with 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl)carbonyl-metho-p-toluene sulfonate and N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinone revealed the presence of essential acidic amino acid residues probably located at the active site. Compatible with the presence of arginine and tyrosine residues at the catalytic site of most metalloproteinases, tAP is reversibly inhibited by phenylglyoxal and inactivated by tetranitromethane in a time-dependent fashion. The rate of inhibition by these modifiers could be significantly decreased if the enzyme was previously treated with amastatin suggesting that the modified amino acid residues are located at the catalytic site. Diethylpyrocarbonate did not affect the activity of both native and zinc-depleted tAP suggesting that histidine is not involved in the zinc-ligand formation.", "While some risk factors have been identified, the reasons for the disparities in disease progression with COVID-19 are unclear, with some patients developing progressive and severe disease while in others the course is benign. Given this sense of randomness, and in the absence of a definitive treatment, medical professionals can feel helpless. It is useful to remember how much can be done to affect the trajectory of illness, even without a 'magic bullet'. With evidence emerging that late presentation is directly associated with increased mortality, we make the case for increased vigilance in the community and earlier intervention.", " A delta-shaped anastomosis in totally laparoscopic Billroth I gastrectomy could be performed easily and sufficiently using only laparoscopic linear staplers. However, the restricted maneuverability and severe blurring of these staplers along with their limited hemostability induced strain. In this study, we determined the feasibility and safety of performing delta-shaped anastomosis using the Endo GIA\u2122 Reloads with Tri-Staple\u2122 Technology combined with Endo GIA\u2122 Ultra Universal stapler (Tri-Staple) with a particular focus on short-term surgical outcomes. METHODS We performed a single-institutional prospective interventional study (UMIN 000008014). The Tri-Staple was prospectively used on 23 consecutive patients who underwent a curative totally laparoscopic Billroth I gastrectomy with delta-shaped anastomosis. These patients were matched with the 19 patients previously treated using the ENDOPATH(\u00ae) ETS Articulating Linear Cutters (ETS) on clinical and demographic characteristics. RESULTS There were no differences between the groups in anastomosis-related local complications, morbidity, non-anastomosis-related local complications, total systemic complications, and short-term outcomes with the exception of significantly reduced blood loss in the Tri-Staple group (ETS vs. Tri-Staple: 37 [10-306] vs. 15 [5-210] mL, p = 0.02). Intraoperative bleeding from the staple line was significantly reduced in the Tri-Staple group. The postoperative drain indwelling period (ETS vs. Tri-Staple, 6 [4-10] vs. 4 [2-43] days, p = 0.032), fasting period (5 [3-7] vs. 3 [3-24] days, p = 0.022), and hospital stay (14 [10-47] vs. 11 [6-58] days, p = 0.025) were significantly shorter in the Tri-Staple group. There was no mortality in this series. Acceleration assessed as indices of blurring of stapler tip might have a significant adverse influence on staple-line bleeding at stapling sites. CONCLUSION Totally laparoscopic Billroth I distal gastrectomy using Tri-Staple was feasible and safe with favorable short-term surgical outcomes. Reduced blurring while stapling may be a novel endpoint which newly developed stapling devices should target.", " Inadequate intrapleural drug concentrations caused by poor penetration of systemic antibiotics into the pleural cavity is a major cause of treatment failure in empyema. Herein, we describe a novel antibiotic-eluting pigtail catheter coated with electrospun nanofibers used for the sustained release of bactericidal concentrations of penicillin in the pleural space. METHODS Electrospun nanofibers prepared using polylactide-polyglycolide copolymer and penicillin G sodium dissolved in 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol were used to coat the surface of an Fr6 pigtail catheter. The in vitro patterns of drug release were tested by placing the catheter in phosphate-buffered saline. In vivo studies were performed using rabbits treated with penicillin either intrapleurally (Group 1, 20 mg delivered through the catheter) or systemically (Group 2, intramuscular injection, 10 mg/kg). Penicillin concentrations in the serum and pleural fluid were then measured and compared. RESULTS In vitro studies revealed a burst release of penicillin (10% of the total dose) occurring in the first 24 hours, followed by a sustained release in the subsequent 30 days. Intrapleural drug levels were significantly higher in Group 1 than in Group 2 (P<0.001). In the former, penicillin concentrations remained above the minimum inhibitory concentration breakpoint throughout the entire study period. In contrast, serum penicillin levels were significantly higher in Group 2 than in Group 1 (P<0.001). Notably, all Group 2 rabbits showed signs of systemic toxicity (paralytic ileus and weight loss). CONCLUSION We conclude that our antibiotic-eluting catheter may serve as a novel therapeutic option to treat empyema.", "Objective: Present study investigated the mechanism of heart failure associated with coronavirus infection and predicted potential effective therapeutic drugs against heart failure associated with coronavirus infection. Methods: Coronavirus and heart failure were searched in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and omics data were selected to meet experimental requirements. Differentially expressed genes were analyzed using the Limma package in R language to screen for differentially expressed genes. The two sets of differential genes were introduced into the R language cluster Profiler package for gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto gene and genome encyclopedia (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis. Two sets of intersections were taken. A protein interaction network was constructed for all differentially expressed genes using STRING database and core genes were screened. Finally, the apparently accurate treatment prediction platform (EpiMed) independently developed by the team was used to predict the therapeutic drug. Results: The GSE59185 coronavirus data set was searched and screened in the GEO database, and divided into wt group, \u0394E group, \u03943 group, \u03945 group according to different subtypes, and compared with control group. After the difference analysis, 191 up-regulated genes and 18 down-regulated genes were defined. The GEO126062 heart failure data set was retrieved and screened from the GEO database. A total of 495 differentially expressed genes were screened, of which 165 were up-regulated and 330 were down-regulated. Correlation analysis of differentially expressed genes between coronavirus and heart failure was performed. After cross processing, there were 20 GO entries, which were mainly enriched in virus response, virus defense response, type \u2160 interferon response, \u03b3 interferon regulation, innate immune response regulation, negative regulation of virus life cycle, replication regulation of viral genome, etc . There are 5 KEGG pathways, mainly interacting with tumor necrosis factor signaling pathway, IL-17 signaling pathway, cytokine and receptor interaction, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, human giant cells viral infection related. All differentially expressed genes were introduced into the SREING online analysis website for protein interaction network analysis, and core genes such as signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, IL-10, IL17, TNF, interferon regulatory factor 9, 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 1, mitogen-activated protein kinase 3, radical s-adenosyl methionine domain containing 2, c-x-c motif chemokine ligand 10, caspase 3 and other genes were screened. The drugs predicted by EpiMed's apparent precision treatment prediction platform for disease-drug association analysis are mainly TNF-\u03b1 inhibitors, resveratrol, ritonavir, paeony, retinoic acid, forsythia, and houttuynia cordata. Conclusions: The abnormal activation of multiple inflammatory pathways may be the cause of heart failure in patients after coronavirus infection. Resveratrol, ritonavir, retinoic acid, amaranth, forsythia, houttuynia may have therapeutic effects. Future basic and clinical research is warranted to validate present results and hypothesis.", " International treatment guidelines now recognize the importance of thrombus removal to reduce postthrombotic morbidity when treating patients with extensive acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Studies have shown that thrombus resolution with catheter-directed thrombolysis in patients with iliofemoral DVT reduces postthrombotic morbidity, although patients unsuccessfully treated with catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) do not enjoy the same long-term benefit. The purpose of this study is to objectively assess whether the amount of clot reduction at the time of acute therapy correlates with long-term postthrombotic morbidity. METHODS Forty-two patients who underwent catheter-directed and/or pharmacomechanical lysis of iliofemoral DVT were quantitatively evaluated. Patients had their degree of clot lysis quantified and were divided into two main groups for comparison. Group I (n = 33) had >50% clot lysis (mean, 84%) and group II (n = 9) had < or =50% lysis (mean, 42%). At a mean follow-up interval of 14 months, the degree of chronic venous disease was assessed by evaluators blinded to the degree of clot lysis. Evaluation of postthrombotic morbidity was performed using the Villalta scale, and the clinical class of CEAP, and quality-of-life (QOL) was assessed using the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). RESULTS Mean CEAP scores were 0.85 and 3.13 (P = .005), and Villalta scores were 2.38 and 6.25 (P = .009) in group I and group II, respectively. Patient QOL in group I was higher than group II in all parameters. Physical functioning (P = .035), role physical (P = .012), general health (P = .014), vitality (P < .001), and social functioning (P = .012) were all significantly better in group I. Bodily pain (P = .117), role emotional (P = .624), and mental health (P = .096) strongly favored group I patients but did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION Patients with extensive DVT treated with catheter-based interventions to eliminate thrombus suffer relatively little postthrombotic morbidity. The degree of clot lysis directly correlates with long-term outcome. Improved QOL, the Villalta scale, and clinical class of CEAP are linearly correlated with the amount of clot resolution.", "PURPOSE We aim to report outcomes and learning curve of transanal endoscopic operation (TEO) for rectal tumors, using standard laparoscopic instruments under a magnifying laparoscopic monitor view. MATERIALS AND METHODS From January 2012 to July 2014, local excision was performed using a TEO system in 46 consecutive patients with rectal tumors. Patient and tumor characteristics and perioperative outcomes were prospectively assessed. RESULTS The median patient age was 56 years for 15 women and 31 men. The mean tumor size was 1.8 cm, and the mean distance from the anal verge was 7.8 cm. The mean operative time was 85 minutes, and the mean postoperative hospital stay was 4.5 days. The postoperative pathologic diagnosis was adenocarcinoma for 17 patients (37%), adenoma for 4 patients (9%), carcinoid tumor for 23 patients (50%), and leiomyoma and lipoma for the 2 remaining patients (2%). A positive resection margin was documented for 4 patients (9%). No mortality was associated with the procedure although postoperative bleeding, leakage, perianal fistula, fecal incontinence, and voiding difficulty developed in 8 patients. According to the cumulative sum (CUSUM) analysis, the operation time and hospital stay significantly decreased after 17 case experiences. CONCLUSIONS TEO is a feasible and safe treatment option for local excision of rectal tumors. TEO has the advantage of being a precise surgical procedure with a stable and magnifying endoscopic view. However, TEO requires a learning period and a careful selection of patients through proper indications and preoperative diagnostics.", " Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is a promising procedure for the surgical treatment of morbid obesity. We report our 2-year experience with LSG and specifically evaluate the importance of staple-line protection to prevent leakage after the laparoscopic procedure. METHODS One hundred eighteen consecutive patients with BMI > 30 who underwent LSG from January 2006 to February 2009 were included in our study. There were 88 women and 30 men with a mean age of 33.2 \u00b1 9.6 years and a mean BMI of 38.0 \u00b1 6.4 kg/m(2). The first 40 patients (group 1) underwent the operation without any reinforcement procedure and the other 78 patients received reinforcement of the staple-line (group 2). Data including demographics, hospital stay, blood loss, operative time, complications, excess weight loss percentage (EWL%), and gastrointestinal quality of life index (GIQLI) were collected prospectively for evaluation. RESULTS The overall mean operative time was 118.5 \u00b1 37.0 min, mean blood loss was 56.8 \u00b1 56.7 ml, mean hospital stay was 5 \u00b1 3 days. The mean EWL% at 12 and 24 months was 81.5 and 76.0%, respectively. The overall leakage rate was 3.39% (4/118). All leakage occurred in group 1 patients, with a leakage rate of 10% (4/40). Mean preoperative GIQLI was 98.7, and the postoperative GIQLI were 116.4, 115, 112.4, and 97.6 at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively. CONCLUSIONS LSG is an effective obesity treatment to achieve significant weight loss after 24 months. Staple-line reinforcement is strongly recommended for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy to decrease complications.", "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new infectious disease, firstly appeared in Wuhan city and has rapidly spread to 114 countries outside China, which is receiving worldwide attention. As two important means of examination, computed tomography (CT) and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have always been controversial in the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. Here, we report a family cluster case of a father and a son diagnosed as COVID-19 at our hospital, and described the clinical manifestations, laboratory results, CT changes, diagnosis and treatment strategy of these two patients. Focus on the value of these two methods in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, as well as their respective deficiencies. For patient 1 (father), the efficacy of RT-PCR is not satisfactory either in terms of diagnosis or follow-up, which may cause misdiagnosis and delay treatment. For patient 2 (son), the clinical symptoms were not obvious, but CT imaging clearly displayed dynamic changes of the lung lesions. Meanwhile, the two patients respectively underwent five chest CT examinations during their hospitalization and discharge follow-up, showing the potential harm of radiation. Therefore, in clinical work, doctors should make full use of the advantages of CT and RT-PCR, and take other measures to make up for their disadvantages.", " To examine prognostic factors that influence complications after hip fracture surgery. To summarize proposed underlying mechanisms for their influence. METHODS We reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Scoping Review extension. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, AgeLine, Cochrane Library, and reference lists of retrieved studies for studies of prognostic factor/s of postoperative in-hospital medical complication/s among patients 50 years and older treated surgically for non-pathological closed hip fracture, published in English on January 2008-January 2018. We excluded studies of surgery type or in-hospital medications. Screening was duplicated by two independent reviewers. One reviewer completed the extraction with accuracy checks by the second reviewer. We summarized the extent, nature, and proposed underlying mechanisms for the prognostic factors of complications narratively and in a dependency graph. RESULTS We identified 44 prognostic factors of in-hospital complications after hip fracture surgery from 56 studies. Of these, we identified 7 patient factors-dehydration, anemia, hypotension, heart rate variability, pressure risk, nutrition, and indwelling catheter use; and 7 process factors-time to surgery, anesthetic type, transfusion strategy, orthopedic versus geriatric/co-managed care, multidisciplinary care pathway, and potentially modifiable during index hospitalization. We identified underlying mechanisms for 15 of 44 factors. The reported association between 12 prognostic factors and complications was inconsistent across studies. CONCLUSIONS Most factors were reported by one study with no proposed underlying mechanism for their influence. Where reported by more than one study, there was inconsistency in reported associations and the conceptualization of complications differed, limiting comparison across studies. It is therefore not possible to be certain whether intervening on these factors would reduce the rate of complications after hip fracture surgery.", "Autophagy is a well-described degradation mechanism that promotes cell survival upon nutrient starvation and other forms of cellular stresses. In addition, there is growing evidence showing that autophagy can exert a lethal function via autophagic cell death (ACD). As ACD has been implicated in apoptosis-resistant glioblastoma (GBM), there is a high medical need for identifying novel ACD-inducing drugs. Therefore, we screened a library containing 70 autophagy-inducing compounds to induce ATG5-dependent cell death in human MZ-54 GBM cells. Here, we identified three compounds, i.e. loperamide, pimozide, and STF-62247 that significantly induce cell death in several GBM cell lines compared to CRISPR/Cas9-generated ATG5- or ATG7-deficient cells, pointing to a death-promoting role of autophagy. Further cell death analyses conducted using pharmacological inhibitors revealed that apoptosis, ferroptosis, and necroptosis only play minor roles in loperamide-, pimozide- or STF-62247-induced cell death. Intriguingly, these three compounds induce massive lipidation of the autophagy marker protein LC3B as well as the formation of LC3B puncta, which are characteristic of autophagy. Furthermore, loperamide, pimozide, and STF-62247 enhance the autophagic flux in parental MZ-54 cells, but not in ATG5 or ATG7 knockout (KO) MZ-54 cells. In addition, loperamide- and pimozide-treated cells display a massive formation of autophagosomes and autolysosomes at the ultrastructural level. Finally, stimulation of autophagy by all three compounds is accompanied by dephosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a well-known negative regulator of autophagy. In summary, our results indicate that loperamide, pimozide, and STF-62247 induce ATG5- and ATG7-dependent cell death in GBM cells, which is preceded by a massive induction of autophagy. These findings emphasize the lethal function and potential clinical relevance of hyperactivated autophagy in GBM.", " A recent randomized controlled trial (RCT), the Multicenter Randomized CLinical trial of Endovascular treatment for Acute ischemic stroke in the Netherlands (MR CLEAN), demonstrated better outcomes with endovascular treatment compared with medical therapy for acute ischemic stroke (AIS). However, previous trials have provided mixed results regarding the efficacy of endovascular treatment for AIS. A meta-analysis of all available trial data was performed to summarize the available evidence. METHODS A literature search was performed to identify all prospective RCTs comparing endovascular therapies with medical management for AIS. Two datasets were created: (1) all patients randomized after confirmation of large vessel occlusion (LVO) (consistent with the contemporary standard of practice at the majority of centers); and (2) all patients with outcome data who underwent randomization regardless of qualifying vascular imaging. The pre-specified primary outcome measure was modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2 at 90 days. A fixed-effect model was used to determine significance. RESULTS Five prospective RCTs comparing endovascular therapies with medical management were included in dataset 1 (1183 patients) and six were included in dataset 2 (1903 total patients). Endovascular therapies were associated with significantly improved outcomes compared with medical management (OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.29 to 1.16, p=0.0001) for patients with LVO (dataset 1). This benefit persisted when patients from all six RCTs were included, even in the absence of confirmation of LVO (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.54, p=0.019; dataset 2). CONCLUSIONS A meta-analysis of prospective RCTs comparing endovascular therapies with medical management demonstrates superior outcomes in patients randomized to endovascular therapy.", "AIM This study aimed to develop a novel procedure for treating long-gap pure esophageal atresia. This procedure, which entails the combined use of laparoscopy and natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery (NOTES), would enable primary repair without cervical and thoracic incisions and prevent postoperative gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). METHODS Nonsurvival experiments were conducted in 9 pigs to study the technical feasibility. The procedure comprised the following: (1) creation of the disease model by laparoscopic resection of the lower esophagus; (2) laparoscopic fundoplication, complete mobilization of the stomach, and enlargement of the esophageal hiatus; (3) formation of a peroral transesophageal entry site into either the postmediastinum or the right thoracic cavity followed by fashioning a tunnel to the peritoneal cavity; (4) gastric pull-up by using both laparoscopy and NOTES; (5) esophagoesophageal anastomosis using BraceBar\u2122, a prototype of the double T-bar suturing device (Olympus Medical Systems Co., Tokyo, Japan). RESULTS Laparoscopic procedures were performed without complications. The postmediastinal tunnel was successfully created three times with a complication of pleural injury. However, gastric pull-up via this route could not be completed due to porcine anatomical reasons. Gastric pull-up through the right thoracic route was achieved five times in six attempts. Two disorientations and a hemorrhagic death occurred during the procedures. CONCLUSIONS This study showed that combined use of laparoscopy and NOTES enabled gastric pull-up without cervical and thoracic incisions. Our method has the potential of lowering the incidence of GERD and enabling primary repair of this disease.", "OBJECTIVE Intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) accounts for approximately 10% of ischemic strokes. The recent Stenting and Aggressive Medical Management for Preventing Recurrent Stroke in Intracranial Stenosis (SAMMPRIS) study demonstrated a high incidence of perioperative complications (15%) for treatment of ICAD with stenting. Although the incidence of stroke was lower in the medical arm, recurrent stroke was found in 12% of patients despite aggressive medical management, suggesting that intervention may remain a viable option for ICAD if perioperative risk is minimized. Angioplasty without stenting represents an alternative and understudied revascularization treatment for ICAD. Submaximal angioplasty limits the risks of thromboembolism, vessel perforation, and reperfusion hemorrhage that were frequently reported with stenting in the SAMMPRIS trial. The authors conducted a prospective Phase I trial designed to assess the safety of submaximal angioplasty in patients with symptomatic ICAD. METHODS This study was approved by the local institutional review board. Demographic and clinical data were prospectively collected. Angioplasty was performed with a balloon undersized to approximately 50%-70% of the nondiseased vessel diameter in patients with symptomatic ICAD who had angiographically significant stenosis of \u2265 70%. The primary outcome measure was the incidence of periprocedural complications (combined rate of death, stroke, and hemorrhage occurring within 30 days and at 1 year). RESULTS Among the 65 patients with symptomatic ICAD who were screened, 24 had significant angiographic stenosis that met the inclusion criteria of this study. The mean age was 64.08 years (median 65 years; SD \u00b1 11.24 years), most were men (62.5%), and most were white (66.67%). Many patients had concomitants of vascular disease, including hypertension (95.8%), hyperlipidemia (70.83%), smoking history (54.1%), and diabetes mellitus (50.0%). Coronary artery disease (41.66%) and previous stroke or transient ischemic attack (45.83%) were frequently present. Most patients (75%) had anterior circulation stenosis. The mean preprocedure stenosis was 80.16% (median 80%, range 70%-95%). Submaximal angioplasty was performed in patients who met the inclusion criteria, with a mean postangioplasty stenosis rate of 54.62% (median 55.5%, range 31%-78%). Rates of ischemic stroke in the territory of the treated artery were 0% within 30 days and 5.55% (in the only patient who presented with recurrent stroke) at 1 year. The mortality and hemorrhage rates in this series were 0%. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates the safety of the submaximal angioplasty technique, with no permanent periprocedural complications in 24 treated patients.", "Reperfusion therapy for acute stroke has evolved from the initial use of intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) within 3 hours of symptom onset to more recent guideline-recommended use up to 4.5 hours. In addition, endovascular therapy is increasingly utilized for stroke treatment and is typically initiated up to 8 hours after onset. Recent studies demonstrate that imaging of the ischemic penumbra with diffusion/perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can identify subgroups of patients who are likely to improve following successful reperfusion (Target Mismatch profile) and others who are at increased risk for hemorrhage and poor clinical outcomes (Malignant profile). New data indicate that stent retriever devices provide better recanalization efficacy and clinical outcomes than the previously available mechanical thrombectomy devices. Going forward, we believe that the use of penumbral imaging with validated MRI techniques, as well as the currently less well-validated computed tomography (CT) perfusion approach, will maximize benefit and reduce the risk of adverse events and poor outcomes when used both early after stroke onset and at later time points. New trials that feature diffusion/perfusion MRI or CT perfusion-based patient selection for treatment with intravenous tPA and or endovascular therapies versus nonreperfused control groups are planned or in progress. We predict that these trials will confirm the hypothesis that penumbral imaging can enhance patient selection and extend the therapeutic time window for acute ischemic stroke.", "Viral infections are associated with coagulation disorders. All aspects of the coagulation cascade, primary hemostasis, coagulation, and fibrinolysis, can be affected. As a consequence, thrombosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation, hemorrhage, or both, may occur. Investigation of coagulation disorders as a consequence of different viral infections have not been performed uniformly. Common pathways are therefore not fully elucidated. In many severe viral infections there is no treatment other than supportive measures. A better understanding of the pathophysiology behind the association of viral infections and coagulation disorders is crucial for developing therapeutic strategies. This is of special importance in case of severe complications, such as those seen in hemorrhagic viral infections, the incidence of which is increasing worldwide. To date, only a few promising targets have been discovered, meaning the implementation in a clinical context is still hampered. This review discusses non\u2010hemorrhagic and hemorrhagic viruses for which sufficient data on the association with hemostasis and related clinical features is available. This will enable clinicians to interpret research data and place them into a perspective. J. Med.

The endovascular method offers numerous options that render it capable of treating each fistula type by choosing an adequate technique. This advantage along with the advancement in the field has led to fewer complications with higher success rate.", "Lower extremity deep vein thrombosis is a serious medical condition that can result in death or major disability due to pulmonary embolism or post-thrombotic syndrome. Appropriate diagnosis and treatment are required to improve symptoms and salvage the affected limb. Early thrombus clearance rapidly resolves symptoms related to venous obstruction, restores valve function and reduces the incidence of post-thrombotic syndrome. Recently, endovascular treatment has been established as a standard method for early thrombus removal. However, there are a variety of views regarding the indications and procedures among medical institutions and operators. Therefore, we intend to provide evidence-based guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of lower extremity deep vein thrombosis by multidisciplinary consensus. These guidelines are the result of a close collaboration between interventional radiologists and vascular surgeons. The goals of these guidelines are to improve treatment, to serve as a guide to the clinician, and consequently to contribute to public health care.", " esophageal diverticula are classified as 2 types: true diverticula and pseudodiverticula. These disorders result in clinical manifestations such as dysphagia and esophageal reflux. In this study, we evaluated the results of surgical treatment for diverticula. METHODS all patients suffering from symptomatic esophageal diverticulum, who underwent surgical treatment in Ghaem Hospital from 2000 to 2012 and were followed up for at least for one year, were included in the study. Age, sex, clinical manifestations, location, surgical approach, and mortality were evaluated. There were 25 patients (15 men and 10 women) with a mean age of 41 \u00b1 8.3 years. RESULTS the most common site of involvement was inferior (epiphrenic diverticulum). Barium swallow was diagnostic. After surgical treatment, complications occurred in 4 (16%) patients, comprising anastomosis site leakage, hoarseness, atelectasis, and wound infection; all were treated medically. There was no postoperative mortality. All patients experienced an improvement in symptoms during one year of follow-up. CONCLUSION due to the good results and minimal complications postoperatively, surgical treatment is recommended for patients with symptomatic esophageal diverticulum.", "OBJECTIVE Carotid cavernous fistula (CCF) development after Pipeline Embolization Device (PED) treatment of cavernous carotid aneurysms (CCA) can be a challenging pathology to treat for the neurointerventionalist. METHODS A database of all patients whose aneurysms were treated with the PED since its approval by the Food and Drug Administration in 2011 was retrospectively reviewed. Demographic information, aneurysm characteristics, treatment technique, antiplatelet regimen, and follow-up data were collected. A literature review of all papers that describe PED treatment of CCA was then completed. RESULTS A total of 44 patients with 45 CCAs were identified (38 women, 6 men). The mean age was 59.9\u00b19.0 years. The mean maximal aneurysm diameter was 15.9\u00b16.9 mm (mean neck 7.1\u00b13.6 mm). A single PED was deployed in 32 patients, with two PEDs deployed in 10 patients and three PEDs in 3 patients. Adjunctive coiling was performed in 3 patients. Mean follow-up duration based on final imaging (MR angiography or digital subtraction angiography) was 14.1\u00b112.2 months. Five patients (11.4%) developed CCFs in the post-procedural period after PED treatment, all within 2 weeks of device placement. These CCFs were treated with a balloon test occlusion followed by parent artery sacrifice. Our literature review yielded only three reports of CCFs after PED placement, with the largest series having a CCF rate of 2.3%. CONCLUSIONS CCF formation is a known risk of PED treatment of CCA. Although transvenous embolization can be used for treating CCFs, parent artery sacrifice remains a viable option on the basis of these data. Studies support the view that adjunctive coiling may have a protective effect against post-PED CCF formation. None of the coiled aneurysms in our database or in the literature have ruptured. Follow-up data will lead to a better understanding of the safety profile of the PED for CCA.", " Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). There is no specific cure for this disease, and the clinical management mainly depends on supportive treatment. Traditional Chinese medicines (CHM) is widely used in treating COVID-19 in China. METHODS A comprehensive literature search will be conducted. Two methodological trained researchers will read the title, abstract, and full texts and independently select the qualified literature according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. After assessment of the risk of bias and data extraction, we will conduct meta-analyses for outcomes related to COVID-19. The heterogeneity of data will be investigated by Cochrane \u03c7 and I tests. Then publication bias assessment will be conducted by funnel plot analysis and Egger test. RESULTS The results of our research will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. CONCLUSION Our study aims to systematically present the clinical evidence of CHM in the treatment of COVID-19, which will be of guiding significance for further research and clinical practice. OSF REGISTRATION NUMBER 10.17605/OSF.IO/H7GMU.", "Advances in the management of patients in terms of the diagnosis and treatment of hematologic malignancies and treatment-related complications, especially infectious complications, have increased survival time. However, more than half of the patients treated for hematologic malignancies will develop a pulmonary complication during their follow-up, infectious pneumonia remaining the most common diagnosis that should be considered first in regard to its potential severity. Otherwise, new complications that may involve different organs, including the lungs, have been increasingly reported. Currently, over a quarter of lung infiltrates occurring in the context of hematological diseases are due to noninfectious causes. Thus, lung physicians may be increasingly confronted with these lung disorders. Various noninfectious pulmonary complications have been described in the different hematological malignancies; however, these complications are most often studied in the context of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). In this chapter, we will briefly review the lung diseases associated with various hematological malignancies before focusing on noninfectious pulmonary complications following allogeneic HSCT.", "Genetic alleles that contribute to enhanced susceptibility or resistance to viral infections and virally induced diseases have often been first identified in mice before humans due to the significant advantages of the murine system for genetic studies. Herein we review multiple discoveries that have revealed significant insights into virus-host interactions, all made using genetic mapping tools in mice. Factors that have been identified include innate and adaptive immunity genes that contribute to host defense against pathogenic viruses such as herpes viruses, flaviviruses, retroviruses, and coronaviruses. Understanding the genetic mechanisms that affect infectious disease outcomes will aid the development of personalized treatment and preventive strategies for pathogenic infections.", " Despite good clinical outcome proposals, there has been relatively little published regarding the use of non-metallic implant for patellar fracture fixation. The purpose of the study was to perform a systematic literature review to summarize and evaluate the clinical studies that described techniques for treating patella fractures using non-metallic implants. METHODS A comprehensive literature search was systematically performed to evaluate all studies included in the literature until November 2015. The following search terms were used: patellar fracture, patella suture, patella absorbable, patella screw, patella cerclage. Two investigators independently reviewed all abstracts and the selection of these abstracts was then performed based on inclusion and/or exclusion criteria. RESULTS A total of 9 studies involving 123 patients were included. Patients had a mean age of 33.7 years and were followed up for a mean of 18.9 months. The most common method for fracture fixations included the use of suture material. Good clinical outcomes were reported among all studies. Thirteen patients (10.5%) presented complications, while 4 patients (3.2%) required additional surgery for implant removal. CONCLUSION There is a paucity of literature focused on the use of non-metallic implant for patellar fracture fixation. However, this systematic review showed that non-metallic implants are able to deliver good clinical outcomes reducing the rate of surgical complications and re-operation. These results may assist surgeons in choosing to use alternative material such as sutures to incorporate into their routine practice or to consider it, in order to reduce the rate of re-operation.", "Reperfusion therapy for acute stroke has evolved from the initial use of intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) within 3 hours of symptom onset to more recent guideline-recommended use up to 4.5 hours.

Addition of an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene lining to a nitinol stent frame, as found in the VIABAHN endoprosthesis, mitigates the ingrowth of intimal hyperplasia. We compared the long-term outcomes of complex superficial femoral artery disease intervention using the VIABAHN endoprosthesis to those obtained with bare nitinol stent implantation. METHODS One hundred forty-eight patients with symptomatic complex superficial femoral artery disease (TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus I class C and D lesions, accompanied by intermittent claudication or ischemic rest pain) were randomized to endovascular intervention using either bare nitinol stent implantation (76 patients) or nonheparin-bonded VIABAHN endoprosthesis deployment (72 patients). Patency, limb hemodynamics, and quality of life were evaluated at 1, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months following intervention. RESULTS The average treated lesion measured 18 \u00b1 8 cm in length, and 58.8% of lesions displayed segmental or complete occlusion. At 3 years, primary patency rates (defined by peak systolic velocity ratio \u2264 2.0 and no target lesion revascularization) did not significantly differ between patients treated with the VIABAHN stent graft and those who received a bare nitinol stent (24.2% vs 25.9%; P = .392). Stent fractures were significantly more common in bare nitinol stents (50.0%) than in the VIABAHN endoprostheses (2.6%). Primary-assisted patency rates were higher in those receiving bare nitinol stents than the VIABAHN stent graft (88.8% vs 69.8%; P = .04), although secondary patency rates did not differ between bare nitinol stent and stent graft recipients (89.3% vs 79.5%; P = .304). There were no instances of procedure-related mortality or amputation. The hemodynamic improvement and quality measures improved equally in both groups. CONCLUSIONS The long-term outcomes of complex superficial femoral artery disease intervention using the VIABAHN endograft and bare nitinol stents are similar. Although primary patency rates are low in both study arms, excellent primary-assisted and secondary patency rates were achieved, with sustained augmentation of limb perfusion and quality-of-life measures. Patency rates diminish most rapidly in the first year after device implantation.", "OBJECTIVE Patients with paraclinoid aneurysms commonly present with visual impairment. They have traditionally been treated with clipping or coiling, but flow diversion (FD) has recently been introduced as an alternative treatment modality. Although there is still initial aneurysm thrombosis, FD is hypothesized to reduce mass effect, which may decompress the optic nerve when treating patients with visually symptomatic paraclinoid aneurysms. The authors performed a meta-analysis to compare vision outcomes following clipping, coiling, or FD of paraclinoid aneurysms in patients who presented with visual impairment. METHODS A systematic literature review was performed using the PubMed and Web of Science databases. Studies published in English between 1980 and 2016 were included if they reported preoperative and postoperative visual function in at least 5 patients with visually symptomatic paraclinoid aneurysms (cavernous segment through ophthalmic segment) treated with clipping, coiling, or FD. Neuroophthalmological assessment was used when reported, but subjective patient reports or objective visual examination findings were also acceptable. RESULTS Thirty-nine studies that included a total of 2458 patients (520 of whom presented with visual symptoms) met the inclusion criteria, including 307 visually symptomatic cases treated with clipping (mean follow-up 26 months), 149 treated with coiling (mean follow-up 17 months), and 64 treated with FD (mean follow-up 11 months). Postoperative vision in these patients was classified as improved, unchanged, or worsened compared with preoperative vision. A pooled analysis showed preoperative visual symptoms in 38% (95% CI 28%-50%) of patients with paraclinoid aneurysms. The authors found that vision improved in 58% (95% CI 48%-68%) of patients after clipping, 49% (95% CI 38%-59%) after coiling, and 71% (95% CI 55%-84%) after FD. Vision worsened in 11% (95% CI 7%-17%) of patients after clipping, 9% (95% CI 2%-18%) after coiling, and 5% (95% CI 0%-20%) after FD. New visual deficits were found in patients with intact baseline vision at a rate of 1% (95% CI 0%-3%) for clipping, 0% (95% CI 0%-2%) for coiling, and 0% (95% CI 0%-2%) for FD. CONCLUSIONS To the authors' knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis to assess vision outcomes after treatment for paraclinoid aneurysms. The authors found that 38% of patients with these aneurysms presented with visual impairment. These data also demonstrated a high rate of visual improvement after FD without a significant difference in the rate of worsened vision or iatrogenic visual impairment compared with clipping and coiling. These findings suggest that FD is an effective option for treatment of visually symptomatic paraclinoid aneurysms.", " Traditionally, radical nephrectomy for Wilms tumor has been performed through an open approach. Advances in minimally invasive surgery have led to the application of these techniques to malignant lesions, including Wilms tumor. We aim to present our experience with laparoscopic nephrectomy (LN) for Wilms tumor. PATIENTS AND METHODS Four patients with Wilms tumor were treated preoperatively with chemotherapy and afterwards underwent an LN and lymph node sampling. Four ports were placed and the tumors were removed without morcellation in an endoscopic bag through an incision by extending the umbilical or the suprapubic port site. RESULTS The average age at the time of surgery was 3 years and 7 months (range, 23 mo to 6 y). There were no intraoperative complications and the blood loss was minimal in all cases. The mean operative time was 125 minutes (range, 90 to 160 min). Among our patients, we had 2 stage IV and 2 stage I cases. The mean time of hospitalization was 3 days (range, 2 to 4 d). There were no long-term complications at the mean follow-up of 3 years and 6 months. CONCLUSIONS LN for Wilms tumor may be considered as an option in selected patients. Minimally invasive surgery allows the surgeon to follow all the oncologic principles required for surgical treatment of this neoplasm and provides the advantages of these techniques for cancer patients. Preoperative chemotherapy is essential to decrease tumor size and facilitate the dissection avoiding tumor rupture.", " Incisional ventral hernia is one of the most common surgical complications after laparotomy. Laparoscopic repair of incisional ventral hernia has been conducted recently, and the advantages of this procedure have been reported. However, in large orifice cases, the recurrence rate is increased. To improve recurrence rates in large cases, a hybrid method combining laparoscopic primary closure and mesh repair can be applied. MATERIALS AND SURGICAL TECHNIQUE Monofilament thread was inserted into the abdominal cavity for hernia closure and pulled from the other side of the orifice. The same procedure was performed from the upper side to the lower side without closure, and all thread was placed in line. Both sides of the thread were then introduced to the midline of the incision through a subcutaneous route. This procedure was conducted with an introducer. All threads were tied, and then a mesh was placed. DISCUSSION Hybrid techniques already combine mini-laparotomy for hernia closure and subsequent laparoscopic intraoperative onlay mesh for reinforcement, but such techniques require laparotomy. In our technique, closure of the linea alba does not require laparotomy. All procedures were performed laparoscopically. This procedure is very easy and safe, and does not require the abdominal cavity to be opened. Thus, hybrid methods are effective for treating cases of incisional hernia involving a large orifice.", "OBJECTIVES Watertight dural closure is imperative after neurosurgical procedures because inadequately treated leakage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can have serious consequences. In this study, the authors test the use of a new gelatin glue as a dural sealant in in vitro and in vivo canine models of transdural CSF leakage. METHODS The in vitro model was sutured semicircles of canine dura mater and artificial dural substitute. The sutures were sealed with gelatin glue (n = 20), fibrin glue (n = 20), or a polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based hydrogel sealant (n = 20). Each sample was set in a device to measure water pressure, and pressure was increased until leakage occurred. Bonding strength was subjectively evaluated. The in vivo model was dogs who underwent dural excision and received either no sealant (control group; n = 5) or gelatin glue sealant (n = 5) before dural closure. Twenty-eight days post-surgery, the maximum intracranial pressure was measured at the cisterna magna using Valsalva maneuver and tissue adhesion was evaluated. RESULTS The water pressure at which leakage occurred in the in vitro model was higher with gelatin glue (76\u00b75 \u00b1 39\u00b78 mmHg) than with fibrin glue (38\u00b73 \u00b1 27\u00b74 mmHg, P < 0\u00b7001) or the PEG-based hydrogel sealant (46\u00b73 \u00b1 20\u00b79 mmHg, P = 0\u00b7007). Bonding strength was higher for the gelatin glue than fibrin glue (P < 0\u00b7001) or PEG-based hydrogel sealant (P = 0\u00b7001). The maximum intracranial pressure in the in vivo model was higher for the gelatin glue group (59\u00b70 \u00b1 2\u00b72 mmHg) than the control group (13\u00b78 \u00b1 4\u00b70 mmHg, P < 0\u00b7001). Tissue adhesion was lower for the gelatin glue group than the control group (P = 0\u00b7005). DISCUSSION The new gelatin glue provides an effective watertight closure when used as an adjunct to sutured dural repair.", " AND OBJECTIVES: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a routine clinical procedure performed to treat patients with haematological malignancies, primary immune deficiencies or metabolic disorders. Infections during lymphopenia after allogeneic HSCT are associated with high mortality and morbidity. Typical infectious agents are Epstein\u2013Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, varicella\u2010zoster virus and fungi. The study aim was to evaluate whether measurement of the responses of antigen\u2010specific T\u2010cells, recognizing infectious pathogens would correlate to protective functions in the stem cell recipient post\u2010transplant. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty\u2010one grafts were analysed by flow cytometry and cells were stimulated in vitro with relevant infectious antigens, followed by evaluation of T\u2010cell proliferation and cytokine production. Results were compared to the recipients\u2019 clinical records 1\u2010year post\u2010transplantation. RESULTS: We show that an extensive repertoire of transferred antigen\u2010specific T\u2010cells from allogeneic donor grafts against infectious agents, involved in post\u2010transplant infections, are linked to an absence of infectious complications for the recipient up\u2010to 1\u2010year post\u2010transplant. The protective effect was associated with antigen\u2010specific T\u2010cell proliferation and IL\u20101\u03b2 secretion. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that assaying T\u2010cell function before HSCT could determine individual risks for infectious complications and thus aid in clinical decision\u2010making regarding prophylactic and pre\u2010emptive anti\u2010infective therapy.", "OBJECTIVE Relationships between duplex findings and data on health-related quality of life (QoL) to assess long-term results of treatment of varicose veins and chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) are not well known. The goal of this review was to correlate duplex findings and QoL assessments in clinical studies with long-term follow-up. METHODS A review of the English language literature on PUBMED revealed 17 clinical studies, including 9 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 6 prospective, and 2 retrospective studies that included patients with at least 5-year follow-up after endovenous laser ablation (EVLA), radiofrequency ablation (RFA), ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy (UGFS), and traditional superficial venous surgery. RESULTS At 5 years, great saphenous vein (GSV) occlusion rate on duplex ultrasound ranged from 66% to 82% for EVLA, from 62% to 92% for RFA, from 41% to 58% for UGFS and from 54% to 85% for surgery. Freedom from GSV reflux rates were 82% and 84%, respectively for EVLA and surgery, and ranged between 84% and 95% for RFA. Significant improvements were observed in several domains of generic QoL and in most domains of venous disease-specific QoL, irrespective of the treatment. In at least one RCT, CIVIQ scores correlated well with abnormal duplex findings in patients who underwent treatment with UGFS. In another RCT, long-term AVVQ was significantly better after surgery as compared with UGFS similar to results of duplex findings. CONCLUSIONS Analysis of the available literature confirmed that all four techniques were effective in the abolishment of reflux or obliteration of the GSV. Moreover, well-designed RCTs with large sample size are needed to produce robust long-term data on clinical outcome after treatment of varicose veins and CVI and to better understand the relationships between duplex-derived data and QoL assessments.", "PURPOSE To report a combined procedure that opens the acutely thrombosed superior vena cava (SVC) to rapidly alleviate symptoms in seriously ill patients with SVC syndrome. CASE REPORTS Four patients aged 54 to 63 years old with underlying malignancies were referred for treatment of SVC syndrome. All received isolated pharmacomechanical thrombolysis (IPMT) with tissue plasminogen activator delivered in a Trellis Peripheral Infusion System that removed obstructive clot in minutes versus the 24 to 48 hours required for traditional catheter-directed thrombolysis. In each case, stents were inserted immediately following IPMT in a combined procedure lasting <1 hour. Patients exhibited near-immediate relief of debilitating symptoms; completion venography demonstrated patent vessels with excellent blood flow. CONCLUSION Combining IPMT with immediate stenting during the same session is an effective method for managing acute thrombotic SVC syndrome and limiting the exposure time and number of interventions performed on seriously ill patients.", "Current anti-VEGF therapies for colorectal cancer (CRC) provide limited survival benefit, as tumors rapidly develop resistance to these agents. Here, we have uncovered an immunosuppressive role for nonclassical Ly6Clo monocytes that mediates resistance to anti-VEGFR2 treatment. We found that the chemokine CX3CL1 was upregulated in both human and murine tumors following VEGF signaling blockade, resulting in recruitment of CX3CR1+Ly6Clo monocytes into the tumor. We also found that treatment with VEGFA reduced expression of CX3CL1 in endothelial cells in vitro. Intravital microscopy revealed that CX3CR1 is critical for Ly6Clo monocyte transmigration across the endothelium in murine CRC tumors. Moreover, Ly6Clo monocytes recruit Ly6G+ neutrophils via CXCL5 and produce IL-10, which inhibits adaptive immunity. Preventing Ly6Clo monocyte or Ly6G+ neutrophil infiltration into tumors enhanced inhibition of tumor growth with anti-VEGFR2 therapy. Furthermore, a gene therapy using a nanoparticle formulated with an siRNA against CX3CL1 reduced Ly6Clo monocyte recruitment and improved outcome of anti-VEGFR2 therapy in mouse CRCs. Our study unveils an immunosuppressive function of Ly6Clo monocytes that, to our knowledge, has yet to be reported in any context. We also reveal molecular mechanisms underlying antiangiogenic treatment resistance, suggesting potential immunomodulatory strategies to enhance the long-term clinical outcome of anti-VEGF therapies.", " AND PURPOSE The optimal duration of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in acute stroke patients is unknown. This subanalysis of the Extended Prophylaxis for Venous ThromboEmbolism in Acutely Ill Medical Patients With Prolonged Immobilization (EXCLAIM) study investigated extended-duration thromboprophylaxis with enoxaparin, compared with placebo following standard-duration enoxaparin, in ischemic stroke patients. METHODS Acutely ill medical patients with recently reduced mobility received open-label enoxaparin 40 mg for 10\u00b14 days, and they were then randomized to double-blind enoxaparin 40 mg daily or placebo for further 28\u00b14 days. Venous thromboembolism incidence (symptomatic/asymptomatic deep-vein thrombosis, symptomatic/fatal pulmonary embolism) up to day 28 after randomization and major bleeding rates up to 48 h after the last dose of study treatment were reported. RESULTS In total, 389 of 5963 (6.5%) randomized patients had ischemic stroke: 198 received extended-duration prophylaxis and 191 placebo. Extended-duration prophylaxis reduced venous thromboembolism incidence versus placebo (2.4% versus 8.0%; absolute risk difference, -5.6%; 95% CI, -10.5% to -0.7%), but it was associated with an increase in major bleeding (1.5% versus 0% in enoxaparin and placebo groups; absolute risk difference, +1.5%; 95% CI, -0.2% to 3.2%). CONCLUSIONS Extended-duration thromboprophylaxis with enoxaparin was associated with reduced venous thromboembolism risk and increased major bleeding in the subgroup of patients with ischemic stroke in the EXCLAIM study.", "Mood disorders and circulating thyroid antibodies are very prevalent in the population and their concomitant occurrence may be due to chance. However, thyroid antibodies have been repeatedly hypothesized to play a role in specific forms of mood disorders. Potentially related forms include treatment-refractory cases, severe or atypical depression, and depression at specific phases of a woman's life (early gestation, postpartum depression, perimenopausal). With regard to bipolar disorder, studies of specific subgroups (rapid cycling, mixed, or depressive bipolar) have reported associations with thyroid antibodies. Offspring of bipolar subjects were found more vulnerable to develop thyroid antibodies independently from the vulnerability to develop psychiatric disorders. A twin study suggested thyroid antibodies among possible endophenotypes for bipolar disorder. Severe encephalopathies have been reported in association with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Cases with pure psychiatric presentation are being reported, the antithyroid antibodies being probably markers of some other autoimmune disorders affecting the brain. Vasculitis resulting in abnormalities in cortical perfusion is one of the possible mechanisms.", "/AIM Riboflavin (vitamin B2) activated by ultraviolet (UV) light, produces active oxygen which damages cell membrane and prevents replication of the carrier of diseases (viruses, bacteria, protozoa) in all blood products. The aim of this study was to establish the influence of the process of photo inactivation in pathogens using riboflavin and UV rays on the concentration of coagulation factor VIII:C (FVIII:C) and proteins in plasma that were treated before freezing. METHODS The examination included 20 units of plasma, separated from whole blood donated by voluntary blood donors around 6 hours from the moment of collection. The units were pooled and separated in to two groups: one consisted of 10 control units and the other of 10 experimental units. Experimental units of the plasma were treated by riboflavin (35 mL) and UV rays (6.24 J/mL, 265-370 nm) on Mirasol aparature (Caridian BCT Biotechnologies, USA) in approximate duration of 6 minutes. Furthermore, 35 mL of saline solution was added to the control plasma. One sample for examining was taken from the control plasma (KG) and two residual were taken from experimental plasma after the addition of riboflavin either before (EG1) or post illumination (EG2). Results. Comparing the mean values of FVIII:C (%) we noticed statistically significantly higher level in the EG1 group than in the EG2 group (65.00 +/- 4.52 vs. 63.20 +/- 4.73; t = 4.323, p = 0.002), while between the KG and experimental groups (EG1 and EG2) there was no statistically significant difference in the concentration of FVIII:C. There was a statistically significant decrease of albumin concentration (g/L) in the EG2 group comparing to the KG (33.35 +/- 0.94 vs. 31.94 +/- 0.84; t = 3.534, p = 0.002), but there was no mentioned difference in albumin concentration between the KG and the EG1, so as between the EG1 and the EG2. CONCLUSION Plasma inactivated by riboflavin and UV rays (Mirasol PRT system, Caridian BCT, U.S.A.) keeps all the characteristics of conventional plasma, so it could be used for the treatment of pathological conditions that demand transfusion of fresh frozen plasma, or in patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpure when we use therapeutic exchange of plasma.", " Selection of the PEEP associated with the best compliance of the respiratory system during decremental PEEP titration can be used for the treatment of patients suffering from ARDS. We describe changes in transpulmonary pressure (Ptp) and gas exchange during a decremental PEEP titration maneuver in subjects with pulmonary ARDS. METHODS Eleven subjects with early ARDS were included. After a recruitment maneuver they were ventilated in volume-controlled ventilation and PEEP was decreased from 30 to 0 cm H2O by steps of 3 cm H2O. Static airway pressure (Paw), esophageal pressure (Pes), Ptp (Paw - Pes), the ratio of dead space to tidal volume (VD/VT), and PaO2 were recorded at each step. RESULTS A linear correlation was found between Paw and Ptp. Expiratory Ptp became negative in all subjects when PEEP decreased below 8.9 \u00b1 5.2 cm H2O. VD/VT was 0.67 \u00b1 0.06 with 30 cm H2O of PEEP, and decreased 15.4 \u00b1 8.5% during the maneuver, when PEEP and expiratory Ptp were 10.6 \u00b1 4.1 cm H2O and 1.2 \u00b1 2.8 cm H2O, respectively. VD/VT was significantly higher during ventilation at high (> 18 cm H2O), compared to low, inspiratory Ptp values (P < .001). PaO2 decreased when expiratory Ptp became negative (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS During decremental PEEP titration we sequentially observed high inspiratory Ptp that stressed lung tissue and increased VD/VT, and negative Ptp, indicating high risk of alveolar collapse, explaining worse oxygenation. PEEP selection based on Ptp and VD/VT in ARDS may help to avoid these situations.", " AND PURPOSE The surgical approach and repair for urorectal fistula (URF) is a challenging task. A variety of techniques have been described to treat URFs, and the laparoscopic approach has been approved as an efficient tool for even some complex fistulas. We aimed to report our laparoscopic experience for complex URF repair with special emphasis on salvage prostatectomy. PATIENTS AND METHODS The study included four men (59-75 years), with laparoscopic repair for complex URFs. URF developed after transurethral resection of the prostate in patients 2 and 3 and after radical prostatectomy in patient 4. Patient 1 had received combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy for the rectal carcinoma; a prostatic abscess developed that resulted at the end in URF. Laparoscopic salvage prostatectomy was performed for patients 1 and 2. A transvesical laparoscopic approach was performed for patient 3, and a transperitoneal transvesical technique was performed for patient 4. A tunica vaginalis flap was used for patient 1, and peritoneal interposition flaps were developed in patients 2 and 4 mL, and no patients needed intraoperative blood transfusion. Postoperative hospital stay was 12 to 34 days. The urethral catheter was removed on postoperative day 11 to 32, and cystography showed no leakage of contrast except in patient 1. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic URF repair is safe and efficacious in experienced hands even in complex cases, and salvage laparoscopic prostatectomy seems like a valuable operative option. The technique requires advanced experience, however, particularly with pelvic surgery and intracorporeal suturing.", "By collecting photons scattered out of the therapy beam, scatter imaging creates images of the treated volume. Two phantoms were used to assess the possible application of scatter imaging for markerless tracking of lung tumors during stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) treatment. A scatter-imaging camera was assembled with a CsI flat-panel detector and a 5 mm diameter pinhole collimator. Scatter images were collected during the irradiation of phantoms with megavoltage photons. To assess scatter image quality, spherical phantom lung tumors of 2.1 - 2.8 cm diameters were placed inside a static, anthropomorphic phantom. To show the efficacy of the technique with a moving target (3 cm diameter), the position of a simulated tumor was tracked in scatter images during sinusoidal motion (15 mm amplitude, 0.25 Hz frequency) in a dynamic lung phantom in open-field, dynamic conformal arc (DCA), and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) deliveries. Anatomical features are identifiable on static phantom scatter images collected with 10 MU of delivered dose (2.1 cm diameter lung tumor contrast-to-noise ratio of 4.4). The contrast-to-noise ratio increases with tumor size and delivered dose. During dynamic motion, the position of the 3.0 cm diameter lung tumor was identified with a root-mean-square error of 0.8, 1.2, and 2.9 mm for open field (0.3 s frame integration), DCA (0.5 s), and VMAT (0.5 s), respectively. Based on phantom studies, scatter imaging is a potential technique for markerless lung tumor tracking during SBRT without additional imaging dose. Quality scatter images may be collected at low, clinically relevant doses (10 MU). Scatter images are capable of sub-millimeter tracking precision, but modulation decreases accuracy.", "Food waste (FW) is a worldwide environmental issue due to its huge production amount. FW separation from municipal solid waste followed by different treatment strategies has been widely accepted. Food waste disposer (FWD) is a promising approach to separate and collect household food waste (HFW), which has been widely applied in many countries. However, the feasibility of FWD application in many countries is still being debated due to the major concerns over the impact of FWD on the wastewater treatment plants. In order to investigate the feasibility of FWD application, FW characterization is a key work to be conducted in advance. Since the FW characteristics largely vary by region, reliable and representative FW characteristics in different countries should be investigated. To provide such information for further studies on FW management for Hong Kong, HFW was collected from Hong Kong typical households over one year and analyzed systemically in this study. The FW composition varied little from place to place or season to season, and the values observed were comparable with results reported from other countries and regions. Based on the reliable HFW characteristics obtained from one-year survey coupled with statistical analysis, simulated HFW for Hong Kong consisting of 50% fruits, 20% vegetables, 20% starchy food and 10% meat was proposed for future studies. On the other hand, the FWD treatment caused more than 50% of the biodegradable organic content in HFW to dissolve. With a ratio of 1 g food waste to 1 L sewage, total solids in the wastewater stream were predicted to increase by 73%, total chemical oxygen demand by 61%, soluble chemical oxygen demand by 110%, nitrogen by 6% and phosphorus by 16%. Theoretically, 22 million m3/year of additional methane could be generated if 50% of Hong Kong residential buildings equipped with FWD. That would certainly increase pollutant loading on the wastewater treatment plants, but also energy recovery potential.", " The aim of this study was to compare laparoscopic hepaticojejunostomy (LHJ) and open hepaticojejunostomy (OHJ) for choledochal cyst associated with hilar hepatic duct stenosis (HHDS). METHODS Data collection was prospective for LHJ cases from 2009 and retrospective for OHJ cases from 2003 to 2008. Data were compared with respect to HHDS. HHDS was incised longitudinally as required during hilar hepatic ductoplasty. RESULTS Fifty-eight subjects were studied (LHJ: n = 27, 4 boys, 23 girls; OHJ: n = 31; 6 boys, 25 girls). HHDS was present in 10 LHJ cases and 10 OHJ cases. Todani classification of choledochal cyst in LHJ patients was type 1A (n = 16) and type 4A (n = 11), and in OHJ patients, it was type 1A (n = 19) and type 4A (n = 12). There were significant differences between LHJ and OHJ with regard to mean operative time (386 vs 341 min), mean blood loss (5.9 vs 18.4 mL), recommencement of enteral feeding (3.9 vs 6.4 days), and hospital stay (11.7 vs 15.5 days) (all P < 0.05). Hepatic ductoplasty was performed in 23 LHJ patients and in 21 OHJ patients. There were no intraoperative complications and no conversions to OHJ. There were no significant differences between LHJ and OHJ, regardless of the presence of HHDS, for postoperative complications, which included minor bile leakage, anastomotic stricture, and intestinal obstruction. CONCLUSION LHJ is as effective as OHJ for the treatment of choledochal cysts irrespective of the presence of HHDS and the need for hepatic ductoplasty.", "PURPOSE Early in-stent restenosis after stent-protected angioplasty of the carotid artery (SPAC) is an infrequent, but potentially harmful condition for patients with carotid artery disease. METHODS In our retrospective single-center analysis of 176 patients with carotid artery stenting between 2009 and 2015, using duplex ultrasound, we detected 9 patients with high-grade carotid artery in-stent restenosis. All restenosis patients were treated with a drug-eluting balloon (DEB) to prevent recurrent neointimal hyperplasia. One patient had bilateral carotid artery disease with bilateral in-stent restenosis, and 1 patient needed repeated DEB treatment 19 months after the first DEB intervention, so 11 DEB procedures, in total, were performed. RESULTS The median time-interval between primary carotid artery stenting and first DEB-treatment was 9 months. In 3 of the 11 interventions, the DEB treatment was assisted by an additional stent. One repeat DEB treatment was necessary, and three DEB treatments were followed by a secondary stent. No peri-interventional complications (TIA, stroke, or death) were observed during or after DEB intervention. Therefore, in the entire group, the 1y event-free survival (EFS) was 100%, and the 2y/3y/5y EFS was 83%. CONCLUSION DEB intervention seems to be an effective and safe treatment for patients with high-grade in-stent restenosis after SPAC.", "Hip fractures are common orthopedic injuries and are associated with significant morbidity/mortality. Intraoperative normothermia is recommended by national guidelines to minimize additional morbidity/mortality, but limited evidence exists regarding hypothermia's effect on orthopedic patients. The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of intraoperative hypothermia in patients with operatively treated hip fractures and evaluate its effect on complications and outcomes. Retrospective chart review was performed on clinical records from 1541 consecutive patients who sustained a hip fracture and underwent operative fixation at the authors' institution between January 2005 and October 2013. A total of 1525 patients were included for analysis, excluding those with injuries requiring additional surgical intervention. Patient demographic data, surgery-specific data, postoperative complications, length of stay, and 30-day readmission were recorded. Patients with a mean intraoperative temperature less than 36\u00b0C were identified as hypothermic. Statistical analysis with univariate and multivariate logistic regression modeling evaluated associations with hypothermia and effect on complications/outcomes. The incidence of intraoperative hypothermia in operatively treated hip fractures was 17.0%. Hypothermia was associated with an increase in the rate of deep surgical-site infection (odds ratio, 3.30; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-9.14; P=.022). Lower body mass index and increasing age demonstrated increased association with hypothermia (P=.004 and P=.005, respectively). To the authors' knowledge, this is the first and largest study analyzing the effect of intraoperative hypothermia in orthopedic patients. In patients with hip fractures, the study's findings confirm evidence found in other surgical specialties that hypothermia may be associated with an increased risk of deep surgical-site infection and that lower body mass index and increasing age are risk factors for intraoperative hypothermia. [Orthopedics. 2016; 39(6):e1170-e1177.].", " Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism are common after stroke. In small trials of patients undergoing surgery, graduated compression stockings (GCS) reduce the risk of DVT. National stroke guidelines extrapolating from these trials recommend their use in patients with stroke despite insufficient evidence. We assessed the effectiveness of thigh-length GCS to reduce DVT after stroke. METHODS In this outcome-blinded, randomised controlled trial, 2518 patients who were admitted to hospital within 1 week of an acute stroke and who were immobile were enrolled from 64 centres in the UK, Italy, and Australia. Patients were allocated via a central randomisation system to routine care plus thigh-length GCS (n=1256) or to routine care plus avoidance of GCS (n=1262). A technician who was blinded to treatment allocation undertook compression Doppler ultrasound of both legs at about 7-10 days and, when practical, again at 25-30 days after enrolment. The primary outcome was the occurrence of symptomatic or asymptomatic DVT in the popliteal or femoral veins. Analyses were by intention to treat. This study is registered, number ISRCTN28163533. FINDINGS All patients were included in the analyses. The primary outcome occurred in 126 (10.0%) patients allocated to thigh-length GCS and in 133 (10.5%) allocated to avoid GCS, resulting in a non-significant absolute reduction in risk of 0.5% (95% CI -1.9% to 2.9%). Skin breaks, ulcers, blisters, and skin necrosis were significantly more common in patients allocated to GCS than in those allocated to avoid their use (64 [5%] vs 16 [1%]; odds ratio 4.18, 95% CI 2.40-7.27). INTERPRETATION These data do not lend support to the use of thigh-length GCS in patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke. National guidelines for stroke might need to be revised on the basis of these results. FUNDING Medical Research Council (UK), Chief Scientist Office of Scottish Government, Chest Heart and Stroke Scotland, Tyco Healthcare (Covidien) USA, and UK Stroke Research Network.", ": The coronavirus disease (COVID\u201019) pandemic has raised concern of transmission of infectious organisms through aerosols formation in endonasal and transoral surgery. METHODS: Retrospective review. We introduce the negative\u2010pressure otolaryngology viral isolation drape (NOVID) system to reduce the risk of aerosol. NOVID consists of a plastic drape suspended above the patient's head and surgical field with a smoke evacuator suction placed inside the chamber. RESULTS: Four patients underwent endonasal (4) and endo\u2010oral surgery (1). Fluorescein was applied to the surgical field. Black light examination of fluorescein\u2010treated operative fields revealed minimal contamination distant to the surgical field. In two prolonged cases with high\u2010speed drilling, droplets were identified under the barrier and on the tip of the smoke evacuator. Instruments and cottonoids appeared to be a greater contributor to field contamination. CONCLUSIONS: Negative\u2010pressure aspiration of air under a chamber barrier, which appears to successfully keep aerosol and droplet contamination to a minimum.", " The utilization of robotic platforms for general surgery procedures such as hernia repair is growing rapidly in the United States. A limited amount of data are available evaluating operative outcomes in comparison to standard laparoscopic surgery. We completed a retrospective review comparing robotic and laparoscopic ventral hernia repair to provide safety and outcomes data to help design a future prospective trial design. METHODS A retrospective review of 215 patients undergoing ventral hernia repair (142 robotic and 73 laparoscopic) was completed at two large academic centers. Primary outcome measure evaluated was recurrence. Secondary outcomes included incidence of primary fascial closure, and surgical site occurrences. RESULTS Propensity for treatment match comparison demonstrated that robotic repair was associated with a decreased incidence of recurrence (2.1 versus 4.2%, p < 0.001) and surgical site occurrence (4.2 versus 18.8%, p < 0.001). This may be because robotic repair was associated with increased incidence of primary fascial closure (77.1 versus 66.7%, p < 0.01). Analysis of baseline patient populations showed that robotic repairs were completed on patients with lower body mass index (28.1 \u00b1 3.6 versus 34.2 \u00b1 6.4, p < 0.001) and fewer comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS Our retrospective data show that robotic repair was associated with decreased recurrence and surgical site occurrence. However, the differences noted in the patient populations limit the interpretability of these results. As adoption of robotic ventral hernia repair increases, prospective trials need to be designed in order to investigate the efficacy, safety, and cost effectiveness of this evolving technique.", "OBJECTIVE The purpose of the study is to report a multi-institutional experience with robotic-assisted radical hysterectomy to treat patients with early stage cervical cancer with respect to perioperative outcomes. METHODS A multi-institutional robotic surgical consortium consisting of five board-certified gynecologist oncologist in distinct geographical regions of the United States was created to evaluate the utility of robotics for gynecologic surgery (benign and malignant). Between April 2003 and August 2008, a total of 835 patients underwent robotic surgery for benign gynecologic disorders and/or gynecologic malignancies by a surgeon in the consortium. IRB approval was obtained and data was collected in a prospective fashion at each institution. For the purposes of the study, a multi-institutional HIPPA compliant database was then created for all patients that underwent robotic-assisted surgery between the April 2003 and August 2008. This database was queried for all patients who underwent a robotic-assisted type II or III radical hysterectomy for Stage IA1 (+vsi)-IB2 cervical carcinoma. Forty-two patients were identified. Records were then reviewed for demographic data, medical conditions, prior abdominal or pelvic surgeries, and follow-up. The perioperative outcomes analyzed included: operative time (skin-skin), estimated blood loss (EBL), length of hospital stay, total lymph node count, conversion to laparotomy, and operative complications. RESULTS From a database of 835 patients who underwent robotic surgery by a gynecologic oncologist, a total of 42 patients who underwent a robotic-assisted type II (n=10) or type III (n=32) radical hysterectomy for early stage cervical cancer were identified. Demographic data demonstrated a median age of 41 and a median BMI of 25.1. With regard to stage, seven patients (17%) were Stage IA2, twenty-eight patients (67%) were Stage IB1 and six patients (14%) were Stage IB2. There was a single patient with Stage IA1 cervical cancer with vascular space invasion who underwent a type II radical hysterectomy. The overall median operative time was 215 min. The overall median estimated blood loss was 50 cc. No patient received a blood transfusion. The median lymph node count was 25. The median hospital stay was 1 day. Positive lymph nodes were detected in 12% of the patients. Pelvic radiotherapy or chemo-radiation was given to 14% of the patients based on final surgical pathology. Intraoperative complications occurred in 4.8% of the patients and included one conversion to laparotomy (2.4%) and one ureteral injury (2.4%). Postoperative complications were reported in 12% of the patients and included a DVT (2.4%), infection (7.2%), and bladder/urinary tract complication (2.4%) The conversion rate to laparotomy was 2.4%. CONCLUSIONS Robotic-assisted radical hysterectomy is associated with minimal blood loss, a shortened hospital stay, and few operative complications. Operative time and lymph node yields are acceptable. This data suggests that robotic-assisted radical hysterectomy may offer an alternative to traditional radical hysterectomy. This series contributes to the growing literature on robotic-assisted radical hysterectomy and prospective comparisons with traditional radical hysterectomy are needed.", "OBJECTIVES To evaluate the effects of continuous infusion of ropivacaine compared to sham infusion or usual care on pain scores before and after physiotherapy treatment, distance walked and time to discharge from physiotherapy, after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. DESIGN Prospective, randomised, double blind controlled trial. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS Seventy-five participants who underwent CABG surgery with left internal mammary artery grafts were allocated, to the ropivacaine group (n=26), the sham group (n=25), or usual care group (n=24). Participants in the ropivacaine group received 0.5% ropivacaine and participants in the sham group received normal saline, both as continuous infusions via two parasternally tunnelled catheters for 96hours continuously. The usual care group did not receive a device. All groups had patient-controlled analgesia and/or oral analgesia. RESULTS Seventy-two participants completed the study. There was no significant between-group differences in pain scores, distance walked on any post operative day (POD) or number of participants discharged from physiotherapy by POD 4. For the group as a whole there was a significant linear decrease in pain score from mean (SD) 42 (24) mm on POD1 to 15 (16) mm on POD4 (p<0.001), (MD 27mm, 95% CI 22 to 32) and walking distance increased from 1 (5) m on POD1 to 183 (239) m on POD4 (p<0.001) MD 181m, 95% CI 126 to 236). CONCLUSION Infusion of ropivacaine post CABG surgery was unable to reduce pain, increase distance walked or reduce time to physiotherapy discharge compared to sham or usual care. Trial registration number ACTRN12612001243808.", " The aim of this study was to demonstrate a new, easy and safe technique, which has not been defined in the literature previously, that enables the gradual primary closure of fasciotomy wounds using barbed sutures. METHODS The technique was performed on five patients who presented with fasciotomy wounds on both upper and lower extremities, varying in size, observed after compartment syndrome due to different causes. The average width of the defects for which primary closure was planned was 8.8 cm. Following the fasciotomy incision, absorbable barbed sutures were inserted through the dermal tissue around the wound similar to that of a subcuticular closure, but left loose, after which closed dressing was applied. During the clinical follow-up, with the decrease in tissue edema and tightness around the wound, the barbed suture was tightened at bedside every 48-72 hours. RESULTS At the end of this gradual closure, all the fasciotomy defects were primarily closed within an average of 8.6 days. All the patients had complete and uncomplicated primary closure with the exception of one with high-voltage electrical burn injury, who developed necrosis in the distal part of the defect, and was treated by secondary healing. CONCLUSION The gradual fasciotomy closure technique with barbed suture seems to be an easy, rapid and effective method.", "PURPOSE The purpose of this study was to sequentially investigate the biomechanical effects of anterosuperior rotator cuff tear size on superior and anterosuperior translation, including tears interrupting the anterior cable attachment and the anterior force couple. METHODS Five cadaveric shoulders were subjected to different loading conditions in both the superior and anterosuperior directions in the intact state, with the supraspinatus cut and with sequentially larger anterosuperior rotator cuff tears. RESULTS Isolated tears of the supraspinatus had no significant biomechanical consequences under any condition tested. Anterosuperior translation was greater than superior translation in the intact specimen and for every combination of anterosuperior rotator cuff defect. With the supraspinatus and the superior half of the subscapularis (i.e., the anterior cable attachment) released, there was no significant increase in anterosuperior or superior glenohumeral translation in response to lower loading conditions (10 to 20 N). At higher loading conditions (40 to 50 N), tears of the supraspinatus and superior half of the subscapularis led to significantly increased translation in both directions. CONCLUSIONS Simulated anterosuperior rotator cuff tears involving the superior half of the subscapularis significantly alter shoulder biomechanics and lead to increased anterosuperior and superior glenohumeral translation under higher loads. The anterior attachment of the rotator cuff cable is therefore an important determinant of the biomechanics of anterosuperior rotator cuff tears at higher loads but not at lower loads. Preserving the inferior half of the subscapularis was sufficient to maintain relatively normal shoulder kinematics under lower loading conditions. Tears of the entire subscapularis altered glenohumeral kinematics at essentially all loads. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Knowledge of the biomechanics of anterosuperior rotator cuff tears enhances our understanding of how to best treat these lesions.", "RATIONALE Corticosteroid therapy is commonly used among critically ill patients with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), but its impact on outcomes is uncertain. Analyses of observational studies often do not account for patients' clinical condition at the time of corticosteroid therapy initiation. OBJECTIVES To investigate the association of corticosteroid therapy on mortality and on MERS coronavirus RNA clearance in critically ill patients with MERS. METHODS ICU patients with MERs were included from 14 Saudi Arabian centers between September 2012 and October 2015. We performed marginal structural modeling to account for baseline and time-varying confounders. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Of 309 patients, 151 received corticosteroids. Corticosteroids were initiated at a median of 3.0 days (quartile 1 [Q1]-Q3, 1.0-7.0) from ICU admission. Patients who received corticosteroids were more likely to receive invasive ventilation (141 of 151 [93.4%] vs. 121 of 158 [76.6%]; P < 0.0001) and had higher 90-day crude mortality (112 of 151 [74.2%] vs. 91 of 158 [57.6%]; P = 0.002). Using marginal structural modeling, corticosteroid therapy was not significantly associated with 90-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio, 0.75; 95% confidence interval, 0.52-1.07; P = 0.12) but was associated with delay in MERS coronavirus RNA clearance (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.17-0.72; P = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS Corticosteroid therapy in patients with MERS was not associated with a difference in mortality after adjustment for time-varying confounders but was associated with delayed MERS coronavirus RNA clearance. These findings highlight the challenges and importance of adjusting for baseline and time-varying confounders when estimating clinical effects of treatments using observational studies.", "Background. Kawasaki disease is characterized by systemic vasculitis of unknown etiology. Previous genetic studies have identified certain candidate genes associated with susceptibility to KD and coronary artery lesions. Host innate immune response factors are involved in modulating the disease outcome. The aim of this study was to investigate CLEC5A (C-type lectin domain family 5) genetic polymorphisms with regards to the susceptibility and outcome of KD. Methods. A total of 1045 subjects (381 KD patients and 664 controls) were enrolled to identify 4 tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (tSNPs) of CLEC5A (rs1285968, rs11770855, rs1285935, rs1285933) by using the TaqMan Allelic Discrimination Assay. The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was assessed in cases and controls, and genetic effects were evaluated by the chi-square test. Results. No significant associations were noted between the genotypes and allele frequency of the 4 CLEC5A tSNPs between controls and patients. In the patients, polymorphisms of CLEC5A showed no significant association with coronary artery lesion formation and intravenous immunoglobulin treatment response. Conclusions. This study showed for the first time that polymorphisms of CLEC5A are not associated with susceptibility to KD, coronary artery lesion formation, and intravenous immunoglobulin treatment response in a Taiwanese population.", " A delta-shaped anastomosis in totally laparoscopic Billroth I gastrectomy could be performed easily and sufficiently using only laparoscopic linear staplers. However, the restricted maneuverability and severe blurring of these staplers along with their limited hemostability induced strain. In this study, we determined the feasibility and safety of performing delta-shaped anastomosis using the Endo GIA\u2122 Reloads with Tri-Staple\u2122 Technology combined with Endo GIA\u2122 Ultra Universal stapler (Tri-Staple) with a particular focus on short-term surgical outcomes. METHODS We performed a single-institutional prospective interventional study (UMIN 000008014). The Tri-Staple was prospectively used on 23 consecutive patients who underwent a curative totally laparoscopic Billroth I gastrectomy with delta-shaped anastomosis. These patients were matched with the 19 patients previously treated using the ENDOPATH(\u00ae) ETS Articulating Linear Cutters (ETS) on clinical and demographic characteristics. RESULTS There were no differences between the groups in anastomosis-related local complications, morbidity, non-anastomosis-related local complications, total systemic complications, and short-term outcomes with the exception of significantly reduced blood loss in the Tri-Staple group (ETS vs. Tri-Staple: 37 [10-306] vs. 15 [5-210] mL, p = 0.02). Intraoperative bleeding from the staple line was significantly reduced in the Tri-Staple group. The postoperative drain indwelling period (ETS vs. Tri-Staple, 6 [4-10] vs. 4 [2-43] days, p = 0.032), fasting period (5 [3-7] vs. 3 [3-24] days, p = 0.022), and hospital stay (14 [10-47] vs. 11 [6-58] days, p = 0.025) were significantly shorter in the Tri-Staple group. There was no mortality in this series. Acceleration assessed as indices of blurring of stapler tip might have a significant adverse influence on staple-line bleeding at stapling sites. CONCLUSION Totally laparoscopic Billroth I distal gastrectomy using Tri-Staple was feasible and safe with favorable short-term surgical outcomes. Reduced blurring while stapling may be a novel endpoint which newly developed stapling devices should target.", " AND PURPOSE The Low-Profile Visualized Intraluminal Support (LVIS) stent is a new device recently introduced for the treatment of wide-neck intracranial aneurysms. This single-center study presents the authors' preliminary experience using the LVIS stent to treat saccular aneurysms with parent arteries smaller than 2.5 mm. MATERIALS AND METHODS Aneurysms with a LVIS stent used in a small parent vessel (<2.5 mm in diameter) between October 2014 and April 2016 were included. Procedure-related complications, angiographic results, clinical outcomes, and midterm follow-up data were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS A total of 22 patients was studied, including 5 ruptured and 17 unruptured aneurysms. Most of the aneurysms were located in the anterior circulation (90.9%). Stent placement in the parent arteries measuring 1.7-2.4 mm in diameter (mean, 2.1 mm) was successful in 100% of cases. Procedure-related complication developed in 1 patient (4.5%) who presented with aneurysm rupture. No permanent morbidity and mortality occurred. Immediate angiographic outcome showed complete occlusion in 8 aneurysms (36.4%), neck residual in 8 (36.4%), and residual aneurysm in 6 (27.3%). All patients underwent angiographic follow-up at a mean of 8.3 months, which revealed complete occlusion in 18 (81.8%) patients, neck remnant in 3 (13.6%), and residual sac in 1 (4.5%). No recanalization of the target aneurysm was observed. There was 1 case with asymptomatic in-stent stenosis. CONCLUSIONS Our preliminary results show that the deployment of LVIS stents in small vessels is feasible, safe, and effective in the midterm. Larger studies with long-term follow-up are needed to validate our promising results.", "Pulmonary hemorrhage is a potentially serious complication of radiofrequency ablation of pulmonary neoplasms that may occur with or without hemoptysis. Several factors influence the development of parenchymal hemorrhage, including tumor size, tumor location, and procedural technique. As radiofrequency ablation has become more common, the prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment of hemorrhage is vital. The authors report a case of radiofrequency ablation of a solitary pulmonary metastasis complicated by pulmonary hemorrhage and hemoptysis.", "The authors report a case of a 21-year-old woman taking oral contraceptives for severe dysmenorrhea who presented with a hepatic mass and worsening right upper quadrant pain. The oral contraceptives could not be discontinued because of her pelvic symptoms, necessitating treatment of the liver lesion for symptomatic relief. Computed tomography and percutaneous biopsy demonstrated the mass to be focal nodular hyperplasia. The patient opted for radiofrequency ablation rather than surgical enucleation for symptomatic relief. The ablation proved to be a safe and effective alternative to surgery to treat the benign tumor, and permitted more aggressive therapy of the dysmenorrhea.", "AIMS EA-230 is a human chorionic gonadotropin hormone-derived linear tetrapeptide, developed for the treatment of systemic inflammation-related disorders. EA-230 has shown promising immunomodulatory and tissue-protective effects in animals and an excellent safety profile in human phase I studies that we performed. The present phase IIa study follows-up on these results by investigating the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of EA-230 under systemic inflammatory conditions induced by experimental human endotoxaemia. METHODS In this randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled phase IIa study, systemic inflammation was induced by intravenous administration of Escherichia coli-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS). At t = 0 hours, 36 healthy male volunteers received 2 ng/kg LPS, followed by a 2-hour continuous infusion of EA-230 (15, 45 and 90 mg/kg/h, n = 8 per group) or placebo (n = 12). RESULTS EA-230 was well tolerated and showed a favourable safety profile. Treatment with the highest dose of EA-230 resulted in a significant attenuation of the LPS-induced increase in plasma levels of inflammatory mediators interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-1 receptor antagonist, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, macrophage inflammatory proteins-1\u03b1 and -1\u03b2, and vascular cell adhesion protein-1 (% reduction of 48, 28, 33, 28, 14, 16 and 19 respectively, p < .01), and reduced fever (peak decrease from 1.8 \u00b1 0.1\u00b0C to 1.3 \u00b1 0.2\u00b0C, P < .05) and symptom scores (peak decrease from 7.4 \u00b1 1.0 to 4.0 \u00b1 1.2 points, P < .05). EA-230 exhibited a very short elimination half-life and a large volume of distribution in the highest dosage group (geometric mean and 95% confidence interval: 0.17 [0.12-0.24] hours and 2.2 [1.3-3.8] L/kg, respectively). CONCLUSION Administration of EA-230 is safe and results in attenuation of the systemic inflammatory response in humans.", "The care of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic has added many layers of complexity to ethical issues. Our response emphasizes the importance of having an ethically sound framework to inform our decisions, requiring caregivers to consider what is ethically optimal and feasible for the patient. It is increasingly important to understand the ethical principles and to appropriately apply them to both patient management decisions and guide scarce resource allocation. If we are to be prepared to face the many challenges of this pandemic, we must prioritize the ethical demands to our treatment and management concerns.", " To ensure the safety and efficacy of the increasing number of transvenous lead extractions (TLEs), it is necessary to adequately assess the procedure-related risk. METHODS We analyzed potential clinical and procedural risk factors associated with 2049 TLE procedures. The TLEs were performed between 2006 and 2016 using only simple tools for lead extraction. Logistic regression analysis was used to develop a risk prediction scoring system for TLEs. RESULTS Multivariate analysis showed that the sum of lead dwell times, anemia, female gender, the number of procedures preceding TLE, and removal of leads implanted in patients under the age of 30 had a significant influence on the occurrence of major complications during a TLE. This information served as a basis for developing a predictive SAFeTY TLE score, where: S = sum of lead dwell times, A = anemia, Fe = female, T = treatment (previous procedures), Y = young patients, and TLE = transvenous lead extraction. In order to facilitate the use of the SAFeTY TLE Score, a simple calculator was constructed. CONCLUSION The SAFeTY TLE score is easy to calculate and predicts the potential occurrence of procedure-related major complications. High-risk patients (scoring more than 10 on the SAFeTY TLE scale) must be treated at high-volume centers with surgical backup.", " Minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) is accepted for resection of early esophageal cancers. The optimal surgical approach for more advanced disease is unknown. An evaluation of MIE in patients with advanced tumors having undergone neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) is presented. METHODS A retrospective review of patients with esophageal cancer who underwent MIE from November 2006 to November 2011 was performed RESULTS In total, 96 consecutive patients underwent MIE for malignancy. Median age was 65 years (range 26 to 88), and 86% were male. Adenocarcinoma represented 87% of patients. Eighty-three percent of patients were staged IIa or higher and 62 (65%) patients received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Four (6%) patients additionally received intraoperative electron beam radiotherapy. Twenty-six (27%) patients received postoperative adjuvant therapy with 22 (85%) of these having also received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. All cases were completed thoraco-laparoscopically except for 2 conversions to mini-laparotomy. Twelve (12%) cervical anastomoses and 84 (88%) thoracic anastomoses were performed. Median operative time was 326 minutes (range 193 to 567) and did not differ significantly between those with and without nCRT. Complete pathologic response was seen in 21 (34%) of the 62 patients receiving neoadjuvant treatment. Major and minor morbidities were experienced in 28% and 38.5% of patients. There were 2 (2%) in-hospital mortalities; 1 each having received or not received neoadjuvant therapy. At median follow-up 24 months (range 3 to 70 months), overall survival was 58% and 55 (57%) patients were alive without recurrence. CONCLUSIONS Minimally invasive esophagectomy is an acceptable surgical therapy for advanced-stage esophageal malignancies after nCRT without evidence for increased morbidity or mortality.", " Aneurysm recanalization remains a limitation of endovascular treatment. A new type of bioactive coil, the polyglycolic/polylactic acid-covered platinum microfilaments Nexus coil (ev3/Covidien, Irvine, CA, USA), has been proposed. The objective is to evaluate the safety and short-term and mid-term efficacy of Nexus coils in the endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms. METHODS The ENDECOR (European Nexus Detachable Coil Registry) is the first prospective, consecutive, multicenter non-randomized registry. After providing informed consent, 390 patients (238 women and 152 men; mean age, 51.6 years) with 404 ruptured or unruptured aneurysms were enrolled at 34 centers. Treatment was performed with at least 75 % of coil length as Nexus coils. Clinical and technical complications were systematically reported. An independent core laboratory evaluated angiographic results by using the Raymond Grading Scale. RESULTS Complete occlusion was seen in 181 aneurysms (48 %); neck remnant in 86 aneurysms (22 %) and aneurysm remnant in 111 aneurysms (30 %). Technical and clinical complications related to the procedure occurred in 33 patients (8.5 %). At discharge, overall mortality and permanent-morbidity were 4.1 % (16/390) and 5.6 % (14/251), respectively. Angiographic mean follow-up of 13.3 months was obtained in 233 of 390 patients (64.4 %) harboring 247 aneurysms. Recanalization was observed in 44 aneurysms (17.7 %), and progressive thrombosis was observed in 53 aneurysms (21.6 %). CONCLUSIONS Endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms with Nexus coils was associated with low morbidity and mortality rates. Efficacy of Nexus coils was comparable to published series of intracranial aneurysms treated with bare platinum coils, but their efficacy to prevent aneurysm recanalization was not demonstrated.", "OBJECTIVE To assess the long-term outcome of computed tomography-guided radiofrequency ablation (CT-guided RFA) in patients with suspected osteoid osteoma (OO). MATERIALS AND METHODS Single-center retrospective study. Patients with clinical suspicion and imaging diagnosis of osteoid osteoma were treated by CT-guided RFA using the same device with either a 7- or 10-mm active tip electrode. Specific precautions were applied in case of articular or spinal OO. Patients were contacted by phone to evaluate the long-term outcome in terms of pain, ability to perform daily activities (including sports), and long-term complications. Success was defined as the absence of residual pain and ability to perform daily activities normally. RESULTS From 2008 to 2015, 126 patients were treated by CT-guided RFA for OO in our institution. Mean patient age was 26.1 years (SD = 11, range 1-53); mean delay to diagnosis was 16.9 months (SD = 15.2, range 1-120). Among patients who answered the follow-up call (n = 88), the overall success rate was 94.3%: 79/88 (89.8%) had primary success of the procedure, and 4/88 (4.5%) had a secondary success (repeat-RFA after pain recurrence). Mean follow-up time was 34.6 months (SD = 24.7, range 3-90). Few complications occurred: two mild reversible peripheral nerve injuries, one brachial plexus neuropathy, one broken electrode tip fragment, and one muscular hematoma. CONCLUSION Osteoid osteoma can be effectively and safely treated by CT-guided RFA using the presented ablation protocol. Beneficial effects of the treatment persist at long-term follow-up.", "Severe community-acquired pneumonia necessitating intensive care unit admission is associated with high morbidity, mortality, and health-care cost. This review article serves to summarize the epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of this common life-threatening condition. Current practice guidelines as well as the role of several scoring systems (such as the PSI, CURB-65, and IDSA/ATS criteria) used to predict CAP severity, prognosis, and site of care are reviewed. In addition, common complications and prevention strategies are discussed.", "Pharmacomechanical Thrombectomy (PMT) is recognized as a recent advancement in the treatment of lower extremity deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Evidence for the use of this modality is growing rapidly, primarily based on anecdotal experience and large case series. Currently, the majority of patients with lower extremity DVT are treated with anticoagulation or compressive therapy without adjunctive surgical or interventional procedures. This article reviews the current evidence supporting the use of PMT over catheter directed thrombolysis or simple anticoagulation and the expected benefits that can be realized from each modality. In addition the relevant unique characteristics to each device currently available are described focusing on mechanism of action and potential side effects.", "Medications to treat major depressive disorder (MDD) are not equally effective across patients. Given that neural response to rewards is altered in MDD and given that reward-related circuitry is modulated by dopamine and serotonin, we examined, for the first time, whether reward-related neural activity moderated response to sertraline, an antidepressant medication that targets these neurotransmitters. A total of 222 unmedicated adults with MDD randomized to receive sertraline (n = 110) or placebo (n = 112) in the Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response in Clinical Care (EMBARC) study completed demographic and clinical assessments, and pretreatment functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing a reward task. We tested whether an index of reward system function in the ventral striatum (VS), a key reward circuitry region, moderated differential response to sertraline versus placebo, assessed with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HSRD) over 8 weeks. We observed a significant moderation effect of the reward index, reflecting the temporal dynamics of VS activity, on week-8 depression levels (Fs \u2265 9.67, ps \u2264 0.002). Specifically, VS responses that were abnormal with respect to predictions from reinforcement learning theory were associated with lower week-8 depression symptoms in the sertraline versus placebo arms. Thus, a more abnormal pattern of pretreatment VS dynamic response to reward expectancy (expected outcome value) and prediction error (difference between expected and actual outcome), likely reflecting serotonergic and dopaminergic deficits, was associated with better response to sertraline than placebo. Pretreatment measures of reward-related VS activity may serve as objective neural markers to advance efforts to personalize interventions by guiding individual-level choice of antidepressant treatment.", "We describe a new emergency interventional radiology approach in percutaneous procedure complications. We present the case of an 81-year-old male with small renal cancer, approached with percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RTA) and complicated by pseudoaneurysm bleeding of a renal artery branch. In the emergency setting, pseudoaneurysm was treated in the CT room by the same RTA needle, without any complications or local tumor recurrence during the next 6-month follow-up.", " Neuroendocrine tumors are well vascularized and express specific cell surface markers, such as somatostatin receptors and the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R). Using the Rip1Tag2 transgenic mouse model of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNET), we have investigated the potential benefit of a combination of anti-angiogenic treatment with targeted internal radiotherapy. METHODS [Lys40(Ahx-DTPA-111In)NH2]-exendin-4, a radiopeptide that selectively binds to GLP-1R expressed on insulinoma and other neuroendocrine tumor cells, was co-administered with oral vatalanib (an inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR)) or imatinib (a c-kit/PDGFR inhibitor). The control groups included single-agent kinase inhibitor treatments and [Lys40(Ahx-DTPA-natIn)NH2]-exendin-4 monotherapy. For biodistribution, Rip1Tag2 mice were pre-treated with oral vatalanib or imatinib for 0, 3, 5, or 7 days at a dose of 100 mg/kg. Subsequently, [Lys40(Ahx-DTPA-111In)NH2]-exendin-4 was administered i.v., and the biodistribution was assessed after 4 h. For therapy, the mice were injected with 1.1 MBq [Lys40(Ahx-DTPA-111In)NH2]-exendin-4 and treated with vatalanib or imatinib 100 mg/kg orally for another 7 days. Tumor volume, tumor cell apoptosis and proliferation, and microvessel density were quantified. RESULTS Combination of [Lys40(Ahx-DTPA-111In)NH2]-exendin-4 and vatalanib was significantly more effective than single treatments (p < 0.05) and reduced the tumor volume by 97% in the absence of organ damage. The pre-treatment of mice with vatalanib led to a reduction in the tumor uptake of [Lys40(Ahx-DTPA-111In)NH2]-exendin-4, indicating that concomitant administration of vatalanib and the radiopeptide was the best approach. Imatinib did not show a synergistic effect with [Lys40(Ahx-DTPA-111In)NH2]-exendin-4. CONCLUSION The combination of 1.1 MBq of [Lys40(Ahx-DTPA-111In)NH2]-exendin-4 with 100 mg/kg vatalanib had the same effect on a neuroendocrine tumor as the injection of 28 MBq of the radiopeptide alone but without any apparent side effects, such as radiation damage of the kidneys.", "Background The selection of a pre-shaped microcatheter or a shaping method must be carefully considered for successful aneurysm coiling. The objective of this report is to verify the use of intravascular placement to establish an appropriate microcatheter shape. Methods Fifteen patients (15 aneurysms) were included in this study because of the predicted difficulty of microcatheter insertion and stabilisation. The SL-10 straight microcatheter was inserted into the parent artery until the tip of the catheter passed through the neck of the aneurysm. After 5 minutes, the microcatheter was pulled out and the shape acquired from intravascular placement was confirmed and compared with the three-dimensional rotational angiography. In addition, the microcatheter tip was steam-shaped for coiling and coil embolisation was performed. A silicone flow model was also used to confirm our findings. The first experiment compared the bend angle in four different microcatheters placed in the model for 5 minutes. In the second experiment, the SL-10 straight microcatheter was placed in the model, and the bend angle was measured at 2.5, 5, 7.5 and 10 minutes to observe the changes in bend angle over time. Results The SL-10 straight microcatheter, in place for 5 minutes, acquired a shape similar to the patient's own vessel. Among the 15 patients included, 13 were treated using an intravascular shaped microcatheter. In the flow model experiments, the SL-10 most easily acquired the vessel shape, and the shape change stabilised after 5 minutes. Conclusion Shaping the SL-10 straight microcatheter using intravascular placement is an effective shaping method for aneurysm coil embolisation.", " Persistent primitive hypoglossal artery (PPHA), a remnant of embryonal circulation, is a rare variant of the posterior cerebral circulation. Seven prior cases of posterior circulation stroke in the setting of PPHA have been described in the literature, with all but one case being attributable to atherosclerotic embolization from the internal carotid artery (ICA) through the PPHA. CASE DESCRIPTION We report a unique case of a young male with a PPHA presenting with a \"top of the basilar\" syndrome following the repair of his atrial septal defect who underwent emergent revascularization via endovascular mechanical aspiration thrombectomy. The patient underwent a successful aspiration thrombectomy with significant improvement in his clinical exam. CONCLUSIONS Considering the rarity of this persistent fetal anastamosis, it is important to be aware of the propensity for unusual presentations in the context of stroke, understand the management of the problem, and expeditiously treat the patient.", "PURPOSE OF REVIEW Portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG) and gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE) are two types of upper gastrointestinal bleeding that may present similarly, but are managed very differently. This article reviews the pathogenesis and guidelines in management of both of these conditions with emphasis on recent advances in the field. RECENT FINDINGS Off-label use of Hemospray has been shown in several case series to be useful in managing acute bleeding from PHG. Balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration presents an alternative approach for this condition. Radiofrequency ablation may be an alternative therapy to argon plasma coagulation in the endoscopic treatment of GAVE, as it consists of fewer sessions and has been shown to decrease gastrointestinal blood loss. SUMMARY The treatment options for PHG and GAVE are constantly evolving and expanding. In this review, we present the latest approaches in the gastroenterologist's arsenal to deal with these conditions.", "Human coronavirus 229E, classified as a group I coronavirus, utilizes human aminopeptidase N (APN) as a receptor; however, its entry mechanism has not yet been fully elucidated. We found that HeLa cells infected with 229E via APN formed syncytia when treated with trypsin or other proteases but not in a low-pH environment, a finding consistent with syncytium formation by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). In addition, trypsin induced cleavage of the 229E S protein. By using infectious viruses and pseudotyped viruses bearing the 229E S protein, we found that its infection was profoundly blocked by lysosomotropic agents as well as by protease inhibitors that also prevented infection with SARS-CoV but not that caused by murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus strain JHMV, which enters cells directly from the cell surface. We found that cathepsin L (CPL) inhibitors blocked 229E infection the most remarkably among a variety of protease inhibitors tested. Furthermore, 229E infection was inhibited in CPL knockdown cells by small interfering RNA, compared with what was seen for a normal counterpart producing CPL. However, its inhibition was not so remarkable as that found with SARS-CoV infection, which seems to indicate that while CPL is involved in the fusogenic activation of 229E S protein in endosomal infection, not-yet-identified proteases could also play a part in that activity. We also found 229E virion S protein to be cleaved by CPL. Furthermore, as with SARS-CoV, 229E entered cells directly from the cell surface when cell-attached viruses were treated with trypsin. These findings suggest that 229E takes an endosomal pathway for cell entry and that proteases like CPL are involved in this mode of entry.", "Human enterovirus 68 (EVD68) is a primary causative agent for respiratory illness worldwide. Until now, there has been no available medication for treating EVD68-related diseases. Rheum emodin, artemisinin, astragaloside, pseudolaric acid B, oridonin, and erianin are natural extracts from Chinese herbs that have traditionally been used for the treatment and prevention of epidemic diseases. Our results showed that pseudolaric acid B protected cells from EVD68-induced cytopathic effects and decreased viral production. However, the same effects were not observed with rheum emodin, astragaloside, or artemisinin. Pseudolaric acid B inhibited EVD68 production by manipulating the host cell cycle in G2/M phase. Further, either oridonin or erianin related G2/M arrest also inhibited viral production. Due to inducing G2/M phase arrest, pseudolaric acid B, oridonin, and erianin might be good candidates for inhibiting EVD68 production, and Chinese herbs with natural compounds inducing G2/M arrest should be considered for the treatment of EVD68-related diseases.", "The coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) is developing rapidly and posing great threat to public health. There is no specific medicine available for treating the disease. Luckily, traditional Chinese medicine has played a positive role in the fighting against COVID-19. In this paper, We collected and sorted the prescriptions of modern Chinese medicine for COVID-19 released by national government, different provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities, as well as online databases, such as CNKI, WanFang medical network, and VIP database. These prescriptions were combined with the inheritance of traditional Chinese medicine auxiliary V2.5, and the complex system entropy clustering method was used to determine the association rules and frequency of single drug and drug combination in the prescription. In the end, 96 effective prescriptions were included. Among them, the four properties were mainly concentrated in temperature, cold and level, the five tastes were mainly concentrated in bitter, hot and sweet, and the meridians were mainly concentrated in lung, stomach and spleen. The high-frequency drugs were Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma, Armeniacae Semen Amarum, Gypsum Fibrosum, etc., and the high-frequency combinations are Gypsum Fibrosum-Armeniacae Semen Amarum, Gypsum Fibrosum-Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma, Armeniacae Semen Amarum-Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma, the core combinations are Lepidii Semen-Armeniacae Semen Amarum-Gypsum Fibrosum, Pogostemonis Herba-Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens-Magnoliae Officinalis Cortex, Ophiopogonis Radix-Armeniacae Semen Amarum-Scutellariae Radix and so on. Form new prescriptions Lepidii Semen, Armeniacae Semen Amarum, Gypsum Fibrosum, Pogostemonis Herba, Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens, Magnoliae Officinalis Cortex. Ophiopogonis Radix, Armeniacae Semen Amarum, Scutellariae Radix, Schisandrae Sphenantherae Fructus, Panacis Quinquefolii Radix. From the medicinal properties to high-frequency drugs and new prescriptions, it could be seen that the overall treatment of COVID-19 by traditional Chinese medicine was to strengthen body resistance, eliminate pathogenic factors, and give attention to Qi and Yin.", "Cerebral aneurysms are pathological focal evaginations of the arterial wall at and around the junctions of the circle of Willis. Their tenuous walls predispose aneurysms to leak or rupture leading to hemorrhagic strokes with high morbidity and mortality rates. The endovascular treatment of cerebral aneurysms currently includes the implantation of fine-mesh stents, called flow diverters, within the parent artery bearing the aneurysm. By mitigating flow velocities within the aneurysmal sac, the devices preferentially induce thrombus formation in the aneurysm within hours to days. In response to the foreign implant, an endothelialized arterial layer covers the luminal surface of the device over a period of days to months. Organization of the intraneurysmal thrombus leads to resorption and shrinkage of the aneurysm wall and contents, eventually leading to beneficial remodeling of the pathological site to a near-physiological state. The devices' primary function of reducing flow activity within aneurysms is corollary to their mesh structure. Complete specification of the device mesh structure, or alternately device permeability, necessarily involves the quantification of two variables commonly used to characterize porous media-mesh porosity and mesh pore density. We evaluated the flow alteration induced by five commercial neurovascular devices of varying porosity and pore density (stents: Neuroform, Enterprise, and LVIS; flow diverters: Pipeline and FRED) in an idealized sidewall aneurysm model. As can be expected in such a model, all devices substantially reduced intraneurysmal kinetic energy as compared to the nonstented case with the coarse-mesh stents inducing a 65-80% reduction whereas the fine-mesh flow diverters induced a near-complete flow stagnation (\u223c98% reduction). We also note a trend toward greater device efficacy (lower intraneurysmal flow) with decreasing device porosity and increasing device pore density. Several such flow studies have been and are being conducted in idealized as well as patient-derived geometries with the overarching goals of improving device design, facilitating treatment planning (what is the optimal device for a specific aneurysm), and predicting treatment outcome (will a specific aneurysm treated with a specific device successfully occlude over the long term). While the results are generally encouraging, there is poor standardization of study variables between different research groups, and any consensus will only be reached after standardized studies are conducted on collectively large datasets. Biochemical variables may have to be incorporated into these studies to maximize predictive values.", ": Shared decision making (SDM) is a key attribute of patient-centered care, which empowers palliative care patients to be able to make optimal medical decisions about end-of-life treatments based on their own values and preferences. AIM: The aim of this systematic literature review is to detail and compare interventions supporting SDM over the last 10 years (January 2008 to December 2017) and to analyze patient/caregiver outcomes at the end of life. METHODS: This review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, and Cochrane Library were searched with key search terms: SDM, decision aid, decision support, palliative care, and hospice care. The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool was used to assess the quality of the included studies. RESULTS: The initial search yielded 2705 articles, and 12 studies were included in the final review. The quality of the studies was modest and technology-enabled delivery modes (e.g., video, DVD, web-based tool) were most commonly used. Patient/caregiver knowledge of end-of-life care was the most common primary outcome across studies. The strength of the association between the SDM interventions and patient/caregiver outcomes varied. CONCLUSION: The findings from the studies that examined the effects of the SDM intervention on patient outcomes were inconsistent, highlighting the need for further SDM intervention studies among diverse patient populations using consistent measures. Given the availability of health technologies, future studies should focus on developing individual-tailored, technology-enabled interventions to support patient-centered medical decision making.", "OBJECTIVES The purpose of our study was to distinguish the different components of a brain arteriovenous malformation (bAVM) on 3D rotational angiography (3D-RA) using a semi-automated segmentation algorithm. MATERIALS AND METHODS Data from 3D-RA of 15 patients (8 males, 7 females; 14 supratentorial bAVMs, 1 infratentorial) were used to test the algorithm. Segmentation was performed in two steps: (1) nidus segmentation from propagation (vertical then horizontal) of tagging on the reference slice (i.e., the slice on which the nidus had the biggest surface); (2) contiguity propagation (based on density and variance) from tagging of arteries and veins distant from the nidus. Segmentation quality was evaluated by comparison with six frame/s DSA by two independent reviewers. Analysis of supraselective microcatheterisation was performed to dispel discrepancy. RESULTS Mean duration for bAVM segmentation was 64 \u00b1 26 min. Quality of segmentation was evaluated as good or fair in 93% of cases. Segmentation had better results than six frame/s DSA for the depiction of a focal ectasia on the main draining vein and for the evaluation of the venous drainage pattern. CONCLUSION This segmentation algorithm is a promising tool that may help improve the understanding of bAVM angio-architecture, especially the venous drainage. KEY POINTS \u2022 The segmentation algorithm allows for the distinction of the AVM's components \u2022 This algorithm helps to see the venous drainage of bAVMs more precisely \u2022 This algorithm may help to reduce the treatment-related complication rate.", "OBJECTIVE The present study aimed to evaluate the short-term clinical performance and safety of percutaneous microwave ablation (MWA) techniques for the treatment of bone tumors. METHODS This single-institution retrospective study investigated 47 cases of bone tumors treated by MWA from June 2015 to June 2018. The study included 26 patients (55.3%) with benign bone tumors and 21 patients (44.7%) with malignant bone tumors. The tumors were located in the spine or sacrum (15, 31.9%), the upper extremities (6, 12.8%), the lower extremities (17, 36.2%) and the pelvis (9, 19.1%). Outcomes regarding clinical efficacy, including pain relief, quality of life, and intervention-related complications, were evaluated before and after MWA using the visual analog scale (VAS) and the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) scoring system. RESULTS Of the 47 patients included in this study, all of them completed follow-up examinations, with a mean follow-up duration of 4.8 \u00b1 1.6 months (range, 2-9 months). Significantly improved VAS and SF-36 scores were recorded after the initial treatment (P<0.001), suggesting that almost 100% of patients experienced pain relief and an improved quality of life following surgery. No major intervention-related complications (e.g., serious neurovascular injury or infection) occurred during or after the treatment. We recorded only three minor posttreatment complications (6.4%, 3/47), which were related to thermal injury that caused myofasciitis and affected wound healing. CONCLUSION In our study, the short-term efficacy of MWA was considerably favorable, with a relatively low rate of complications. Our results also showed that MWA was effective for pain relief and improved patients' quality of life, making it a feasible treatment alternative for bone tumors.", "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has recently become a worldwide outbreak with several millions of people infected and more than 160.000 deaths. A fast and accurate diagnosis in this outbreak is critical to isolate and treat patients. Radiology plays an important role in the diagnosis and management of the patients. Among various imaging modalities, chest CT has received attention with its higher sensitivity and specificity rates. Shortcomings of the real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction test, including inappropriate sample collection and analysis methods, initial false negative results, and limited availability has led to widespread use of chest CT in the diagnostic algorithm. This review summarizes the role of radiology in COVID-19 pneumonia, diagnostic accuracy of imaging, and chest CT findings of the disease.", " Laparoscopic single-port surgery has widely been introduced for the treatment of various abdominal conditions. But controversies still exist regarding its potential advantages and risks, especially for emergency surgery. The aim of this study was to evaluate the results of a single-port laparoscopic repair using straight laparoscopic instruments for the treatment of perforated duodenal ulcers. METHODS A prospective consecutive case series was conducted including all patients with a perforated duodenal ulcer who underwent a laparoscopic single-port repair at a single institution from January 2012 to June 2018. The operation was performed through a single port using conventional straight laparoscopic instruments and intra-corporeal knot tying techniques. RESULTS Out of 75 patients, simple closure of the perforation without omental patch was accomplished in 96% of cases. Conversion to an open operation was required in one patient (1.3%) due to a posterior duodenal perforation, and additional trocar placement was needed in another patient (1.3%). The mean incision length was 2.0 \u00b1 0.2 cm. The mean operation time was 63.0 \u00b1 26.6 min. Meantime a nasogastric tube remained in place was 2.9 \u00b1 0.8 days. Mean duration of analgesic use was 2.8 \u00b1 0.8 days. The rate of postoperative complications was 2.7%, including two patients with wound infections. There were no instances of intestinal leak or abscess. The postoperative hospital stay was 5.7 \u00b1 1.2 days. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic single-port repair using conventional straight laparoscopic instruments with intra-corporeal knot tying technique was safe and feasible for patients with perforated duodenal ulcers with low risk factors. This method offers results comparable to those expected with the standard multiport laparoscopic approach with the addition of improved cosmetic outcomes.", "PURPOSE Metal-on-metal total disc replacement is a recent alternative treatment for degenerative disc disease. Wear and corrosion of these implants can lead to local and systemic transport of metal debris. This prospective longitudinal study examined the serum chromium and cobalt levels in 24 patients with cobalt-chromium alloy metal-on-metal lumbar disc replacements. METHODS Serum was assayed for chromium (Cr) and cobalt (Co) using high-resolution inductively-coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Detection limits were 0.015 ng/mL for Cr and 0.04 ng/mL for Co. RESULTS Median serum Co levels at pre-op, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36-months post-op were 0.10, 1.03, 0.96, 0.98, 0.67, and 0.52 ng/mL, respectively. Median serum Cr levels were 0.06, 0.49, 0.65, 0.43, 0.52, and 0.50 ng/mL, respectively. CONCLUSION In general, these results indicated that serum Co and Cr levels are elevated at all postoperative time points and are of the same order of magnitude as those observed in well-functioning metal-on-metal surface replacements of the hip and in metal-on-metal total hip replacements at similar postoperative time points.", " Despite increasing use of laparoscopic appendectomy, data demonstrating outcomes of this technique exclusively among the elderly population are scarce. This study aimed to compare 30-day postoperative morbidity and length of hospital stay among elderly patients after appendectomy. METHODS Appendicitis patients older than 65 years were extracted from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Project (NSQIP) database. Demographics and rates of complications for patients undergoing open and laparoscopic appendectomies were compared. Uni- and multivariate analyses adjusted for differences between groups compared the end points of major and minor complications as well as the days of hospital stay after initial surgery. RESULTS A total of 3,335 patients underwent appendectomy, with 2,235 patients (67%) receiving a laparoscopic procedure. The open appendectomy patients were significantly older and more likely to have various preoperative comorbidities (p<0.05). No difference in median operative time between the two techniques was found. Both required 51 min (p=0.11). The open cases had higher rates of both major and minor postoperative complications than the laparoscopic cases (p<0.0001), both overall and before discharge. Multivariate analysis showed no association between operative approach and major complications, and a reduced risk of minor complications with laparoscopy. Length of surgical stay was longer for the open group than for the laparoscopically treated group (median, 4 days vs 2 days; p<0.05). After adjustment, laparoscopy still was significantly associated with a shorter hospital stay than open appendectomy (p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic appendectomy is a safe procedure for elderly patients. During the 30-day postoperative period, no correlation with major complications was found, and the findings showed a beneficial association with regard to minor complications. After adjustment for perioperative factors, laparoscopy is associated with a shorter hospital stay than open appendectomy.", "The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is clinically characterized by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is responsible for a high number of patients needing mechanical ventilation or intensive care units treatment and for the elevated mortality risk. A link between COVID-19 and multiorgan failure may be dependent on the fact that most COVID-19 patients are complicated by pneumonia, which is known to be associated with early changes of clotting and platelet activation and artery dysfunction; these changes may implicate in thrombotic-related events such as myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke. Recent data showed that myocardial injury compatible with coronary ischemia may be detectable in SARS-CoV-2 patients and laboratory data exploring clotting system suggest the presence of a hypercoagulation state. Thus, we performed a systematic review of COVID-19 literature reporting measures of clotting activation to assess if changes are detectable in this setting and their relationship with clinical severity. Furthermore, we discussed the biologic plausibility of the thrombotic risk in SARS-CoV-2 and the potential use of an antithrombotic treatment.", "Human lungs single cell RNA sequencing data from healthy donors (elderly and young; GEO accession number GSE122960) were analyzed to isolate and specifically study gene expression in alveolar type II cells. Co-localization of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 enables SARS-CoV 2 to enter the cells. Expression of these genes in the alveolar type II cells of elderly and young patients were comparable and therefore do not seem to be responsible for worse outcomes observed in COVID-19 affected elderly. In cells from the elderly, 263 genes were downregulated and 95 upregulated. SOD3 was identified as the top-ranked gene that was most down-regulated in the elderly. Other redox-active genes that were also downregulated in cells from the elderly included ATF4 and M2TA. ATF4, an ER stress sensor that defends lungs via induction of heme oxygenase 1. The study of downstream factors known to be induced by ATF4, according to Ingenuity Pathway AnalysisTM, identified 24 candidates. Twenty-one of these were significantly downregulated in the cells from the elderly. These downregulated candidates were subjected to enrichment using the Reactome Database identifying that in the elderly, the ability to respond to heme deficiency and the ATF4-dependent ability to respond to endoplasmic reticulum stress is significantly compromised. SOD3-based therapeutic strategies have provided beneficial results in treating lung disorders including fibrosis. The findings of this work propose the hypotheses that lung-specific delivery of SOD3/ATF4 related antioxidants may work in synergy with promising anti-viral drugs such as remdesivir to further improve COVID-19 outcomes in the elderly.", " After cancer surgery, complications, and disability prevent some patients from receiving subsequent treatments. Given that an inability to complete all intended cancer therapies might negate the oncologic benefits of surgical therapy, strategies to improve return to intended oncologic treatment (RIOT), including minimally invasive surgery (MIS), are being investigated. METHODS This project was designed to evaluate liver tumor patients to determine the RIOT rate, risk factors for inability to RIOT, and its impact on survivals. Outcomes for a homogenous cohort of 223 patients who underwent open-approach surgery for metachronous colorectal liver metastases and a group of 27 liver tumor patients treated with MIS hepatectomy were examined. RESULTS Of the 223 open-approach patients, 167 were offered postoperative therapy, yielding a RIOT rate of 75%. The remaining 56 (25%) patients were unable to receive further treatment due to surgical complications (n = 29 pts) or poor performance status (n = 27 pts). Risk factors associated with inability to RIOT were hypertension (OR 2.2, P = 0.025), multiple preoperative chemotherapy regimens (OR 5.9, P = 0.039), and postoperative complications (OR 2.0, P = 0.039). Inability to RIOT correlated with shorter disease-free and overall survivals (P < 0.001, HR = 2.16; and P = 0.005, HR = 2.07, respectively). In contrast to the open surgery group, 100% of MIS patients who were intended to initiate postoperative therapy did so (P = 0.038) within a shorter median time interval (MIS: 15 days vs. open: 42 days; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The relationship between RIOT and long-term oncologic outcomes suggests that RIOT rates for both open- and MIS-approach cancer surgery should routinely be reported as a quality indicator.", " Occurrence of abdominal wall hernias during and before peritoneal dialysis constitutes a pivotal role in treatment discontinuation, failure, and exclusion from this dialysis method. We herein present a single-center experience regarding a one-stage surgical strategy, including hernia repair and simultaneous peritoneal dialysis catheter implantation. PATIENTS AND METHODS Over a 4-year period, 123 patients underwent peritoneal dialysis catheter implantation and 23 patients (19%) had concomitant abdominal wall hernias and were enrolled in this monocentric prospective study. Data collection included recurrent and new-onset hernias, surgical site infection, 1-year and 2-year catheter survival. RESULTS In 23 patients, 27 hernia repairs combined with peritoneal dialysis catheter implantation were performed. Median age was 52 years (range, 30-85 years) and 18/23 (78%) patients were male. There were no recurrent hernias and no early surgical site infections. Daily flushing was regularly started on the 1st to 3rd postoperative day. Five patients (22%) developed hernias on other anatomical sites, which required hernia repair and perioperative discontinuation of peritoneal dialysis. After a median follow-up of 37 months (range, 28-87 months), 96% of all implanted catheters were still working. CONCLUSION Hernia repair and simultaneous peritoneal dialysis catheter implantation are associated with no recurrent hernias, an early start of peritoneal dialysis, a very low postoperative morbidity and very high 1-year and 2-year catheter survival.", "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral infection that can, in severe cases, result in cytokine storm, systemic inflammatory response and coagulopathy that is prognostic of poor outcomes. While some, but not all, laboratory findings appear similar to sepsis-associated disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), COVID-19- induced coagulopathy (CIC) appears to be more prothrombotic than hemorrhagic. It has been postulated that CIC may be an uncontrolled immunothrombotic response to COVID-19, and there is growing evidence of venous and arterial thromboembolic events in these critically ill patients. Clinicians around the globe are challenged with rapidly identifying reasonable diagnostic, monitoring and anticoagulant strategies to safely and effectively manage these patients. Thoughtful use of proven, evidence-based approaches must be carefully balanced with integration of rapidly emerging evidence and growing experience. The goal of this document is to provide guidance from the Anticoagulation Forum, a North American organization of anticoagulation providers, regarding use of anticoagulant therapies in patients with COVID-19. We discuss in-hospital and post-discharge venous thromboembolism (VTE) prevention, treatment of suspected but unconfirmed VTE, laboratory monitoring of COVID-19, associated anticoagulant therapies, and essential elements for optimized transitions of care specific to patients with COVID-19.", "Endovascular mechanical thrombectomy (MT) is reserved for acute ischaemic stroke secondary to large vessel occlusion. The various MT techniques employed in the treatment of hyperacute strokes are constantly evolving with new devices and improvisation of existing technology (Wahlgren, et al 2016). In this review, we describe a variety of MT techniques gained from our experience of performing over 350 procedures in 7 years of providing a 24/7 service within the national framework of a hyperacute stroke centre. We outline a number of endovascular techniques, procedure limitations, and potential complications.", "OBJECTIVE Spacer gel is used to reduce the rectal dose in prostate radiotherapy. It is injected to increase the distance between the prostate and rectum. During the course of external radiotherapy treatment, physiological changes in rectal volume exist. When using polyethylene glycol material, such as DuraSeal(\u00ae) (Covidien, Mansfield, MA), gel resorption also occurs. Together, these factors alter the original dose plan distribution. METHODS External dose planning and calculations were simulated using images acquired from 10 patients who were treated with brachytherapy and gel. The CT series was taken relative to gel injection: pre 1 day, post 1 day, post 1 month and post 2 months. Adaptive planning was compared with a single plan. RESULTS Adaptive planning shows better results compared with the single plan used in the total treatment course; however, the effect is minor. CONCLUSION Gel usage is clearly favourable to rectal DVH. Using adaptive planning with gel improves rectal DVH but is not necessary according to this study. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE Spacer gel is used in prostate radiotherapy to increase distance between the prostate and the rectum, thus reducing the rectal doses. During the treatment course, gel resorption exists which affects the rectal doses. The usefulness of adaptive planning to compensate this resorption effect has not been studied before.", "IMPORTANCE Although use of oral anticoagulants (OACs) is increasing, there is a substantial lack of data on how to treat OAC-associated intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). OBJECTIVE To assess the association of anticoagulation reversal and blood pressure (BP) with hematoma enlargement and the effects of OAC resumption. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective cohort study at 19 German tertiary care centers (2006-2012) including 1176 individuals for analysis of long-term functional outcome, 853 for analysis of hematoma enlargement, and 719 for analysis of OAC resumption. EXPOSURES Reversal of anticoagulation during acute phase, systolic BP at 4 hours, and reinitiation of OAC for long-term treatment. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Frequency of hematoma enlargement in relation to international normalized ratio (INR) and BP. Incidence analysis of ischemic and hemorrhagic events with or without OAC resumption. Factors associated with favorable (modified Rankin Scale score, 0-3) vs unfavorable functional outcome. RESULTS Hemorrhage enlargement occurred in 307 of 853 patients (36.0%). Reduced rates of hematoma enlargement were associated with reversal of INR levels <1.3 within 4 hours after admission (43/217 [19.8%]) vs INR of \u22651.3 (264/636 [41.5%]; P < .001) and systolic BP <160 mm Hg at 4 hours (167/504 [33.1%]) vs \u2265160 mm Hg (98/187 [52.4%]; P < .001). The combination of INR reversal <1.3 within 4 hours and systolic BP of <160 mm Hg at 4 hours was associated with lower rates of hematoma enlargement (35/193 [18.1%] vs 220/498 [44.2%] not achieving these values; OR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.19-0.42; P < .001) and lower rates of in-hospital mortality (26/193 [13.5%] vs 103/498 [20.7%]; OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.37-0.95; P = .03). OAC was resumed in 172 of 719 survivors (23.9%). OAC resumption showed fewer ischemic complications (OAC: 9/172 [5.2%] vs no OAC: 82/547 [15.0%]; P < .001) and not significantly different hemorrhagic complications (OAC: 14/172 [8.1%] vs no OAC: 36/547 [6.6%]; P = .48). Propensity-matched survival analysis in patients with atrial fibrillation who restarted OAC showed a decreased HR of 0.258 (95% CI, 0.125-0.534; P < .001) for long-term mortality. Functional long-term outcome was unfavorable in 786 of 1083 patients (72.6%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with OAC-associated ICH, reversal of INR <1.3 within 4 hours and systolic BP <160 mm Hg at 4 hours were associated with lower rates of hematoma enlargement, and resumption of OAC therapy was associated with lower risk of ischemic events. These findings require replication and assessment in prospective studies. TRIAL REGISTRATION clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01829581.", "Importance Reperfusion is a key factor for clinical outcome in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) treated with endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) for large-vessel intracranial occlusion. However, data are scarce on the association between the time from onset and reperfusion results. Objective To analyze the rate of reperfusion after EVT started at different intervals after symptom onset in patients with AIS. Design, Setting, and Participants We conducted a meta-analysis of individual patient data from 7 randomized trials of the Highly Effective Reperfusion Using Multiple Endovascular Devices (HERMES) group. This is a multicenter cohort study of the intervention arm of randomized clinical trials included in the HERMES group. Patients with anterior circulation AIS who underwent EVT for M1/M2 or intracranial carotid artery occlusion were included. Each trial enrolled patients according to its specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data on patients eligible but not enrolled (eg, refusals or exclusions) were not available. All analyses were performed by the HERMES biostatistical core laboratory using the pooled database. Data were analyzed between December 2010 and April 2015. Main Outcomes and Measures Successful reperfusion was defined as a modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction score of 2b/3 at the end of the EVT procedure adjusted for age, occlusion location, pretreatment intravenous thrombolysis, and clot burden score and was analyzed in relation to different intervals (onset, emergency department arrival, imaging, and puncture) using mixed-methods logistic regression. Results Among the 728 included patients, with a mean (SD) age of 65.4 (13.5) years and of whom 345 were female (47.4%), decreases in rates of successful reperfusion defined as a thrombolysis in cerebral infarction score of 2b/3 were observed with increasing time from admission or first imaging to groin puncture. The magnitude of effect was a 22% relative reduction (odds ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.64-0.95) per additional hour between admission and puncture and a 26% relative reduction (odds ratio, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.59-0.93) per additional hour between imaging and puncture. Conclusions and Relevance Because the probability of reperfusion declined significantly with time between hospital arrival and groin puncture, we provide additional arguments for minimizing the intervals after symptom onset in anterior circulation acute ischemic stroke.", " In the past decade, several new surgical tools have revived the hope for an improved technique to treat radically hemorrhoids with less postoperative pain. Among these radiofrequency (RF), excisional surgery seems to be safe, fast, and accompanied by less postoperative pain. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare RF (ligasure TM) to conventional diathermy Milligan-Morgan hemorrhoidectomy (MMH). PATIENTS AND METHODS Between January 2003 and July 2009, 210 symptomatic patients were randomized to undergo RF (118 patients) or diathermy MMH (92 patients). Mean follow-up was 39 \u00b1 16 months. Clinical outcome was assessed by validated questionnaire on postoperative symptoms and satisfaction. Primary endpoints were pain and wound healing. Secondary endpoints were operative time, early and late complications (including recurrences), and patient satisfaction. Data was analyzed using chi-squared test and Fisher's exact test. RESULTS Despite postoperative pain was less after RF, this difference was significant only for severe pain (expressed as VAS score >7). Significant differences were observed in terms of wound healing. The two techniques were similar in terms of early and late complications. CONCLUSIONS RF hemorrhoidectomy is followed by reduced severe pain and better wound healing. However, in our experience, this is not followed by earlier return to daily activities.", "OBJECTIVE To describe the incidence of patient-ventilator asynchrony and different types of asynchrony in preterm infants treated with non-synchronised nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (nIPPV). DESIGN An observational study was conducted including preterm infants born with a gestational age (GA) less than 32 weeks treated with non-synchronised nIPPV. During 1 hour, spontaneous breathing was measured with transcutaneous electromyography of the diaphragm simultaneous with ventilator inflations. An asynchrony index (AI), a percentage of asynchronous breaths, was calculated and the incidence of different types of inspiratory and expiratory asynchrony were reported. RESULTS Twenty-one preterm infants with a mean GA of 26.0\u00b11.2 weeks were included in the study. The mean inspiratory AI was 68.3%\u00b14.7% and the mean expiratory AI was 67.1%\u00b17.3%. Out of 5044 comparisons of spontaneous inspirations and mechanical inflations, 45.3% of the mechanical inflations occurred late, 23.3% of the mechanical inflations were early and 31.4% of the mechanical inflation were synchronous. 40.3% of 5127 expiratory comparisons showed an early termination of ventilator inflations, 26.7% of the mechanical inflations terminated late and 33.0% mechanical inflations terminated in synchrony with a spontaneous expiration. In addition, 1380 spontaneous breaths were unsupported and 611 extra mechanical inflations were delivered. CONCLUSION Non-synchronised nIPPV results in high patient-ventilator asynchrony in preterm infants during both the inspiratory and expiratory phase of the breathing cycle. New synchronisation techniques are urgently needed and should address both inspiratory and expiratory asynchrony.", " AND PURPOSE To assess whether the combined analysis of all phase III trials of nonvitamin-K-antagonist (non-VKA) oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation and previous stroke or transient ischemic attack shows a significant difference in efficacy or safety compared with warfarin. METHODS We searched PubMed until May 31, 2012, for randomized clinical trials using the following search items: atrial fibrillation, anticoagulation, warfarin, and previous stroke or transient ischemic attack. Studies had to be phase III trials in atrial fibrillation patients comparing warfarin with a non-VKA currently on the market or with the intention to be brought to the market in North America or Europe. Analysis was performed on intention-to-treat basis. A fixed-effects model was used as more appropriate than a random-effects model when combining a small number of studies. RESULTS Among 47 potentially eligible articles, 3 were included in the meta-analysis. In 14 527 patients, non-VKAs were associated with a significant reduction of stroke/systemic embolism (odds ratios, 0.85 [95% CI, 074-0.99]; relative risk reduction, 14%; absolute risk reduction, 0.7%; number needed to treat, 134 over 1.8-2.0 years) compared with warfarin. Non-VKAs were also associated with a significant reduction of major bleeding compared with warfarin (odds ratios, 0.86 [95% CI, 075-0.99]; relative risk reduction, 13%; absolute risk reduction, 0.8%; number needed to treat, 125), mainly driven by the significant reduction of hemorrhagic stroke (odds ratios, 0.44 [95% CI, 032-0.62]; relative risk reduction, 57.9%; absolute risk reduction, 0.7%; number needed to treat, 139). CONCLUSIONS In the context of the significant limitations of combining the results of disparate trials of different agents, non-VKAs seem to be associated with a significant reduction in rates of stroke or systemic embolism, hemorrhagic stroke, and major bleeding when compared with warfarin in patients with previous stroke or transient ischemic attack.", " To ensure the safety and efficacy of the increasing number of transvenous lead extractions (TLEs), it is necessary to adequately assess the procedure-related risk. METHODS We analyzed potential clinical and procedural risk factors associated with 2049 TLE procedures. The TLEs were performed between 2006 and 2016 using only simple tools for lead extraction. Logistic regression analysis was used to develop a risk prediction scoring system for TLEs. RESULTS Multivariate analysis showed that the sum of lead dwell times, anemia, female gender, the number of procedures preceding TLE, and removal of leads implanted in patients under the age of 30 had a significant influence on the occurrence of major complications during a TLE. This information served as a basis for developing a predictive SAFeTY TLE score, where: S = sum of lead dwell times, A = anemia, Fe = female, T = treatment (previous procedures), Y = young patients, and TLE = transvenous lead extraction. In order to facilitate the use of the SAFeTY TLE Score, a simple calculator was constructed. CONCLUSION The SAFeTY TLE score is easy to calculate and predicts the potential occurrence of procedure-related major complications. High-risk patients (scoring more than 10 on the SAFeTY TLE scale) must be treated at high-volume centers with surgical backup.", "Purposes Seroma is a postoperative complication following laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal repair (TAPP) for inguinal hernioplasty. Seroma naturally resolves in most cases, but it can lead to an increased amount of visits to the outpatient clinic and can result in anxiety of the patient. Local inflammation of the inguinal area is etiology of seroma formation. Strangulated hernia involves severe inguinal pain and can lead to severe inflammation and subsequent seroma. There have been no reports demonstrating the links of seroma and strangulated hernia. This study aimed to retrospectively evaluate the risk of seroma after TAPP and to identify the association between strangulated hernia and seroma. Methods We treated 300 inguinal hernias by TAPP between 2013 and 2016 at Kurashiki Central Hospital. We used the Chi-square test. Factors significant in each association were further examined using multiple subsequent logistic regressions. Results A total of 222 hernias were eligible for analysis. The incidence of seroma was 11% (n=25). There were nine cases of strangulated hernias, and three (33%) resulted in seroma. The ratio of strangulated hernia of seroma group is significantly high (p<0.03). Multiple subsequent logistic regressions showed that strangulated hernia was associated with a significantly increased risk for seroma formation (p = 0.023; OR 6.564; 95% CI 1.29-33.3). Conclusion This study shows that strangulated hernia can be a risk factor in seroma formation. This risk should be incorporated into a management plan of TAPP for strangulated hernia, with careful consideration of patients' concerns.", "OBJECTIVES: Use of point-of-care testing is increasing, however many haematology analysers can only determine granulocyte count without further differentiation into neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils. Since the diagnosis of life-threatening neutropenia in cancer patients requires a distinct neutrophil count, this study aimed to determine the comparative performance between the neutrophil and granulocyte count. DESIGN AND METHODS: A database of 508 646 venous full blood count results measured on a laboratory reference analyser was mined from a large oncology unit. The relationship between granulocyte and neutrophil counts was assessed. Multinomial logistic regression was used to classify results into neutropenia grades using an equivalent granulocyte count. RESULTS: Granulocyte to neutrophil count correlation was 0.997. The accuracy for classification into neutropenia grades using the derived equivalent granulocyte count ranges was 96.4%. Identification of results with a neutrophil count <1.5\u00d710(9) cells/L using an equivalent granulocyte count of <1.69\u00d710(9) cells/L resulted in sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of 98.0%, 99.5%, 97.8% and 99.5%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These results describe the relationship between granulocyte and neutrophil counts, measured on a laboratory analyser, in a large population of patients with malignancies and receiving anti-cancer therapies. However, this relationship must be established using a point of care testing system with a three-part differential count before considering the possibility that a granulocyte count can guide clinical decisions in the absence of a definitive neutrophil count, to reduce the frequency and severity of neutropenic complications in patients receiving cancer treatments.", "Renal denervation which consists in the ablation of the sympathetic fibers located in the adventitia of renal arteries is a therapeutic strategy allowing improved arterial hypertension control in patients who do not respond to medical treatment. This technique is currently performed using the femoral approach in the majority of cases. The diameter and the length of the ablation catheters limit their use via the radial route. The most frequent peri-procedural complications are vascular problems. We report here two cases of renal denervation via the trans-humeral and trans-radial routes respectively.", " Retrospective studies have drawn attention to possible detrimental effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on the anastomotic leakage rate after colorectal resection. In this study, we examined the effects of the NSAID diclofenac on the breaking strength of an experimental colonic anastomosis and a skin incision as well as subcutaneous collagen accumulation. METHODS This was a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled experimental study in 60 male Wistar rats treated with diclofenac 4 mg/kg/day or placebo. In each rat, a colonic anastomosis was performed and an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) tube was placed subcutaneously. Incisional and anastomotic wound breaking strength and hydroxyproline content in the ePTFE tubes were measured 7 days after the operation. RESULTS We found no significant differences in any of the breaking strength measurements, but showed a median 38% reduction in hydroxyproline deposition as a result of diclofenac treatment (p = 0.03). In the placebo group, subcutaneous collagen deposition tended to correlate positively with skin incisional but negatively with anastomotic bio-mechanical strength. CONCLUSION Postoperative diclofenac treatment significantly inhibited collagen deposition in subcutaneous granulation tissue. Anastomotic strength and skin wound strength were not significantly affected. The ePTFE model is suitable for assessing the effect of various drugs on collagen formation and thus on wound healing.", "Objectives To evaluate the efficacy and safety of carotid artery stenting for the treatment of severe carotid artery disease in our department and to investigate the effect of increasing operator experience on perioperative and procedure-related characteristics. Methods From January 2007 to February 2015 200 patients underwent 207 endovascular procedures for carotid artery stenosis. Of all, 113 arteries (56.5%) were symptomatic. Significant changes across time were calculated with the use of Change Point analysis using bootstrap and mean squared error estimates. Results The technical success was 98.6% (204/207 cases). Thirty-day neurological events included stroke in four patients (2%) and transient ischemic attack in two (1%). None of the patients died during the first 30 days. The most significant change of radiation duration occurred after the 33rd patient with a decrease from 25.31 min to 12.31 min, while for the total operative time that change occurred between the 31st and 33rd patient where mean operation time decreased from 88.89 min to 49.22 min. The most significant change of contrast media used occurred at the 40th patient with a decrease from 91.58 ml to 62 ml. During a mean follow-up period of 42 \u00b1 20.02 months none of the patients experienced any cerebrovascular event. There was one case of significant recurrent stenosis, which was successfully treated by endovascular means. Conclusions Endovascular treatment of carotid artery stenosis performed in a single center with the use of a cerebral protection device seems to consist a safe therapeutic choice with acceptable results, within the referenced benchmarks proposed in the latest guidelines. Certain perioperative parameters such as the amount of contrast media used, the fluoroscopy and operation time, seem to decline overtime indicating increasing operator's experience. A number of performed cases above 40 was related to the significant decrease of those parameters and may represent the learning curve of the procedure.", "The objective of this prospective, blinded study was to compare plasma biochemical values and gross and histologic evaluation of kidney and liver from American alligators ( Alligator mississippiensis ) fed extruded diets with protein derived from animal or plant sources. Alligators in two treatment groups were fed an extruded diet with protein derived primarily from plant products for 7 (n = 20) or 10 (n = 20) mo prior to harvest. A control group (n = 20) was fed a commercial diet with protein derived from animal products for the duration of the study. Plasma biochemistry panels were obtained and gross and histologic examination of kidney and liver tissues was conducted for each animal. No differences were found between alligators fed diets with animal or plant protein in terms of either biochemistry profiles or gross or histologic examination of kidney and liver. Plant-based diets, fed for up to 10 mo, do not appear to have any ill effects on the kidney or liver of American alligators.", " AND PURPOSE Mechanical thrombectomy with a stent retriever applied shortly after symptom onset could increase good functional outcomes and improve survival in patients with acute basilar artery occlusion, but this has not yet been studied. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of mechanical thrombectomy with a Solitaire stent within 8 hours of stroke onset in patients with acute basilar artery occlusion. MATERIALS AND METHODS We analyzed 25 consecutive patients with acute basilar artery occlusion who were treated with mechanical thrombectomy by use of the Solitaire stent within 8 hours of stroke symptom onset. Successful recanalization was defined as TICI grade 2b or 3. Good outcome was defined as mRS score of 0-2 at 3 months. Clinical and radiologic data in patients with good outcomes were compared with those with poor outcomes. RESULTS Successful recanalization was achieved in 96% (24/25) of patients, and 48% (12/25) of patients had good outcomes. Eighty-eight percent (22/25) of patients survived to 3 months. The median NIHSS score on admission was significantly lower in patients with good outcomes than in those with poor outcomes (9.5 versus 14, P = .005). Procedure-related complications occurred in 2 patients (8%). No symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhages occurred. CONCLUSIONS The current study suggests that mechanical thrombectomy by use of a Solitaire stent within 8 hours of stroke onset increases good outcomes and improves survival in patients with acute basilar artery occlusion.", "Background Endovascular thrombectomy improves functional outcome in large vessel occlusion ischemic stroke. We examined disability, quality of life, survival and acute care costs in the EXTEND-IA trial, which used CT-perfusion imaging selection. Methods Large vessel ischemic stroke patients with favorable CT-perfusion were randomized to endovascular thrombectomy after alteplase versus alteplase-only. Clinical outcome was prospectively measured using 90-day modified Rankin scale (mRS). Individual patient expected survival and net difference in Disability/Quality-adjusted life years (DALY/QALY) up to 15 years from stroke were modeled using age, sex, 90-day mRS, and utility scores. Level of care within the first 90 days was prospectively measured and used to estimate procedure and inpatient care costs (US$ reference year 2014). Results There were 70 patients, 35 in each arm, mean age 69, median NIHSS 15 (IQR 12-19). The median (IQR) disability-weighted utility score at 90 days was 0.65 (0.00-0.91) in the alteplase-only versus 0.91 (0.65-1.00) in the endovascular group (p = 0.005). Modeled life expectancy was greater in the endovascular versus alteplase-only group (median 15.6 versus 11.2 years, p = 0.02). The endovascular thrombectomy group had fewer simulated DALYs lost over 15 years [median (IQR) 5.5 (3.2-8.7) versus 8.9 (4.7-13.8), p = 0.02] and more QALY gained [median (IQR) 9.3 (4.2-13.1) versus 4.9 (0.3-8.5), p = 0.03]. Endovascular patients spent less time in hospital [median (IQR) 5 (3-11) days versus 8 (5-14) days, p = 0.04] and rehabilitation [median (IQR) 0 (0-28) versus 27 (0-65) days, p = 0.03]. The estimated inpatient costs in the first 90 days were less in the thrombectomy group (average US$15,689 versus US$30,569, p = 0.008) offsetting the costs of interhospital transport and the thrombectomy procedure (average US$10,515). The average saving per patient treated with thrombectomy was US$4,365. Conclusion Thrombectomy patients with large vessel occlusion and salvageable tissue on CT-perfusion had reduced length of stay and overall costs to 90 days. There was evidence of clinically relevant improvement in long-term survival and quality of life.

Occasionally, it can lead to one of the most common deep space head and neck infections, peritonsillar abscess. The epidemiology, microbiology and treatment of tonsillitis and peritonsillar abscess are similar and crucial for the primary care physician, infectious disease specialist, otolaryngologist, and emergency medicine physician to understand. The routine use of tonsillectomy as a treatment option for recurrent tonsillitis and peritonsillar abscess has decreased over the last decade and clearer indications for surgery have emerged. This chapter provides an overview of the most recent literature regarding the epidemiology, microbiology, diagnosis, complications and management of tonsillitis and peritonsillar abscess. It also discusses the indications for tonsillectomy along with its complications.", " AND PURPOSE Internal carotid artery dissection is a common cause of stroke in young adults. It may be responsible for tandem occlusion defined by a cervical steno-occlusive carotid wall hematoma associated with an intracranial large-vessel stroke. Intravenous thrombolysis is associated with a poor clinical outcome in these cases, and endovascular treatment has not been specifically evaluated to date. Our aim was to evaluate endovascular treatment technical and clinical efficiency in this specific occlusion topography, in comparison with treatment of isolated anterior circulation stroke. MATERIALS AND METHODS As part of our ongoing prospective stroke data base started in August 2009 (Prognostic Factors Related to Clinical Outcome Following Thrombectomy in Ischemic Stroke [RECOST] Study), we analyzed all carotid artery dissection tandem occlusion strokes and isolated anterior circulation occlusions. All patients were selected for endovascular treatment according to clinical-radiologic mismatch, NIHSS \u2265 7 and DWI-ASPECTS \u22655, within 6 hours after onset. For carotid artery dissection, the revascularization procedure consisted first of distal recanalization by a stent retriever in the intracranial vessel. Following assessment of the circle of Willis, internal carotid artery stent placement was only performed in case of insufficiency. Carotid artery dissection treatment efficacy, safety, and clinical outcome were compared with the results of the isolated anterior circulation occlusion cohort. RESULTS Two hundred fifty-eight patients with an anterior circulation stroke were analyzed, including 57 with tandem occlusions (22%); among them, 20 were carotid artery dissection-related occlusions (7.6%). The median age of patients with tandem occlusions with internal carotid dissection was 52.45 versus 66.85 years for isolated anterior circulation occlusion (P < .05); the mean initial NIHSS score was 17.53 \u00b1 4.11 versus 17.55 \u00b1 4.8 (P = .983). The median DWI-ASPECTS was 6.05 versus 6.64 (P = .098), and the average time from onset to puncture was 4.38 for tandem occlusions versus 4.53 hours in isolated anterior circulation occlusion (P = .704). Complication rates and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage were comparable in both groups (5% versus 3%, P = .49). The duration of the procedure was significantly prolonged in case of tandem occlusion (80.69 versus 65.45 minutes, P = .030). Fourteen patients with carotid artery dissection (70%) had a 3-month mRS of \u2264 2, without a significant difference from patients with an isolated anterior circulation occlusion (44%, P = .2). Only 5 carotid artery dissections (25%) necessitated cervical stent placement. No early ipsilateral stroke recurrence was recorded, despite the absence of stent placement in 15 patients (75%) with carotid artery dissection. CONCLUSIONS Mechanical endovascular treatment of carotid artery dissection tandem occlusions is safe and effective compared with isolated anterior circulation occlusion stroke therapy. Hence, a more conservative approach with stent placement only in cases of circle of Willis insufficiency may be a reliable and safe strategy.", "/PURPOSE There has not been any study comparing laparoscopic abdominoperineal rectoplasty (ARP) with open ARP. This study investigated the true benefits of the laparoscopic approach in infants with high anorectal malformation. PATIENTS AND METHODS A retrospective analysis was performed in 28 infants with high anorectal malformation treated between 1990 and 2007. Fifteen were treated by open ARP, and 13 were treated by laparoscopic ARP. Surgical durations, amount of bleeding, complications, anorectal pressure measurements, barium enema study, and clinical assessment were compared between the 2 groups. RESULTS The amount of intraoperative bleeding was significantly less in laparoscopic ARP (12 \u00b1 11 g) than in open ARP (65 \u00b1 44 g) (P = .003). Anal resting pressure was 34 \u00b1 9 cm H(2)O after laparoscopic ARP and 31 \u00b1 14 cm H(2)O after open ARP. Anorectal reflex was positive in 1 (7%) of 15 after open ARP and 3 (23%) of 13 after laparoscopic ARP. There was no significant difference in barium enema study and clinical assessment between the 2 groups. With regard to postoperative complications, mucosal prolapse occurred in 10 (67%) of 15 after open ARP and in none of 13 after laparoscopic ARP (P = .003). CONCLUSION Benefits of the laparoscopic approach were reduced intraoperative bleeding and a lower incidence of postoperative anal mucosal prolapse. These results indicate that minimal dissection of the mesorectum in laparoscopic ARP may provide those better outcomes.", "PURPOSE The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of microwave (MW) ablation of liver metastases guided by B-mode ultrasound (US) and contrast-enhanced US (CEUS). MATERIALS AND METHODS 39 patients (17 women and 22 men) with a total of 125 liver metastases were treated with percutaneous or intraoperative CEUS-guided MW ablation. The primary tumor was colorectal cancer (n = 31), breast cancer (n = 6), carcinoid tumor (n = 1), and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) (n = 1). The median number of metastases ablated in the 45 treatment sessions was 2 (range 1 - 11). The median size (maximum diameter) of the 125 metastases was 1.5 cm (range, 0.6 - 4.0 cm). Nineteen (15 %) of the 125 metastases were bigger than 2 cm. Metastases smaller than 2 cm were treated with a single needle, metastases bigger than 2 cm were treated with 2 or 3 parallel needles. RESULTS The 45 MW ablation sessions were performed percutaneously (n = 30), during laparotomy (n = 3), or during laparotomy combined with liver resection (n = 12). The 39 patients were followed up for at least 4 months with a median duration of 11 months (range, 4 - 20 months). The technical success rate was 100 %. The clinical effectiveness was 100 % with complete coverage of the metastasis by the avascular coagulation zone evaluated on immediate post-ablation CEUS. Local tumor progression (local recurrence) was seen in 12 (9.6 %) of the 125 treated metastases, and affected 10 (26 %) of the 39 patients. One major complication was observed in the form of a liver abscess that easily resolved after percutaneous drainage. Four minor complications were observed: Three cases of pain located at the puncture site and one case of ascites. CEUS was valuable in all phases of ablation including pre-ablation staging and procedure planning, placement of MW needles in the tumor, immediate post-ablation control of coagulation size, and finally in the long term follow-up regime. CONCLUSION CEUS-guided MW ablation of liver metastases is an efficient and safe ablation technique with several advantages compared to other ablation modalities.", "OBJECTIVES This study sought to investigate the effect of treatment delay on microvascular reperfusion in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients from the large, multicenter, prospective HORIZONS-AMI (Harmonizing Outcomes with Revascularization and Stents in Acute Myocardial Infarction) trial.  Despite restoration of epicardial blood flow during primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), one-third of patients do not obtain myocardial perfusion due to impairment in the microvascular circulation. METHODS We examined the effect of symptom onset-to-balloon time (SBT) and door-to-balloon time (DBT) on myocardial reperfusion during primary PCI in STEMI, utilizing resolution of ST-segment elevation (STR) and the myocardial blush grade (MBG). The primary analysis was the relationships between SBT \u22642, >2 to 4, and >4 h and DBT \u22641, >1 to 1.5, >1.5 to 2, and >2 h with MBG and STR. Clinical risk was assessed using a modified version of the Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction risk score for STEMI. RESULTS In 2,056 patients, absent microvascular perfusion (MBG 0/1) and STR (STR <30%) after primary PCI was significantly more common in patients with longer SBT, in patients with both low and high clinical risk profiles. By multivariable analysis, SBT (p < 0.0001), anterior infarction (p < 0.0001), reference vessel diameter (p = 0.005), lesion minimum lumen diameter (p < 0.0001), hyperlipidemia (p = 0.03), and current smoking (p = 0.001) were independent predictors of MBG 0/1, whereas SBT (p = 0.007), anterior infarction (p < 0.0001), and history of renal insufficiency (p = 0.0002) were independent predictors of absent STR. DBT (p < 0.0001) was an independent predictor of MBG 0/1. MBG 0/1 and STR<30% identified patients with increased 3-year mortality. CONCLUSIONS The present study suggests that delay in mechanical reperfusion therapy during STEMI is associated with greater injury to the microcirculation.", "PURPOSE OF REVIEW The higher prevalence of psychiatric disorders in multiple sclerosis (MS) compared with the general population is well documented, with depression being the leading disorder. Apart from depression, other psychiatric disorders and symptoms such as bipolar disorder, pseudobulbar affect, euphoria sclerotica, anxiety and personality changes are also reported to be overpresented in MS patients. Psychiatric disorders in MS lead to significant disruption in patients' family, work and social life, affecting patients' quality of life in general. Moreover, they are reported to be associated with poorer adherence to MS medication. The literature concerning bipolar disorder and affect disorders in MS is rather scarce. The purpose of this article is to provide a critical review on the latter subject. RECENT FINDINGS This review focuses upon the recent findings with regard to the epidemiology and the comorbidity rates of bipolar and affect disorders in MS, questions raised about the potential underlying mechanisms that could explain such a high comorbidity, diagnostic issues and the recent developments in the treatment of those psychiatric disorders in MS. SUMMARY Despite the fact that the higher prevalence of psychiatric disorders in MS is well established, such disorders still remain underdiagnosed and undertreated. A shift in the clinical suspicion towards the psychiatric morbidity in MS patients and the optimal treatment of those disorders is fundamental.", "OBJECTIVE The authors performed a pooled analysis of 3 studies-IntrePED (International Retrospective Study of the Pipeline Embolization Device), PUFS (Pipeline for Uncoilable or Failed Aneurysms Study), and ASPIRe (Aneurysm Study of Pipeline in an Observational Registry)-in order to assess angiographic outcomes and clinical safety of the Pipeline embolization device (PED). METHODS IntrePED was a retrospective study, while PUFS and ASPIRe were prospective studies. For each patient included in these studies, the authors collected baseline demographic data, aneurysm characteristics, and procedural details. The primary outcomes for this combined analysis were clinical outcomes, including neurological morbidity and mortality and major ipsilateral intracranial hemorrhage and ischemic stroke. The secondary outcomes were angiographic occlusion rates, which were available for ASPIRe and PUFS only. RESULTS A total of 1092 patients with 1221 aneurysms were included across the 3 studies. The mean aneurysm size was 12.0 \u00b1 7.8 mm and the mean neck size was 6.6 \u00b1 4.8 mm. The major ipsilateral ischemic stroke rate was 3.7% (40/1091). The major ipsilateral intracranial hemorrhage rate was 2.0% (22/1091). The major neurological morbidity rate was 5.7% (62/1091). The neurological mortality rate was 3.3% (36/1091). The combined major morbidity and neurological mortality rate was 7.1% (78/1091). The complete occlusion rates were 75.0% at 180 days (111/148) and 85.5% at 1 year (94/110). The overall aneurysm retreatment rate was 3.0% (33/1091) at a mean follow-up time of 10.2 \u00b1 10.8 months. CONCLUSIONS Endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms with the PED is safe and effective. Angiographic occlusion rates progressed with follow-up. Rates of stroke, hemorrhage, morbidity and mortality, and retreatment were low, especially given the fact that the aneurysms treated were generally large and wide necked.", "Objectives The far-lateral approach is widely used to treat pathology of the ventral foramen magnum. Numerous methods of exposure have been described, most of which utilize long skin incisions and myocutaneous flaps. Here we present our experience with gaining exposure through a small paramedian incision using a muscle-splitting technique. Design A cadaveric anatomical study was first performed to verify the feasibility of the approach. We then describe our experience with using the approach in 13 patients. A retrospective chart review was performed and data regarding pathology, imaging, and complications were collected. Results The cadaveric study confirmed that a small paramedian muscle-splitting approach allows sufficient exposure to approach many foramen magnum lesions. Our case series included 10 patients with meningioma, one brainstem glioblastoma, one posterior inferior cerebellar artery aneurysm, and one odontoid pannus. The exposure was adequate in all cases. For the meningioma patients, six had gross total resections and four had subtotal resection because of tumor adherence to neurovascular structures. Two patients experienced postoperative cardiovascular complications. There were no new neurologic deficits, cerebrospinal fluid leaks, or wound complications. Conclusions A small paramedian incision may be used to gain exposure and perform successful far-lateral approaches. The small exposure is likely to reduce the risk of local complications such as cerebrospinal fluid fistula and pseudomeningocele when compared with larger exposures.", " Thymosin alpha 1 (T\u03b11) is a naturally occurring polypeptide of 28 amino acids, whose mechanism of action is thought to be related to its ability to signal through innate immune receptors. T\u03b11 (ZADAXIN\u00ae) is used worldwide for treating viral infections, immunodeficiencies, and malignancies. Owing to its ability to activate the tolerogenic pathway of tryptophan catabolism - via the immunoregulatory enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase - T\u03b11 potentiates immune tolerance mechanisms, breaking the vicious circle that perpetuates chronic inflammation in response to a variety of infectious noxae. AREAS COVERED T\u03b11 has never been studied in Cystic fibrosis (CF) in which the hyperinflammatory state is associated with early and nonresolving activation of innate immunity, which impairs microbial clearance and promotes a self-sustaining condition of progressive lung damage. Optimal CF treatments should, indeed, not only rescue CF transmembrane conductance regulator protein localization and functionality but also alleviate the associated hyperinflammatory pathology. Because of the inherent complexity of the pathogenetic mechanisms, a multidrug approach is required. EXPERT OPINION By providing a multipronged attack against CF, i.e. restraining inflammation and correcting the basic defect, T\u03b11 favorably opposed CF symptomatology in preclinical relevant disease settings, thus suggesting its possible exploitation for 'real-life' clinical efficacy in CF. This could represent a major conceptual advance in the CF field, namely the proposal of a drug with the unique activity to correct CFTR defects through regulation of inflammation.", " AND PURPOSE The role of flow diversion in the management of aneurysms remains unknown. We sought to evaluate the community agreement regarding indications for flow diversion. MATERIALS AND METHODS A portfolio of 35 difficult aneurysm cases was sent to 40 clinicians with varying backgrounds and experience. Responders were asked whether they considered flow diversion a treatment option, whether other options were possible, whether recruitment in a randomized trial would be considered, and to select their final choice. Agreement was studied by using \u03ba statistics. RESULTS Decisions for flow diversion were more frequent (n = 300, 39%) than decisions to coil (n = 163, 21.2%), to observe (n = 121, 15.7%), to occlude the parent vessel (n = 102, 13.2%), or to clip (n = 66, 8.6%). Sidewall aneurysm morphology was associated with flow diversion as the final choice (P = .001). Interjudge agreement was fair at best (\u03ba <0.3) for all cases and all judges, despite high certainty levels (range, 7.2-8.9 \u00b1 2.0 on a 0-10 scale). Agreement was no better within specialties or with more experience. All patients were judged to have other treatment options. Judges were willing to offer trial participation in 417 of 741 (56.3%) scenarios, more frequently when the aneurysm was sidewall (P = .001) or in the anterior circulation (P = .028). CONCLUSIONS Individuals did not agree regarding the indications for flow diversion. There is sufficient uncertainty to justify trials designed to protect patients from the potential risks of premature adoption of an innovation.", "IMPORTANCE Small trials suggest that postoperative outcomes may be improved by the use of cardiac output monitoring to guide administration of intravenous fluid and inotropic drugs as part of a hemodynamic therapy algorithm. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the clinical effectiveness of a perioperative, cardiac output-guided hemodynamic therapy algorithm. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS OPTIMISE was a pragmatic, multicenter, randomized, observer-blinded trial of 734 high-risk patients aged 50 years or older undergoing major gastrointestinal surgery at 17 acute care hospitals in the United Kingdom. An updated systematic review and meta-analysis were also conducted including randomized trials published from 1966 to February 2014. INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomly assigned to a cardiac output-guided hemodynamic therapy algorithm for intravenous fluid and inotrope (dopexamine) infusion during and 6 hours following surgery (n=368) or to usual care (n=366). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was a composite of predefined 30-day moderate or major complications and mortality. Secondary outcomes were morbidity on day 7; infection, critical care-free days, and all-cause mortality at 30 days; all-cause mortality at 180 days; and length of hospital stay. RESULTS Baseline patient characteristics, clinical care, and volumes of intravenous fluid were similar between groups. Care was nonadherent to the allocated treatment for less than 10% of patients in each group. The primary outcome occurred in 36.6% of intervention and 43.4% of usual care participants (relative risk [RR], 0.84 [95% CI, 0.71-1.01]; absolute risk reduction, 6.8% [95% CI, -0.3% to 13.9%]; P = .07). There was no significant difference between groups for any secondary outcomes. Five intervention patients (1.4%) experienced cardiovascular serious adverse events within 24 hours compared with none in the usual care group. Findings of the meta-analysis of 38 trials, including data from this study, suggest that the intervention is associated with fewer complications (intervention, 488/1548 [31.5%] vs control, 614/1476 [41.6%]; RR, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.71-0.83]) and a nonsignificant reduction in hospital, 28-day, or 30-day mortality (intervention, 159/3215 deaths [4.9%] vs control, 206/3160 deaths [6.5%]; RR, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.67-1.01]) and mortality at longest follow-up (intervention, 267/3215 deaths [8.3%] vs control, 327/3160 deaths [10.3%]; RR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.74-1.00]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In a randomized trial of high-risk patients undergoing major gastrointestinal surgery, use of a cardiac output-guided hemodynamic therapy algorithm compared with usual care did not reduce a composite outcome of complications and 30-day mortality. However, inclusion of these data in an updated meta-analysis indicates that the intervention was associated with a reduction in complication rates. TRIAL REGISTRATION isrctn.org Identifier: ISRCTN04386758.", " Whilst laparoscopic repair is the most common surgical procedure for the treatment of large hiatal hernias, knowledge of long-term outcomes (>10 years) is scarce. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term results following this approach, in particular the hernia recurrence rate and the impact of repair on quality of life (QoL). METHODS Patients were identified from a prospective database. A standardized questionnaire was used to assess symptoms and a barium swallow radiograph was performed to determine anatomy. A validated QoL measure, Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI) was also applied to all patients. RESULTS Of the 69 eligible patients, clinical follow-up was available for 54 patients (78.3%). Follow-up ranged from 72 to 185 (median: 114) months. Post-operative heartburn and dysphagia were significantly improved, with 45 patients (83%) reporting a good or excellent result. Contrast radiology in 35 patients (65%) revealed recurrence in 12 patients (34%). Fifty-four patients answered the GIQLI questionnaire. The mean GIQLI score was 117 (61-136). Patients with objectively documented anatomic recurrence had a QoL index of 92 (61-121) compared to an index of 122 (77-136, P < 0.01) in the non-recurrent hernia group. CONCLUSIONS At mean 114 months follow-up, laparoscopic repair of large hiatal hernias achieves effective and durable relief of symptoms, and most patients are satisfied with the outcome.", "PURPOSE Enhanced recovery pathways (ERP) decrease morbidity and duration of stay after colorectal surgery. There is little information about their role in complex procedures, such as esophagectomy. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of an ERP on duration of stay, complications, and readmissions after esophagectomy. METHODS Patients undergoing esophagectomy for cancer or high-grade dysplasia from June 2009 to December 2011 were identified from a prospectively maintained database. Beginning in June 2010, all patients were enrolled in a 7-day multidisciplinary ERP including written patient education with daily treatment plan, indications for intensive care admission, early structured mobilization, and diet and drain management. Short-term (30-day) outcomes were compared for patients undergoing esophagectomy pre- and post-pathway. Data are expressed as median values [interquartile range]. RESULTS We identified 106 patients; 47 underwent esophagectomy before ERP implementation and 59 after. Patients were similar with respect to age, gender, diagnosis, and operative time. Hospital stay was shorter in the ERP group (8 [7-17] vs 10 [9-17] days; P = .01). There were no differences in rates of complications (59% vs 62%) or readmissions (6% vs 5%). CONCLUSION Implementation of a multidisciplinary ERP for esophagectomy was associated with decreased duration of stay, without an increase in complications or readmissions.", "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) continues to grow in global prevalence and consumes an increasing amount of resources in the United States health care system. Overall rates of intervention for PAD have been rising steadily in recent years. Changing demographics, evolution of technologies, and an expanding database of outcomes studies are primary forces influencing clinical decision making in PAD. The management of PAD is multidisciplinary, involving primary care physicians and vascular specialists with varying expertise in diagnostic and treatment modalities. PAD represents a broad spectrum of disease from asymptomatic through severe limb ischemia. The Society for Vascular Surgery Lower Extremity Practice Guidelines committee reviewed the evidence supporting clinical care in the treatment of asymptomatic PAD and intermittent claudication (IC). The committee made specific practice recommendations using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system. There are limited Level I data available for many of the critical questions in the field, demonstrating the urgent need for comparative effectiveness research in PAD. Emphasis is placed on risk factor modification, medical therapies, and broader use of exercise programs to improve cardiovascular health and functional performance. Screening for PAD appears of unproven benefit at present. Revascularization for IC is an appropriate therapy for selected patients with disabling symptoms, after a careful risk-benefit analysis. Treatment should be individualized based on comorbid conditions, degree of functional impairment, and anatomic factors. Invasive treatments for IC should provide predictable functional improvements with reasonable durability. A minimum threshold of a >50% likelihood of sustained efficacy for at least 2 years is suggested as a benchmark. Anatomic patency (freedom from restenosis) is considered a prerequisite for sustained efficacy of revascularization in IC. Endovascular approaches are favored for most candidates with aortoiliac disease and for selected patients with femoropopliteal disease in whom anatomic durability is expected to meet this minimum threshold. Conversely, caution is warranted in the use of interventions for IC in anatomic settings where durability is limited (extensive calcification, small-caliber arteries, diffuse infrainguinal disease, poor runoff). Surgical bypass may be a preferred strategy in good-risk patients with these disease patterns or in those with prior endovascular failures. Common femoral artery disease should be treated surgically, and saphenous vein is the preferred conduit for infrainguinal bypass grafting. Patients who undergo invasive treatments for IC should be monitored regularly in a surveillance program to record subjective improvements, assess risk factors, optimize compliance with cardioprotective medications, and monitor hemodynamic and patency status.", "Sofosbuvir may be a potential option in the treatment of COVID-19 based on the similarity between the replication mechanisms of the HCV and the coronavirus. According the limited experimental evidences, it is hypothesized that sofosbuvir might be a potential option to improve care of patients with COVID-19 especially at the start of the disease and before invasion of the virus into the lung parenchymal cells. Efficacy and safety of sofosbuvir in treatment of COVID-19 may be considered in future clinical studies.", "Background: Crisis lines are a standard component of a public health approach to suicide prevention. Clinical aims include reducing individuals' crisis states, psychological distress, and risk of suicide. Efforts may also include enhancing access and facilitating connections to behavioral health care. This review examines models of crisis line services for demonstrated effectiveness. Methods: Literature searches of Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar were conducted from January 1, 1990, to May 7, 2018. Experts were contacted, and references were mined for additional studies. Eligible studies provided health- or utilization-related effectiveness outcome(s). Results were graded according to the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine and evaluated for risk of bias using the Effective Public Health Practice Project quality assessment tool for quantitative studies. Results: Thirty-three studies yielded effectiveness outcomes. In most cases findings regarding crisis calls vs. other modalities were presented. Evaluation approaches included user- and helper-reported data, silent monitoring, and analyses of administrative records. About half of studies reported immediate proximal outcomes (during the crisis service), and the remaining reported distal outcomes (up to four years post-contact). Most studies were rated at Oxford level four evidence and 80% were assessed at high risk of bias. Conclusions: High quality evidence demonstrating crisis line effectiveness is lacking. Moreover, most approaches to demonstrating impact only measured proximal outcomes. Research should focus on innovative strategies to assess proximal and distal outcomes, with a specific focus on behavioral health treatment engagement and future self-directed violence.", "Complications such as pseudoaneurysms (PA) related to cervicothoracic venous access can be devastating. In this article, we present two similar cases in which technological advances impacted diagnosis, treatment, and results. Both patients developed massive PA after deep venous puncture attempts. The first case occurred in 1993 and was diagnosed by a duplex scan that revealed a large PA originating from the right subclavian artery. The artery was approached by median sternotomy with supraclavicular extension. The PA originated from the thyrocervical trunk and was treated with simple ligation. The second case was in 2017. Angiotomography revealed a PA originating in the vertebral artery, which was treated with endovascular techniques, maintaining vessel patency. Both patients progressed satisfactorily, despite quite different approaches. Cervicothoracic vascular lesions represent a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge, where the risk of rupture is high. Technological advances have reduced the risks involved in management of vascular injuries with difficult surgical access.", "Paget-Schroetter syndrome (PSS) is a rare form of thoracic outlet syndrome caused by axillosubclavian vein thrombosis which typically presents in healthy young adults. Prompt therapy, traditionally by means of catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) prior to definitive surgery, can prevent the subsequent onset of postthrombotic syndrome (PTS) and considerable disability. As CDT is associated with major haemorrhage and high overall treatment cost, pharmacomechanical thrombectomy (PMT) seems to be an attractive alternative which combines pharmacological thrombolysis with mechanical clot disruption. The Trellis-8 peripheral infusion catheter is an example of such a treatment which provides topical thrombolysis in an isolated zone. We describe the use of the Trellis-8 PMT system in the successful management of three patients with PSS.", "The Pipeline embolization device (PED), a type of flow diverter, has become an appealing alternative treatment option for large or giant and wide-necked intracranial aneurysms. Carotid cavernous fistula (CCF) resulting from delayed aneurysmal rupture is a rare complication of PED placement with unknown pathophysiology. Here, we describe a case of CCF resulting from aneurysmal rupture following PED placement, and present the details of treatment by transvenous coil embolization. An 81-year-old woman was referred to our hospital for treatment of an 18.0 \u00d7 10.3 mm intracranial aneurysm located in the cavernous segment of the left internal carotid artery, noted during an examination of her diplopia. Endovascular treatment was conducted by positioning a single PED (4.75 \u00d7 25 mm) across the neck of the aneurysm. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged 8 days post procedure. On post-procedure day 10, her left oculomotor nerve palsy had worsened and she had developed left abducens nerve palsy, left exophthalmos, and left chemosis. Angiography demonstrated left direct CCF because of rupture of the aneurysm that had been treated with PED. Transvenous coil embolization was performed on post-procedure day 11 to treat the CCF, and complete resolution of the CCF and significant thrombus formation within the aneurysm sac were confirmed 11 days after the second procedure. Our angiographic results suggest that the aneurysmal rupture was caused by aneurysmal volume expansion associated with PED-induced thrombosis. Transvenous coil embolization for the treatment of CCF following PED placement constitutes a new challenge.", " Transanal minimally invasive surgery (TAMIS) has emerged as an alternative to transanal endoscopic microsurgery. We assessed the feasibility of TAMIS for lesions located in the mid rectum. METHODS From July 2010 to October 2011, 16 consecutive patients with rectal pathology underwent TAMIS. After a single-incision laparoscopic surgery port was introduced into the anal canal, pneumorectum was established with a laparoscopic device, followed by transanal excision with conventional laparoscopic instruments, including graspers, monopolar electrocautery, and needle drivers. Clinicopathological findings, surgical procedure results, and perioperative outcomes were determined prospectively. RESULTS Of the 16 patients, 11 had rectal cancers (3 T1 lesions and 8 after preoperative chemoradiotherapy), 4 had neuroendocrine tumors, and 1 had a mucocele. The median length of the lesions from anal verge was 7.5 cm (range 4-10 cm). All procedures were completed laparoscopically without conversion to conventional transanal approach. The median operating time was 86 min (range 33-160 min), and the median estimated blood loss was 15 ml (range 0-150 ml) with no patient requiring intraoperative transfusions. There was no surgical morbidity or mortality, but one patient died during follow-up due to synchronous advanced gastric cancer. The median postoperative hospital stay was 3 days (range 2-6 days). CONCLUSIONS TAMIS seems to be a feasible and safe treatment option for lesions located in the mid rectum.", "CONTEXT Planning for a severe influenza pandemic entails facing many substantive public health challenges, especially in the area of the distribution of insufficient supplies of materials and personnel. It is anticipated that rationing of health care resources will be required, thus demanding that choices be made about which individuals should receive potentially life-saving care when not all who can be saved can be served. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION Most proposed triage and allocation plans have used medical inclusion and exclusion criteria to reduce this gap, but there will still be many more patients than resources. Thus, the potential to arbitrarily exclude groups of people on non-medical grounds in order to reduce relative scarcity could offer an attractive option. Can societies make reasoned anticipatory decisions to keep certain people from receiving influenza treatment in order to maximize the availability of care for other, more favored groups? RESULTS In this paper, we argue that taking the fundamental moral equality of people seriously requires the inclusion of vulnerable, socially marginalized groups (such as illegal immigrants and incarcerated prisoners) in planning for a pandemic. While there may be a majoritarian justification for a priori discrimination against some groups of people on non-medical grounds, there are no morally defensible reasons to do so and many reasons not to engage in such behavior. CONCLUSIONS Pandemic planners should resist attempts to institute either unsanctioned or authorized discrimination in resource allocation. Because of their unique position in society, their ethical code and their essential role in confronting a pandemic, physicians can (and should) defend egalitarianism in the allocation of health care resources in such a public health crisis and advocate and act against such exclusion were it to occur.", "The evaluation and management of acute ischemic stroke has primarily relied on the use of conventional CT and MRI techniques as well as lumen imaging sequences such as CT angiography (CTA) and MR angiography (MRA). Several newer or less-established imaging modalities, including vessel wall MRI, transcranial Doppler ultrasonography, and 4D CTA and MRA, are being developed to complement conventional CT and MRI techniques. Vessel wall MRI provides high-resolution analysis of both extracranial and intracranial vasculature to help identify previously occult lesions or characteristics of lesions that may portend a worse natural history. Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography can be used in the acute setting as a minimally invasive way of identifying large vessel occlusions or monitoring the response to stroke treatment. It can also be used to assist in the workup for cryptogenic stroke or to diagnose a patent foramen ovale. Four-dimensional CTA and MRA provide a less invasive alternative to digital subtraction angiography to determine the extent of the clot burden and the degree of collateral blood flow in large vessel occlusions. Along with technological advances, these new imaging modalities are improving the diagnosis, workup, and management of acute ischemic stroke- roles that will continue to expand in the future.", "Collaborative research projects between chemists, biologists, and medical scientists have inevitably produced many useful drugs, biosensors, and medical instrumentation. Organic chemistry lies at the heart of drug discovery and development. The current range of organic synthetic methodologies allows for the construction of unlimited libraries of small organic molecules for drug screening. In translational research projects, we have focused on the discovery of lead compounds for three major diseases: Alzheimer's disease (AD), breast cancer, and viral infections. In the AD project, we have taken a rational\u2010design approach and synthesized a new class of tricyclic pyrone (TP) compounds that preserve memory and motor functions in amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilin\u20101 (PS1) mice. TPs could protect neuronal death through several possible mechanisms, including their ability to inhibit the formation of both intraneuronal and extracellular amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) aggregates, to increase cholesterol efflux, to restore axonal trafficking, and to enhance long\u2010term potentiation (LTP) and restored LTP following treatment with A\u03b2 oligomers. We have also synthesized a new class of gap\u2010junction enhancers, based on substituted quinolines, that possess potent inhibitory activities against breast\u2010cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Although various antiviral drugs are available, the emergence of viral resistance to existing antiviral drugs and various understudied viral infections, such as norovirus and rotavirus, emphasizes the demand for the development of new antiviral agents against such infections and others. Our laboratories have undertaken these projects for the discovery of new antiviral inhibitors. The discussion of these aforementioned projects may shed light on the future development of drug candidates in the fields of AD, cancer, and viral infections.", "OBJECTIVE To evaluate the safety and feasibility of total retroperitoneal laparoscopic nephroureterectomy with urinary-bladder junction resection for a tuberculous non-functional kidney. MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 27 individuals diagnosed with unilateral non-functional kidney secondary to tuberculosis were treated between June 2011 and June 2015. All patients had normal renal function on the contralateral side and underwent the standard four-drug anti-tuberculosis treatment for at least four weeks before surgery. Total retroperitoneal laparoscopic nephroureterectomy was performed in all patients, and the urinary-bladder junction of distal ureter was managed using different auto-suture techniques. RESULTS Nineteen male and 8 female patients with an average age of 47.3 years (range, 36-64 years) underwent surgery. All the operations were successfully performed without conversion. The median operative time was 109.3 min (range, 75-138 min), the median blood loss was 157.5 mL (range, 70-250 mL), and the median hospitalization time was 3.7 days (range, 3-6 days). No serious perioperative complications occurred. Anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy was prescribed to all patients, with the entire course of treatment lasting six months. No recurrence of tuberculosis of the bladder or the contralateral kidney was observed during the median follow-up period of 26.7 months (range, 6-54 months). CONCLUSION Retroperitoneal laparoscopic nephroureterectomy with urinary-bladder junction resection is a safe and feasible approach for the treatment of tuberculous non-functional kidneys.", " AND PURPOSE In a substudy of the International Carotid Stenting Study (ICSS), more patients had new ischemic brain lesions on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after stenting (CAS) than after endarterectomy (CEA). In the present analysis, we compared characteristics of diffusion-weighted MRI lesions. METHODS Number, individual and total volumes, and location of new diffusion-weighted MRI lesions were compared in patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis randomized to CAS (n=124) or CEA (n=107) in the ICSS-MRI substudy. RESULTS CAS patients had higher lesion numbers than CEA patients (1 lesion, 15% vs 8%; 2-5 lesions, 19% vs 5%; >5 lesions, 16% vs 4%). The overall risk ratio for the expected lesion count with CAS versus CEA was 8.8 (95% confidence interval, 4.4-17.5; P<0.0001) and significantly increased among patients with lower blood pressure at randomization, diabetes mellitus, stroke as the qualifying event, left-side stenosis, and if patients were treated at centers routinely using filter-type protection devices during CAS. Individual lesions were smaller in the CAS group than in the CEA group (P<0.0001). Total lesion volume per patient did not differ significantly. Lesions in the CAS group were more likely to occur in cortical areas and subjacent white matter supplied by leptomeningeal arteries than lesions in the CEA group (odds ratio, 4.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.7-10.2; P=0.002). CONCLUSIONS Compared with patients undergoing CEA, patients treated with CAS had higher numbers of periprocedural ischemic brain lesions, and lesions were smaller and more likely to occur in cortical areas and subjacent white matter. These findings may reflect differences in underlying mechanisms of cerebral ischemia.", "Lung cancer care is rapidly changing with advances in genomic testing, the development of next-generation targeted kinase inhibitors, and the continued broad study of immunotherapy in new settings and potential combinations. The International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer and the Journal of Thoracic Oncology publish this annual update to help readers keep pace with these important developments. Experts in thoracic cancer and care provide focused updates across multiple areas, including prevention and early detection, molecular diagnostics, pathology and staging, surgery, adjuvant therapy, radiotherapy, molecular targeted therapy, and immunotherapy for NSCLC, SCLC, and mesothelioma. Quality and value of care and perspectives on the future of lung cancer research and treatment have also been included in this concise review.", "OBJECTIVE To present outcomes of a randomized, patient-blinded controlled trial on Pfannenstiel laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) vs conventional multiport laparoscopic live donor nephrectomy. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients presenting as left kidney donors between January 2009 and November 2011 were randomized to LESS donor nephrectomy (LESS-DN: n = 15) or conventional laparoscopic donor nephrectomy (LDN: n = 14). Patients were blinded to the surgical approach preoperatively and attempts to continue patient blinding postoperatively were made by applying dressings consistent with multiple conventional laparoscopic incisions for all patients. De-identified data related to the operation, peri-operative course and postoperative follow-up were prospectively collected and compared between the two groups with an intention-to-treat analysis. RESULTS There were no significant differences between the groups when comparing operating time, estimated blood loss (EBL), i.v. fluid administration, renal allograft warm ischaemia time (WIT), length of hospital stay (LOS) and total inpatient analgesic requirements. Quantitative pain assessment was not significantly different on postoperative day (POD) #0, however, it was significantly lower in the LESS-DN group, beginning on POD #1 (P < 0.05). The changes in haematocrit and serum creatinine in the two groups were not significantly different, and there were no blood transfusions in either group, nor was there a decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate to <60 mL/min per 1.73 m\u00b2 of body surface area in any patients. Two patients in the LESS-DN group were converted to conventional LDN, both because of failure to progress effectively. All allografts were functional at the time of transplantation and revascularization, with no cases of hyperacute rejection. CONCLUSIONS Peri-operative variables including EBL, WIT and LOS were equivalent when comparing Pfannenstiel LESS-DN with conventional LDN. Patient-reported visual analogue pain scale scores were significantly lower in the LESS-DN group beginning on the first postoperative day.", "The treatment of critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) faces compelling challenges. In this issue, we'd like to share our first-line treatment experience in treating COVID-19. Hemodynamics need be closely monitored and different types of shock should be distinguished. Vasoconstrictor drugs should be used rationally and alerting of complications is of the same importance. The risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) needs to be assessed, and effective prevention should be carried out for high-risk patients. It is necessary to consider the possibility of pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) in patients with sudden onset of oxygenation deterioration, respiratory distress, reduced blood pressure. However, comprehensive analysis of disease state should be taken into the interpretation of abnormally elevated D-Dimer. Nutritional support is the basis of treatment. It's important to establish individual therapy regimens and to evaluate, monitor and adjust dynamically. Under the current epidemic situation, convalescent plasma can only be used empirically, indications need to be strictly screened, the blood transfusion process should be closely monitored and the curative effect should be dynamically evaluated.", " Although the exact aetiology of necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) remains unknown, research suggests that it is multifactorial; suspected pathophysiological mechanisms include immaturity, intestinal ischaemia, disruption of intestinal mucosal integrity, formula feeding, hyperosmolar load to the intestine, infection and bacterial translocation. Various antibiotic regimens have been widely used in the treatment of NEC. OBJECTIVES To compare the efficacy of different antibiotic regimens on mortality and the need for surgery in neonates with NEC. SEARCH METHODS Searches were made of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2012), Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials, MEDLINE (1966 to February 2012), EMBASE (1980 to February 2012) and CINAHL (1982 to February 2012). SELECTION CRITERIA All randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials where antibiotic regimens were used for treatment of NEC. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Eligibility of studies for inclusion was assessed independently by each review author. The criteria and standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group were used to assess the methodological quality of the included trials. MAIN RESULTS Two trials met the inclusion criteria. Faix 1988 randomised 42 premature infants with radiological diagnosis of NEC. Infants were randomised to receive either intravenous ampicillin and gentamicin or ampicillin, gentamicin and clindamycin. Hansen 1980 randomised 20 infants with NEC to receive intravenous ampicillin and gentamicin with or without enteral gentamicin.In the study by Faix 1988, there were no statistical differences in mortality (RR 1.10; 95% CI 0.32 to 3.83) or bowel perforation (RR 2.20; 95% CI 0.45 to 10.74) between the two groups although there was a trend towards higher rate of strictures in the group that received clindamycin (RR 7.20; 95% CI 0.97 to 53.36).The Hansen 1980 study showed no statistically significant difference in death, bowel perforation or development of strictures. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS There was insufficient evidence to recommend a particular antibiotic regimen for the treatment of NEC. There were concerns about adverse effects following the usage of clindamycin, related to the development of strictures. To address this issue a large randomised controlled trial needs to be performed.", "Oseltamivir resistance during treatment of H7N9 infection.", " The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical differences in wound complications after total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) between a cohort of patients that received a compression wrap protocol and a historical control group treated with cast immobilization. METHODS Patient charts and postoperative wound pictures were reviewed for 42 patients who underwent a compression wrap protocol and 50 patients who underwent circumferential casting after primary TAA from 2008 to 2013. A blinded reviewer graded each wound using a novel postoperative wound classification system, and recorded whether the wound was completely healed by or after 3 months. A second blinded review was performed to determine intraobserver reliability. Mean patient age was 55 years (range, 24-80) and all patients had at least 6-month follow-up. RESULTS There were significantly more total wound complications (P = .02) and mild wound complications (P = .02) in the casted group compared to the compression wrap group. There were no significant differences in the number of moderate and severe complications between each group. A significantly higher proportion of TAA incisions took longer than 3 months to heal in the casted group (P = .02). CONCLUSIONS Based on our clinical experience with postoperative wound care after TAA, use of a compression wrap protocol was safe and effective at reducing wound-related complications, and well tolerated by patients. Further prospective, randomized clinical trials are warranted to evaluate the utility and cost-effectiveness of a compression wrap protocol after TAA.", "Evidence has lately emerged regarding an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 with worse prognosis in patients with obesity, especially among the young. Weight excess is a well-established respiratory disease risk factor, and the newly reported correlation is therefore unsurprising. The underlying pathophysiology is likely multi-stranded, ranging from complement system hyperactivation, increased Interleukin-6 secretion, chronic inflammation, presence of comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension, and a possible local, detrimental effect within the lung. Further understanding the link between obesity and SARS-CoV-2 is crucial, as this could aid proper tailoring of immunomodulatory treatments, together with improving stratification among those possibly requiring critical care.

All rights reserved.", "To gain entry into the target cell, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV) uses its spike (S) protein S2 subunit to fuse with the plasma or endosomal membrane. Previous work identified a peptide derived from the heptad repeat (HR) 2 domain in S2 subunit, HR2P, which potently blocked MERS-CoV S protein\u2013mediated membrane fusion. Here, we tested an HR2P analogue with improved pharmaceutical property, HR2P-M2, for its inhibitory activity against MERS-CoV infection in vitro and in vivo. HR2P-M2 was highly effective in inhibiting MERS-CoV S protein\u2013mediated cell-cell fusion and infection by pseudoviruses expressing MERS-CoV S protein with or without mutation in the HR1 region. It interacted with the HR1 peptide to form stable \u03b1-helical complex and blocked six-helix bundle formation between the HR1 and HR2 domains in the viral S protein. Intranasally administered HR2P-M2 effectively protected adenovirus serotype-5\u2013human dipeptidyl peptidase 4\u2013transduced mice from infection by MERS-CoV strains with or without mutations in the HR1 region of S protein, with >1000-fold reduction of viral titers in lung, and the protection was enhanced by combining HR2P-M2 with interferon \u03b2. These results indicate that this combination regimen merits further development to prevent MERS in high-risk populations, including healthcare workers and patient family members, and to treat MERS-CoV\u2013infected patients.", "OPINION STATEMENT The need to develop highly qualified, multidisciplinary critical limb ischemia (CLI) programs has gained significant momentum. Due to the systemic nature of the disease, patients with CLI are inherently medically complex and often present with multiple comorbidities. Successful care for these patients depends on community screening, early referral, accurate diagnosis, risk stratification, risk factor modification, invasive and non-invasive treatment strategies, and appropriate surveillance. Patients with CLI are often treated by multiple subspecialists-often lacking a unified team which could lead to inefficiencies and redundancy. Establishing an effective critical limb ischemia program relies on the joint efforts of multiple physician specialists, nurses, technicians, wound care specialists, researchers, and administrators who together form an integrated network that is easily accessible to the patient. This article will focus on the various modalities needed to build an advanced critical limb ischemia program, while addressing the challenges facing the medical community in caring for this population.", "UNLABELLED STING has emerged in recent years as a key player in orchestrating innate immune responses to cytosolic DNA and RNA derived from pathogens. However, the regulation of STING still remains poorly defined. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism of the regulation of STING expression in relation to the RIG-I pathway. Our data show that signaling through RIG-I induces STING expression at both the transcriptional and protein levels in various cell types. STING induction by the RIG-I agonist 5'triphosphorylated RNA (5'pppRNA) was recognized to be a delayed event resulting from an autocrine/paracrine mechanism. Indeed, cotreatment with tumor necrosis factor alpha and type I/II interferon was found to have a synergistic effect on the regulation of STING expression and could be potently decreased by impairing NF-\u03baB and/or STAT1/2 signaling. STING induction significantly contributed to sustainment of the immune signaling cascade following 5'pppRNA treatment. Physiologically, this cross talk between the RNA- and DNA-sensing pathways allowed 5'pppRNA to efficiently block infection by herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) both in vitro and in vivo in a STING-dependent fashion. These observations demonstrate that STING induction by RIG-I signaling through the NF-\u03baB and STAT1/2 cascades is essential for RIG-I agonist-mediated HSV-1 restriction. IMPORTANCE The innate immune system represents the first line of defense against invading pathogens. The dysregulation of this system can result in failure to combat pathogens, inflammation, and autoimmune diseases. Thus, precise regulation at each level of the innate immune system is crucial. Recently, a number of studies have established STING to be a central molecule in the innate immune response to cytosolic DNA and RNA derived from pathogens. Here, we describe the regulation of STING via RIG-I-mediated innate immune sensing. We found that STING is synergistically induced via proinflammatory and antiviral cytokine cascades. In addition, we show that in vivo protection against herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) by a RIG-I agonist required STING. Our study provides new insights into the cross talk between DNA and RNA pathogen-sensing systems via the control of STING.", "OBJECTIVES The purpose of our study was to distinguish the different components of a brain arteriovenous malformation (bAVM) on 3D rotational angiography (3D-RA) using a semi-automated segmentation algorithm. MATERIALS AND METHODS Data from 3D-RA of 15 patients (8 males, 7 females; 14 supratentorial bAVMs, 1 infratentorial) were used to test the algorithm. Segmentation was performed in two steps: (1) nidus segmentation from propagation (vertical then horizontal) of tagging on the reference slice (i.e., the slice on which the nidus had the biggest surface); (2) contiguity propagation (based on density and variance) from tagging of arteries and veins distant from the nidus. Segmentation quality was evaluated by comparison with six frame/s DSA by two independent reviewers. Analysis of supraselective microcatheterisation was performed to dispel discrepancy. RESULTS Mean duration for bAVM segmentation was 64 \u00b1 26 min. Quality of segmentation was evaluated as good or fair in 93% of cases. Segmentation had better results than six frame/s DSA for the depiction of a focal ectasia on the main draining vein and for the evaluation of the venous drainage pattern. CONCLUSION This segmentation algorithm is a promising tool that may help improve the understanding of bAVM angio-architecture, especially the venous drainage. KEY POINTS \u2022 The segmentation algorithm allows for the distinction of the AVM's components \u2022 This algorithm helps to see the venous drainage of bAVMs more precisely \u2022 This algorithm may help to reduce the treatment-related complication rate.", "OBJECTIVE To report surgical complications, occurrence of post-obliteration colic, long term outcome, and return to previous function for horses treated with prosthetic mesh obliteration of the nephrosplenic space. STUDY DESIGN Retrospective study. ANIMALS Horses (n = 26) having nephrosplenic space obliteration using prosthetic mesh. METHODS Horses undergoing mesh obliteration between January 2006 and May 2013 were included. A Proxplast\u2122 mesh was secured to the nephrosplenic space with titanium helical coils in standing horses using laparoscopic technique. Perioperative data were obtained from the medical record and by telephone followup. Tests of proportion were used to compare the study population to the hospital colic population. Occurrence of colic within 1 year of obliteration was compared between horses where the diagnosis was confirmed at laparotomy and those diagnosed by abdominal palpation per rectum using a Fisher's exact test. RESULTS All 26 horses undergoing mesh obliteration during the study period survived to discharge. Long term followup was available for 25 horses, with 23 returning to their previous level of function, and 21 alive at the time of followup. Cause of death was not associated with the surgical procedure in any case. Geldings and Warmbloods were overrepresented compared to the hospital colic population. Ten horses (38%) demonstrated colic after mesh obliteration. All 10 horses were examined by a veterinarian and none were diagnosed with recurrence of nephrosplenic entrapment. CONCLUSION Mesh obliteration of the nephrosplenic space is an effective alternative to suture closure for preventing nephrosplenic entrapment of the large colon in horses. No complications related to mesh obliteration were reported in our study population.", " Adult diaphragmatic hernia is a rare case and usually present with various clinical manifestations. Surgery can be done by thoracic and abdominal approaches. In emergency cases, mostly performed by abdominal approach. The use of mesh to close the defect is currently emerging as a viable option. PRESENTATION OF CASE We report a case of 70-year-old woman with complaints of shortness of breath and abdominal pain. The patient had a history of laparoscopic surgery with the installation of an anti-adhesive mesh for diaphragmatic hernia seven months before admission. Chest X-ray and Computed Tomography (CT) scan found recurrence of diaphragmatic hernia. The patient then received laparotomy showing diaphragmatic hernia with contents in the form of transverse colon, ileum, gastric and omentum. The self-attached mesh was placed on the supra-diaphragm with abdominal approach. The patient was hospitalised four days after surgery. At two weeks and six months follow-up, no complaints were found. CT scan and chest X-ray were within normal limits. DISCUSSION We did a modified technique in managing the recurrence and adhesion of the diaphragmatic hernia using the hernia mesh attached onto the superior side of the diaphragm to minimise the complications and recurrences. CONCLUSIONS Transabdominal supradiaphragmatic self-attached mesh for recurrent diaphragmatic hernia can be considered to be an alternative treatment for recurrent diaphragmatic hernia in an emergency setting because this procedure is relatively easier, safer, causes fewer postoperative complications, and can prevent recurrence.", "OBJECTIVES To examine one health system's response to the essential care of its hip fracture population during the COVID-19 pandemic and report on its effect on patient outcomes. DESIGN Prospective cohort study SETTING:: Seven musculoskeletal care centers with New York City and Long Island. PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS 138 recent and 115 historical hip fracture patients. INTERVENTION Patients with hip fractures occurring between February 1, 2020 and April 15, 2020 or between February 1, 2019 and April 15, 2019 were prospectively enrolled in an orthopedic trauma registry and chart reviewed for demographic and hospital quality measures. Patients with recent hip fractures were identified as COVID positive (C+), COVID suspected (Cs) or COVID negative (C-). MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS Hospital quality measures, inpatient complications and mortality rates. RESULTS Seventeen (12.2%) patients were confirmed C+ by testing and another 14 (10.1%) were suspected (Cs) of having had the virus but were never tested. The C+ cohort, when compared to Cs and C- cohorts, had: an increased mortality rate (35.3% vs 7.1% vs 0.9%), increased length of hospital stay, a greater major complication rate and a greater incidence of ventilator need postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 had a devastating effect on the care of hip fracture patients during the pandemic. Although practice patterns generally remained unchanged, treating physicians need to understand the increased morbidity and mortality in hip fracture patients complicated by COVID-19. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Prognostic Level III. See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of Levels of Evidence.", "OBJECTIVES Pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA) is an effective treatment for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), but postoperative residual hypertension leads to in-hospital mortality. Inhaled epoprostenol sodium (PGI2) and NO are administered for pulmonary hypertension after cardiothoracic surgery. This prospective study provides the first comparative evaluation of the effects of inhaled PGI2 and NO on pulmonary hemodynamics, systemic hemodynamics, and gas exchange in patients developing residual pulmonary hypertension after PEA. METHODS Thirteen patients were randomized to receive either NO (n = 6) or PGI2 (n = 7) inhalation when pulmonary hypertension persisted after weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass. Hemodynamic and respiratory variables were measured before inhalation of the agent (T0); 30 min (T1), 3 h (T2), and 6 h after inhalation (T3); and the next morning (T4). The NO dose was started at 20 ppm and gradually tapered until extubation, and PGI2 was administered at a dose of 10 ng kg-1 min-1. RESULTS In both groups, mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) significantly decreased over time until T4 (mean PAP: p < 0.0001; PVR: p = 0.003), while mean systemic arterial blood pressure significantly increased (p = 0.028). There were no significant between-group differences in patient characteristics, cardiac index, left atrial pressure, or ratio of arterial oxygen tension to fraction of inspired oxygen. There were no in-hospital deaths. CONCLUSIONS Both inhaled PGI2 and NO significantly reduced PAP and PVR without adverse effects on systemic hemodynamics in patients who developed residual pulmonary hypertension after PEA. Inhaled PGI2 can be offered as alternative treatment option for residual pulmonary hypertension.", "We report a case of appendiceal mucinous cystadenoma that was successfully diagnosed preoperatively and treated by laparoscopic resection. We could find volcano sign on colonoscopy and cystic lesion without any nodules at the appendix on computed tomography (CT). Without any malignant factors in preoperative examinations, we performed laparoscopic appendectomy including the cecal wall. We could avoid performing excessive operation for cystadenoma with accurate preoperative diagnosis and intraoperative finding and pathological diagnosis during surgery. Appendiceal mucocele is a rare disease that is divided into 3 pathological types: hyperplasia, cystadenoma, and cystadenocarcinoma. The surgical approaches for it remain controversial and oversurgery is sometimes done for benign tumor, because preoperative diagnosis is difficult and rupturing an appendiceal tumor results in dissemination. Based on our study, volcano sign on colonoscopy and CT findings were important for the preoperative diagnosis of appendiceal mucocele. Furthermore, we think that laparoscopic resection will become a surgical option for the treatment of appendiceal mucocele.", "Background In the absence of any approved treatment or vaccine against novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus -2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) are the cornerstone to prevent the disease, especially in a populous country like India. Objectives To understand the effectiveness of NPIs reported in the contemporary literatures describing prediction models for prevention of the ongoing pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 specifically in Indian population. Methods Original research articles in English obtained through keyword search in PubMed, WHO Global Database for COVID19, and pre-print servers were included in the review. Thematic synthesis of extracted data from articles were done. Results Twenty-four articles were found eligible for the review - four published articles and twenty pre-print articles. Compartmental model was found to be the most commonly used mathematical model; along with exponential, time varying, neural network and cluster kinetic models. Social distancing, specifically lockdown, was the most commonly modelled intervention strategy. Additionally, contact tracing using smartphone application, international travel restriction, increasing hospital/ICU beds, changes in testing strategy were also dealt with. Social distancing along with increasing testing seemed to be effective in delaying the peak of the epidemic and reducing the peak prevalence. Conclusion Although there is mathematical rationality behind implementation of social distancing measures including lockdown, this study also emphasised the importance of other associated measures like increasing tests and increasing the number of hospital and ICU beds. The later components are particularly important during the social mixing period to be observed after lifting of lockdown.", " It is generally assumed by practitioners and guideline authors that combined modalities (methods of treatment) are more effective than single modalities in preventing venous thromboembolism (VTE), defined as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), or both. This is an update of the review first published in 2008. OBJECTIVES The aim of this review was to assess the efficacy of combined intermittent pneumatic leg compression (IPC) and pharmacological prophylaxis versus single modalities in preventing venous thromboembolism. SEARCH METHODS For this update the Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist (CIS) searched the Specialised Register (May 2016). In addition the CIS searched the Cochrane Register of Studies (CENTRAL (2016, Issue 4)). Clinical trials databases were searched for details of ongoing or unpublished studies. SELECTION CRITERIA Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or controlled clinical trials (CCTs) of combined IPC and pharmacological interventions used to prevent VTE. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS We independently selected trials and extracted data. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. We performed fixed-effect model meta-analyses with odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used a random-effects model when there was heterogeneity. MAIN RESULTS We included a total of 22 trials (9137 participants) of which 15 were randomized trials (7762 participants). The overall risk of bias was mostly unclear or high due to selection and performance bias. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence and this was downgraded from high to moderate or very low due to the risk of bias, imprecision or indirectness.The rate of PE in the studies comparing IPC alone with combined IPC and pharmacological prophylaxis was low, underpowering the analyses. The incidence of symptomatic PE was 0.79% with IPC, but ranged between 0.1 to 1% with combined IPC and pharmacological prophylaxis (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.34; 12 studies, 3017 participants, moderate quality evidence). The incidence of DVT was 4.10% in the IPC group and 2.19% in the combined group showing a reduced incidence of DVT in favour of the combined group (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.82; 11 studies, 2934 participants, moderate quality evidence). The addition of an anticoagulant to IPC, however, increased the risk of any bleeding compared to IPC alone; 0.66% (7/1053) in the IPC group and 4.0% (44/1102) in the combined group (OR 5.04, 95% CI 2.36 to 10.77; 7 studies, 2155 participants, moderate quality evidence). Major bleeding followed a similar pattern; 0.1% (1/1053) in the IPC group to 1.5% (17/1102) in the combined group (OR 6.81, 95% CI 1.99 to 23.28; 7 studies, 2155 participants, moderate quality evidence).We detected no difference between the type of surgery subgroups such as orthopedic and non-orthopedic participants for DVT incidence (P = 0.16). Tests for differences between type of surgery subgroups were not possible for PE incidence.Compared with pharmacological prophylaxis alone, the use of combined IPC and pharmacological prophylaxis modalities reduced the incidence of symptomatic PE from 2.92% to 1.20% (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.64; 10 studies, 3544 participants, moderate quality evidence). The incidence of DVT was 6.2% in the pharmacological prophylaxis group and 2.9% in the combined group showing no difference between the combined and pharmacological prophylaxis groups (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.03; 11 studies, 2866 participants, moderate quality evidence). Increased bleeding side effects were not observed for IPC when it was added to anticoagulation (bleeding: OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.30 to 2.14, very low quality evidence; major bleeding: OR 1.21, 95% CI 0.35 to 4.18, very low quality evidence, 3 studies, 244 participants).No difference was detected between the type of surgery subgroups for PE incidence (P = 0.68) or for DVT incidence (P = 0.10). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Moderate quality evidence suggests that combining IPC and pharmacological prophylaxis, compared with IPC or pharmacological prophylaxis alone, decreases the incidence of DVT when compared to compression, and incidence of PE when compared to anticoagulation. Moderate quality evidence suggests that there is no difference between combined and single modalities in the incidence of PE when compared with compression alone and DVT when compared with anticoagulation alone. The quality of evidence for PE or DVT was downgraded to moderate due to imprecision or risk of bias in study methodology, highlighting the need for further research. Moderate quality evidence suggests the addition of pharmacological prophylaxis to IPC, increased the risk of bleeding compared to IPC alone, a side effect not observed for IPC when added to pharmacological prophylaxis (very low quality evidence), as expected for a physical method of thromboprophylaxis. The quality of evidence for bleeding was downgraded to moderate due to indirectness or very low due to risk of bias in study methodology, indirectness and imprecision highlighting the need for further research. Nevertheless, the results of the current review agree with current guideline recommendations, which support the use of combined modalities in hospitalised patients (limited to those with trauma or undergoing surgery) at risk of developing VTE. More studies on the role of combined modalities in VTE prevention are needed.", "OBJECTIVES Open abdomen (OA) treatment is sometimes necessary after surgery for aortic aneurysm (AA), to prevent or treat abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS). A multicentre study evaluating vacuum-assisted wound closure (100-150 mmHg) and mesh-mediated fascial traction (VAWCM) was performed. METHODS All patients treated with OA after AA repair (2006-2009) were prospectively registered at four centres; those treated <5 days were excluded. All surviving patients underwent a 1-year follow-up, including computed tomography (CT) examination. RESULTS Among 1041 patients treated with open or endovascular repair of AA, 28 (2.9%) had OA treatment with VAWCM; another two had VAWCM after hybrid operations for thoraco-abdominal AA. Eighteen (60%) were operated on for rupture and 12 (40%) electively. Eight had suprarenal or thoraco-abdominal aneurysms. Eight (27%) died within 30 days, none due to OA-related complications. Four died before abdominal closure; primary delayed fascial closure was achieved in all survivors. One-year mortality was 50%. Ten (33%) had bowel ischaemia requiring bowel resection. Late potential OA-related infectious complications occurred in five (17%), all of whom first developed intestinal ischaemia: entero-atmospheric fistulae (two), graft infections (two), aorto-enteric fistula (one). One year follow-up with clinical evaluation and CT showed no signs of graft infection. Incisional hernias occurred in 9 of 15 patients (60%); only three were symptomatic. CONCLUSION VAWCM provided high fascial closure rate after AA repair and long-term OA treatment. Infectious complications occur after intestinal ischaemia and prolonged OA treatment, and are often fatal. The poor prognosis among patients needing OA after AA surgery may be improved by using VAWCM, permitting earlier closure.", " Obesity is a major health concern in the Middle East and worldwide. It is among the leading causes of morbidity, mortality, health care utilization, and costs. With bariatric surgery proving to be a more effective treatment option for overweight and obesity, the need for systematic assessment of different procedures and their outcomes becomes necessary. These procedures have not yet been described in detail in our region. OBJECTIVE We aim to undertake a prospective study evaluating and comparing several surgical bariatric procedures in an Iranian population of morbid obese patients presenting to a specialized bariatric center. METHODS In order to facilitate and accelerate understanding of obesity and its complications, the Tehran Obesity Treatment Study (TOTS) was planned and developed. This study is a longitudinal prospective cohort study in consecutive patients undergoing bariatric surgery. TOTS investigators use standardized definitions, high-fidelity data collection system, and validated instruments to gather data preoperatively, at the time of surgery, postoperatively, and in longer-term follow-up. RESULTS This study has recruited 1050 participants as of September 2015 and is ongoing. CONCLUSIONS This study will ensure creation of high-level evidence to enable clinicians to make meaningful evidence-based decisions for patient evaluation, selection for surgery, and follow-up care.", " Catheter-related thrombotic complications(TCs) can occur during the long term use of a chronic dialysis catheter (CDC), including fibrin sheath (FS), mural thrombosis (MT), venous thrombosis (VT), and intraluminal clots (IC), which has not been reported with MRI. The aim of our study was to evaluate the determination of catheter tip position (TP) and resolution of TCs in patients with transjugular CDC scheduled into the superior vena cava using high resolution magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (HR-MRCP) and T2-weighted imaging (HR-T2WI). METHODS The study protocol was approved by the local Research Ethics Committee. Informed consent was obtained from all patients. In total, 41 consecutively enrolled transjugular CDC patients with suspected catheter dysfunction were scanned with HRMRCP and HR-T2WI. The distance from the top to the tip of the catheter and the presence and nature of catheter TCs were assessed by 2 experienced radiologists. Chest x-ray was taken within 1 to 2 days and CDC was withdrawn within 3 to 10 days from those patients with TCs identified by HR-MRI. RESULTS A total of 38 subjects successfully underwent HR-MRI, including 13 normal and 25 with TCs (fibrin sheath [FS]: n = 21, mural thrombosis [MT]: n = 7, venous thrombosis [VT]: n = 3, intraluminal clots [IC]: n = 4). There was no significant difference between HR-MRCP and chest x-ray in catheter TP determination (P = .124). Normal catheter appeared as \"double eyes\" on HR-T2WI and \"double tracks\" on HR-MRCP. TCs appeared as follows: FS displayed as a \"thin ring\" (<1mm) around the catheter, MT as patchy hyperintensity and VT as a \"thick ring\" (>5mm) on HR-T2WI. Unilateral IC appeared as a \"single eye\" on HR-T2WI and a \"single track\" on HR-MRCP (n = 3). Bilateral IC appeared as neither \"eye\" nor \"track\" (n = 1). Catheter withdrawal confirmed FS (n = 16), MT (n = 6), VT (n = 1), and IC (n = 4). CONCLUSION HR-MRCP and HR-T2WI are promising methods for visualizing TP and TCs in CDC patients, and are helpful in adjusting the treatment plan and avoiding the risk of pulmonary embolism.", " Venous thromboembolism is a common, potentially avoidable cause of death and morbidity in patients in hospital, including those with stroke. In surgical patients, intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) reduces the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), but no reliable evidence exists about its effectiveness in patients who have had a stroke. We assessed the effectiveness of IPC to reduce the risk of DVT in patients who have had a stroke. METHODS The CLOTS 3 trial is a multicentre parallel group randomised trial assessing IPC in immobile patients (ie, who cannot walk to the toilet without the help of another person) with acute stroke. We enrolled patients from day 0 to day 3 of admission and allocated them via a central randomisation system (ratio 1:1) to receive either IPC or no IPC. A technician who was masked to treatment allocation did a compression duplex ultrasound (CDU) of both legs at 7-10 days and, wherever practical, at 25-30 days after enrolment. Caregivers and patients were not masked to treatment assignment. Patients were followed up for 6 months to determine survival and later symptomatic venous thromboembolism. The primary outcome was a DVT in the proximal veins detected on a screening CDU or any symptomatic DVT in the proximal veins, confirmed on imaging, within 30 days of randomisation. Patients were analysed according to their treatment allocation. TRIAL REGISTRATION ISRCTN93529999. FINDINGS Between Dec 8, 2008, and Sept 6, 2012, 2876 patients were enrolled in 94 centres in the UK. The included patients were broadly representative of immobile stroke patients admitted to hospital and had a median age of 76 years (IQR 67-84). The primary outcome occurred in 122 (8\u00b75%) of 1438 patients allocated IPC and 174 (12\u00b71%) of 1438 patients allocated no IPC; an absolute reduction in risk of 3\u00b76% (95% CI 1\u00b74-5\u00b78). Excluding the 323 patients who died before any primary outcome and 41 without any screening CDU, the adjusted OR for the comparison of 122 of 1267 patients vs 174 of 1245 patients was 0\u00b765 (95% CI 0\u00b751-0\u00b784; p=0\u00b7001). Deaths in the treatment period occurred in 156 (11%) patients allocated IPC and 189 (13%) patients allocated no IPC died within the 30 days of treatment period (p=0\u00b7057); skin breaks on the legs were reported in 44 (3%) patients allocated IPC and in 20 (1%) patients allocated no IPC (p=0\u00b7002); falls with injury were reported in 33 (2%) patients in the IPC group and in 24 (2%) patients in the no-IPC group (p=0\u00b7221). INTERPRETATION IPC is an effective method of reducing the risk of DVT and possibly improving survival in a wide variety of patients who are immobile after stroke.

Here, we specifically analyzed kidney functions in COVID-19 patients and their relations to mortality. Methods: In this multi-centered, retrospective, observational study, we included 193 adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from 2 hospitals in Wuhan, 1 hospital in Huangshi (Hubei province, 83 km from Wuhan) and 1 hospital in Chongqing (754 km from Wuhan). Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected, including data regarding to kidney functions. Data were compared among three groups: non-severe COVID-19 patients (128), severe COVID-19 patients (65) and a control group of other pneumonia (28). For the data from computed tomographic (CT) scans, we also included a control group of healthy subjects (110 cases, without abnormalities in the lung and without kidney diseases). The primary outcome was a common presence of kidney dysfunctions in COVID-19 patients and the occurrence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in a fraction of COVID-19 patients. Secondary outcomes included a survival analysis of COVID-19 patients in conditions of AKI or comorbid chronic illnesses. Findings: We included 193 COVID-19 patients (128 non-severe, 65 severe (including 32 non-survivors), between January 6th and February 21th,2020; the final date of follow-up was March 4th, 2020) and 28 patients of other pneumonia (15 of viral pneumonia, 13 of mycoplasma pneumonia) before the COVID-19 outbreak. On hospital admission, a remarkable fraction of patients had signs of kidney dysfunctions, including 59% with proteinuria, 44% with hematuria, 14% with increased levels of blood urea nitrogen, and 10% with increased levels of serum creatinine, although mild but worse than that in cases with other pneumonia. While these kidney dysfunctions might not be readily diagnosed as AKI at admission, over the progress during hospitalization they could be gradually worsened and diagnosed as AKI. A univariate Cox regression analysis showed that proteinuria, hematuria, and elevated levels of blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, uric acid as well as D-dimer were significantly associated with the death of COVID-19 patients respectively. Importantly, the Cox regression analysis also suggested that COVID-19 patients that developed AKI had a ~5.3-times mortality risk of those without AKI, much higher than that of comorbid chronic illnesses (~1.5 times risk of those without comorbid chronic illnesses). Interpretation: To prevent fatality in such conditions, we suggested a high degree of caution in monitoring the kidney functions of severe COVID-19 patients regardless of the past disease history. In addition, upon day-by-day monitoring, clinicians should consider any potential interventions to protect kidney functions at the early stage of the disease and renal replacement therapies in severely ill patients, particularly for those with strong inflammatory reactions or a cytokine storm.

Numerous wearable technologies specific to physical activity and diet are available, but it is unclear if these are effective at improving weight loss. Objective To test the hypothesis that, compared with a standard behavioral weight loss intervention (standard intervention), a technology-enhanced weight loss intervention (enhanced intervention) would result in greater weight loss. Design, Setting, Participants Randomized clinical trial conducted at the University of Pittsburgh and enrolling 471 adult participants between October 2010 and October 2012, with data collection completed by December 2014. Interventions Participants were placed on a low-calorie diet, prescribed increases in physical activity, and had group counseling sessions. At 6 months, the interventions added telephone counseling sessions, text message prompts, and access to study materials on a website. At 6 months, participants randomized to the standard intervention group initiated self-monitoring of diet and physical activity using a website, and those randomized to the enhanced intervention group were provided with a wearable device and accompanying web interface to monitor diet and physical activity. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome of weight was measured over 24 months at 6-month intervals, and the primary hypothesis tested the change in weight between 2 groups at 24 months. Secondary outcomes included body composition, fitness, physical activity, and dietary intake. Results Among the 471 participants randomized (body mass index [BMI], 25 to <40; age range, 18-35 years; 28.9% nonwhite, 77.2% women), 470 (233 in the standard intervention group, 237 in the enhanced intervention group) initiated the interventions as randomized, and 74.5% completed the study. For the enhanced intervention group, mean base line weight was 96.3 kg (95% CI, 94.2-98.5) and 24-month weight 92.8 kg (95% CI, 90.6- 95.0) [corrected]. For the standard intervention group, mean baseline weight was 95.2kg (95%CI,93.0-97.3)and24-month weight was 89.3 kg (95%CI, 87.1-91.5) [corrected]. Weight change at 24 months differed significantly by intervention group (estimated mean weight loss, 3.5 kg [95% CI, 2.6-4.5} in the enhanced intervention group and 5.9 kg [95% CI, 5.0-6.8] in the standard intervention group; difference, 2.4 kg [95% CI, 1.0-3.7]; P = .002). Both groups had significant improvements in body composition, fitness, physical activity, and diet, with no significant difference between groups. Conclusions and Relevance Among young adults with a BMI between 25 and less than 40, the addition of a wearable technology device to a standard behavioral intervention resulted in less weight loss over 24 months. Devices that monitor and provide feedback on physical activity may not offer an advantage over standard behavioral weight loss approaches. Trial Registration clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01131871.", "OBJECTIVE To describe a standing laparoscopic peritoneal flap hernioplasty (PFH) technique for closure of the vaginal ring, and to evaluate its effect on prevention of recurrent herniation in stallions, previously treated for acquired strangulating inguinal hernia (SIH). STUDY DESIGN Case series. ANIMALS Stallions (n = 30) aged 3-15 that had previous acquired SIH. METHODS Bilateral standing laparoscopic PFH was performed on 30 stallions that had previous acquired SIH treated without castration. The vaginal rings were approached from 3 portals, 2 in the paralumbar fossa and a 3rd between the 17th and 18th ribs on the ipsilateral side. A large inverted U-shaped peritoneal flap was dissected from the abdominal wall proximal and cranial to the vaginal ring, reflected caudally over the vaginal ring, and secured to the abdominal wall with laparoscopic staples. In the first 11 stallions, only the cranial and mid third of the vaginal ring was covered. For the next 19 stallions, complete closure of the vaginal ring including the entire caudal aspect of the vaginal ring was achieved. RESULTS SIH recurrence occurred in 4 of 11 stallions with incomplete ring closure whereas no SIH recurrence occurred when the entire vaginal ring was closed. No major complications occurred and cosmetic outcome was excellent. All breeding stallions were successfully used for breeding. CONCLUSION Standing laparoscopic closure of the vaginal ring using a PFH is an effective way to prevent recurrence of SIH provided the entire vaginal ring, including the caudal aspect is covered by the flap. There seems to be no effect on subsequent fertility.", "We present a unique sinus protection technique that uses a short-length supercompliant balloon during the transarterial Onyx embolization for the dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) of the lateral tentorial sinus. With this technique, we temporarily change the Borden classification from type II to type III, avoiding venous compromise and reducing the risk of Onyx migration into the patent sinus. A 54-year-old man presented with left persistent tinnitus of 4 months' duration. Cerebral angiography revealed a Borden type II left lateral tentorial sinus-DAVF associated with retrograde cortical venous reflux draining into the vein of Labb\u00e9. In the venous phase, the ipsilateral transverse-sigmoid sinus was recognized as a functional sinus and the posterior temporal vein drained into the transverse sinus near the drainage channel. We planned to perform transarterial Onyx embolization using a short-length sinus protection balloon to protect against Onyx migration. During transarterial Onyx injection, a 7 \u00d7 7-mm HyperForm balloon was navigated into the affected sinus and positioned to cover the drainage channel from the shunt. After confirming the change in Borden classification with angiography, transarterial Onyx embolization was performed via the middle meningeal artery. This procedure resulted in complete obliteration of the fistula with good patency of both the transverse-sigmoid sinus and neighboring normal cortical veins. No procedure-related complications were observed and the patient remained free of recurrence during the 24-month follow-up period. Short-length balloon-protected Onyx embolization can be safe and effective for the treatment of Borden type II DAVF.", " Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is one of the most common manifestations of atherosclerotic disease worldwide. Peripheral arterial calcification reduces acute success and long-term patency of endovascular therapy for PAD. Several calcium modification devices are available for use in peripheral interventions. Outcomes after peripheral intravascular lithotripsy (IVL), a novel approach using pulsatile sonic waves to treat luminal and medial calcium in patients with PAD, have not been extensively characterized. Therefore, we sought to perform an individual patient-level data (IPD) pooled analysis of available studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of IVL in the treatment of PAD. METHODS AND RESULTS We pooled IPD, including baseline and procedural variables, from five prospective studies which assessed IVL in the treatment of patients with extensive peripheral artery calcification. Final postprocedural percent diameter stenosis (%DS) and procedural angiographic complications were assessed by independent core laboratory. Efficacy endpoints were analyzed using linear mixed effects models and safety endpoints were tabulated overall and by vascular bed. Among 336 patients who underwent endovascular revascularization with use of IVL, there was a significant reduction between pre-procedural and final %DS of 55.1% (95% confidence interval 53.3-57.0%, p < .0001). Core-laboratory assessed lesion-level complications, including flow-limiting dissections (Types D-F), vessel perforation, distal embolization, thrombus, abrupt closure, and no reflow, occurred in 4/328 (1.22%) of treated lesions. CONCLUSIONS The present IPD of five prospective studies, marking the largest analysis to date evaluating the use of IVL in significantly calcified PAD lesions, demonstrates this treatment strategy to be both effective and safe.", " In obese individuals, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is common but often goes undiagnosed, and therefore untreated. The presence of significant fibrosis is a key determinant of NAFLD progression, and liver steatosis has substantial cardiovascular implications. We aimed to determine the diagnostic accuracy of common noninvasive diagnostic tests for steatosis and fibrosis in the obese. METHODS We recruited 182 severely and morbidly obese individuals undergoing bariatric surgery (age 44 \u00b1 12 years, body mass index 45.1 \u00b1 8.3 kg/m2). Medical history, blood tests and liver biopsy were taken on the day of surgery. Serum steatosis and fibrosis scores were calculated. In a subgroup of patients, transient elastography with controlled attenuation parameter (TE/CAP) (n = 82) and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) (n = 49) were performed. RESULTS 1H-MRS had excellent diagnostic accuracy for steatosis, with strong correlation to steatosis (r = 0.647, p < 0.001), good AUROC (0.852, p = 0.001), sensitivity (81.3%) and specificity (87.5%). However, due to low feasibility in this cohort (65.3% success), this was substantially decreased with intention-to-diagnose analysis (sensitivity 50.0%, specificity 60.9%). CAP had good feasibility (80.5%), and performed better in intention-to-diagnose analysis (AUROC 0.688, sensitivity 84.8%, specificity 47.2%). Serum steatosis scores performed poorly, with comparable accuracy to ALT. For significant fibrosis, TE had the best accuracy (AUROC 0.903, p = 0.007), which remained reasonable after intention-to-diagnose analysis (sensitivity 100%, specificity 59.0%). A combination approach using CAP with ALT for steatosis and TE with Forn index for fibrosis yielded reasonable overall accuracy. CONCLUSIONS 1H-MRS and TE/CAP had greatest accuracy for NAFLD-related steatosis and fibrosis. Failure rates in obesity significantly diminished diagnostic ability. Use of a combination of serum and imaging tests improved overall feasibility of assessment and diagnostic accuracy in obese individuals.", "PURPOSE Laparoscopic ventral hernia repair (LVHR) is associated with shorter hospitalization and lower complication rates compared to open ventral hernia repair. We sought to determine if hernia-related factors, such as defect size and re-operative status correlate with postoperative complications, operative times and length of stay (LOS). METHODS The study is a retrospective review of 30-day perioperative outcomes following LVHR in 91 patients who underwent surgery at a single institution from August 2009 through June 2012. A single surgeon performed all procedures. RESULTS Indications for surgery were recurrent incisional hernia in 33 % of patients and primary incisional or ventral abdominal hernias in the rest. Coated polyester mesh with an average size of 348 cm(2) (\u00b1214; range 113-1,036) was used. Mean operative time was 132 min (\u00b166.1; range 53-412). The mean LOS was 4.0 days (\u00b13.5; range 1-22). Complications occurred in 13 patients for overall morbidity of 16.5 % and no mortality. There was one recurrence in 30 days (1.1 %). Patients who had a surgery >120 min or a LOS >1 day were statistically more likely to have multiple hernias, larger defect sizes (>40 cm(2)), larger mesh sizes (>300 cm(2)) or a history of recurrent hernia (P < 0.05). No other clinical or demographic variable evaluated in this study correlated with operative time or LOS. CONCLUSIONS LVHR is safe with a low incidence of perioperative complications. Patients with multiple, larger and recurrent hernias have longer operative times and LOS. This information can be used to guide preoperative planning for the patient, surgeon and treating institution.", "AIMS EA-230 is a human chorionic gonadotropin hormone-derived linear tetrapeptide, developed for the treatment of systemic inflammation-related disorders. EA-230 has shown promising immunomodulatory and tissue-protective effects in animals and an excellent safety profile in human phase I studies that we performed. The present phase IIa study follows-up on these results by investigating the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of EA-230 under systemic inflammatory conditions induced by experimental human endotoxaemia. METHODS In this randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled phase IIa study, systemic inflammation was induced by intravenous administration of Escherichia coli-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS). At t = 0 hours, 36 healthy male volunteers received 2 ng/kg LPS, followed by a 2-hour continuous infusion of EA-230 (15, 45 and 90 mg/kg/h, n = 8 per group) or placebo (n = 12). RESULTS EA-230 was well tolerated and showed a favourable safety profile. Treatment with the highest dose of EA-230 resulted in a significant attenuation of the LPS-induced increase in plasma levels of inflammatory mediators interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-1 receptor antagonist, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, macrophage inflammatory proteins-1\u03b1 and -1\u03b2, and vascular cell adhesion protein-1 (% reduction of 48, 28, 33, 28, 14, 16 and 19 respectively, p < .01), and reduced fever (peak decrease from 1.8 \u00b1 0.1\u00b0C to 1.3 \u00b1 0.2\u00b0C, P < .05) and symptom scores (peak decrease from 7.4 \u00b1 1.0 to 4.0 \u00b1 1.2 points, P < .05). EA-230 exhibited a very short elimination half-life and a large volume of distribution in the highest dosage group (geometric mean and 95% confidence interval: 0.17 [0.12-0.24] hours and 2.2 [1.3-3.8] L/kg, respectively). CONCLUSION Administration of EA-230 is safe and results in attenuation of the systemic inflammatory response in humans.", " The fate and safety of thrombus remnant despite intra-arterial thrombolysis for unexpected thrombus formation has rarely been reported. METHODS From January 2010 to May 2015, 131 consecutive patients with ruptured intracranial aneurysms were treated by endovascular methods at our institution. Among the 21 patients (16%) treated by intra-arterial thrombolysis for the thrombus formation during the procedure, nine patients (nine aneurysms) suffered from thrombus remnant. We reviewed the clinical and radiologic outcomes of patients with thrombus remnant as well as intraoperative and postoperative management of thrombus formation. RESULTS Thrombus formation occurred near the coiled aneurysm in eight patients, and distal embolic occlusion was observed in one patient. All nine patients were initially managed by intra-arterial thrombolysis with tirofiban. One patient with persistent distal embolic occlusion and two patients with distal migration of the thrombus after intra-arterial thrombolysis were additionally treated with stent retriever. One patient with occlusion of the parent artery near the coiled aneurysm despite intra-arterial thrombolysis was partially recanalized by permanent deployment of a stent retriever. Delayed cerebral angiography showed no increase in size of thrombus remnant in any patients. After the procedure, thrombus remnant was managed by intravenous tirofiban. Follow-up CT angiography on the first postoperative day showed patent arterial flow, and ischemic complication related with thromboembolism did not occur in any patients. One patient suffered from hemorrhagic complication. CONCLUSION If the patency of parent artery is maintained and the size of the thrombus remnant does not increase on delayed angiography after intra-arterial thrombolysis, postoperative thromboembolic events rarely occur.", "Although advances in antineoplastic therapy have considerably improved the survival of patients with hematological malignancies, current treatment modalities increase the risk of late complications. Several forms of chronic pulmonary dysfunction due to infectious or noninfectious causes commonly occur in the months to years after chemo-radiotherapy and can be fatal or result in long-term morbidity. The judicious use of prophylactic antimicrobial agents has tipped the balance toward noninfectious etiologies. Hence, while opportunistic infections still contribute to chronic lung disease, late sequelae resulting from antineoplastic therapy have been identified and reported. Patients who proceed to receive hematopoietic cell transplantation (HSCT) are particularly prone to developing lung complications. Pulmonary dysfunction occurring after HSCT may manifest with obstructive or restrictive pulmonary mechanics and may range in severity from subtle, subclinical functional changes to frank respiratory failure. Insights generated using animal models suggest that the immunologic mechanisms contributing to lung inflammation after HSCT may be similar to those responsible for graft-versus host disease. In sum, chronic fibrotic pulmonary dysfunction is a frequent and significant complication facing survivors of hematologic malignancies and their practitioners. The high incidence and suboptimal response to current support care and immunosuppressive therapy underscore the need for heightened awareness and continued research in this area.", " Short-term follow-up studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) survivors suggested that their physical conditions continuously improved in the first year but that their mental health did not. We investigated long-term psychiatric morbidities and chronic fatigue among SARS survivors. METHODS All SARS survivors from the hospitals of a local region in Hong Kong were assessed by a constellation of psychometric questionnaires and a semistructured clinical interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition) to determine the presence of psychiatric disorders and chronic fatigue problems. RESULTS Of 369 SARS survivors, 233 (63.1%) participated in the study (mean period of time after SARS, 41.3 months). Over 40% of the respondents had active psychiatric illnesses, 40.3% reported a chronic fatigue problem, and 27.1% met the modified 1994 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome. Logistic regression analysis suggested that being a health care worker at the time of SARS infection (odds ratio [OR], 3.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12- 9.39; P = .03), being unemployed at follow-up (OR, 4.71; 95% CI, 1.50-14.78; P = .008), having a perception of social stigmatization (OR, 3.03; 95% CI, 1.20-7.60; P = .02), and having applied to the SARS survivors' fund (OR, 2.92; 95% CI, 1.18-7.22; P = .02) were associated with an increased risk of psychiatric morbidities at follow-up, whereas application to the SARS survivors' fund (OR, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.07-6.51; P = .04) was associated with increased risk of chronic fatigue problems. CONCLUSIONS Psychiatric morbidities and chronic fatigue persisted and continued to be clinically significant among the survivors at the 4-year follow-up. Optimization of the treatment of mental health morbidities by a multidisciplinary approach with a view for long-term rehabilitation, especially targeting psychiatric and fatigue problems and functional and occupational rehabilitation, would be needed.", "Objective: To analyze the clinical characteristics of 34 COVID-19 cases and to provide the basis for the prevention and control of the epidemic disease. Methods: Thirty-four COVID-19 patients diagnosed with RT-PCR in the isolation ward of the Fourth People's Hospital of Ningxia Hui autonomous region (infectious diseases hospital) from the January 22 to February 4, 2020 were selected as the research subjects. The clinical data were collected. Excel was used to describe the relationship between clinical classification and age distribution, contact history and date of onset. SPSS 25.0 statistical software was used for analysis. The general information, clinical symptoms, blood test, virus nucleic acid test results, epidemiology, CT imaging, treatment and prognosis were analyzed. Results: There were 5 mild cases (5/34), 24 ordinary cases (24/34), 5 severe cases (5/34). The elderly was more common in severe patients. The main clinical symptoms were fever (27/34)and dry cough(26/34). The peripheral blood showed normal or decreased leukocyte count (33/34), decreased lymphocyte count (12/34). The increase of C-reactive protein (CRP) and D-dimer was related to the severity of the disease. Some patients had mild liver and kidney damage. Six patients were diagnosed through 3 or more times of nucleic acid tests. Sixteen cases had Wuhan related history,13 cases were close contacts, 5 cases had no confirmed route. The clustered infections were found in 6 families. In typical cases, CT showed single or multiple patchy ground glass shadow with thickening of interlobular septum. In severe cases, diffuse lesions of both lungs were found, with ground glass shadow, consolidation shadow and strip shadow coexisting. Thirty-four patients were treated with interferon-\u03b1 and Lopinavir/Ritonavir with good prognosis. Conclusions: The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 were similar to that of general viral pneumonia but with strong infectivity. Close contact and family aggregation caused disease outbreaks. COVID-19 could not be excluded if two nucleic acid tests were negative and high-resolution CT was helpful for differential diagnosis. Early detection, early isolation, early diagnosis and early treatment are important for good prognosis. The effectiveness of antiviral drugs needs to be further verified.", "Implantable long-term central venous port systems (CVPS) are widely used as a permanent means of accessing the vascular system for intravenous delivery of drugs, parenteral nutrition, blood transfusion, and blood sampling. These systems allow easy and repetitive puncture without causing much damage to the vessels. However, the body foreign surface of CVPS induces an inflammatory response with varying intensity (depending on the implant materials) that leads to formation of a fibrous tissue capsule around the implant. This study was designed to investigate the influence of bacterial infection on the tissue reaction induced by implanted CVPS in adult patients. 20 patients (9 women, 11 men, 58 \u00b1 14 yrs of age) were included in this study. These patients received explantation of a polysulfone based CVPS (ChemoSite\u2122, Covidien, Mansfield, USA) due to port related infections (patients with bacterial infections at the implantation site: group A, 5 men, 1 women) or to other reasons such as termination of treatment, thrombosis, or CVPS dysfunction (patients without bacterial infections, group B, 6 men, 8 women) 299.9 \u00b1 261.2 days after CVPS implantation. A sample of the encapsulating tissue covering the CVPS together with surrounding tissue (at least 1 \u00d7 1 cm2) was placed in a small container with fixing agent, a buffered neutral 4% formalin solution (pH 7). Histological sections of the samples were prepared for light microscopic analysis after paraffin embedding. Sections of 3 \u03bcm were cut and stained with haematoxylin and eosin, Weigert's elastic stain, and Heidenhain's azan stain. There was no difference in thickness, collagen and elastin content, or cell and capillary density of the fibrous capsule between both groups. Due to the wound healing reaction involving angiogenesis and fibroblast activation cell density and number of capillaries in the capsule tissue of all patients showed a positive correlation (r = 0.45, p < 0.05). However, the study demonstrated that at the end of the foreign body reaction the artificial tissue layer which covers the CVPS after implantation due to foreign body reaction shows only low reactivity towards infections.", "Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is considered a standard local-regional treatment for intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the most common bridging therapy. This treatment is offered to more than 70% of patients who are on the waiting list for liver transplantation in the United States. HCC typically receives its blood supply from the hepatic artery; however, it can recruit a parasitic supply from extrahepatic collateral (EHC) arteries. The development of an EHC arterial blood supply can interfere with the therapeutic efficacy of TACE and result in treatment failure and poor outcome. Cross-sectional imaging-specifically computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging-has some limitations in depicting the presence or absence of an EHC arterial supply during the pre-TACE evaluation. Catheterization and angiography of every possible EHC artery during a routine TACE procedure would be time consuming and technically challenging and would not always be feasible. Therefore, the prediction of a potential EHC arterial supply on the basis of tumor location before, during, and after TACE is fundamental to achieving optimal therapeutic efficacy. To perform TACE through EHC arteries, special considerations are necessary to avoid potentially serious complications. The authors review the factors influencing the development of an EHC arterial blood supply to HCC and describe a systematic approach to enhance the ability to predict the presence of EHC arteries. They also describe the proper technique for TACE of each EHC artery and how to avoid potential technique-related complications. \u00a9RSNA, 2017.", " Current strategies of swallowing therapy include facilitation of swallowing initiation by sensory modulation. Although thermal tactile oral stimulation is a common method to treat dysphagic patients to improve swallowing movement, little is known about the possible mechanisms. This study is aimed to investigate whether thermal oral (tongue) stimulation can modulate the cortico-pharyngeal neural motor pathway in humans. METHODS Eighteen healthy volunteers participated and were intubated with an intraluminal catheter for recording pharyngeal electromyography. Each participant underwent baseline transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) cortico-pharyngeal motor evoked potential (MEP) measurements bilaterally. MEPs were then measured during thermal stimulation over the dorsal tongue, applied using the Peltier device at three different temperatures; 45\u00b0C, 37\u00b0C, and 15\u00b0C, in a pre-ordered manner. Each of the three temperatures was given twice with a 5-min resting time between each trial. Averaged MEP amplitude changes were analyzed using ANOVA and post-hoc t-tests. KEY RESULTS Two-way repeated measures ANOVA with factors of Temperature \u00d7 Trial in amplitude of MEP demonstrated a significant effect of Temperature both in the stronger (F2,34 = 5.775, P = .007) and weaker (F2,34 = 4.771, P = .017) pharyngeal hemispheres. Subsequent post-hoc tests showed the significant increase in pharyngeal MEPs at 15\u00b0 compared to 37\u00b0 in both hemispheres (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES Cold oral stimulation was able to induce significant changes in pharyngeal cortical excitability, demonstrating evidence for a sensorimotor interaction between oral and pharyngeal cortical areas.", "PURPOSE Stenting in intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) is increasingly debated, due to issues of procedural safety, technical efficacy, and in-stent recurrent stenoses (ISR). In the present study, feasibility, safety, and efficacy of angioplasty using a drug-eluting balloon (DEB) followed by the implantation of a self-expanding stent (Enterprise) were evaluated for the treatment of ICAD lesions. METHODS Fifty-two patients (median age: 71 years; range: 54-86 years; male/female ratio 37:15) underwent stenting of high-grade ICAD lesions between February 2010 and November 2011 in a single center. Angioplasty using a paclitaxel coated SeQuent Please (B. Braun, Germany) or DIOR (Eurocor, Germany) coronary PTCA balloon, followed by the implantation of a self-expanding stent (Enterprise, Codman, USA) was performed in 54 lesions. Angiographic and clinical follow-up was performed at 6 and 12 weeks, 6 and 12 months, and yearly thereafter. Technical success rate, periprocedural complications, occurrence of recurrent ischemic symptoms, and the development of an ISR were analyzed. RESULTS Angioplasty using a DEB followed by stent implantation was successfully performed in 44 (81 %) cases. DEB insertion failed in 19 % of the cases and angioplasty was finally performed using a conventional PTCA balloon. The combined procedure related permanent neurologic morbidity and mortality rate (stroke, ICH, and subarachnoid hemorrhage) at 30 days and beyond was 5 %. Angiographic and clinical follow-up were obtained in 33 (61 %) lesions in 32 patients. Recurrent stenosis was seen in one (3 %) lesion. CONCLUSION Angioplasty and stenting using a DEB is safe and yields encouragingly low ISR rates. Further technical developments to improve lesion accessibility are, nevertheless, mandatory.", " The objective of this study was to evaluate the coagulation profile by thromboelastography in morbidly obese patients who undergo bariatric surgery. Morbid obesity entails increased risk for thromboembolic events. There is no clear protocol for thromboembolic prophylaxis, regarding timing and length of treatment, in bariatric surgery. Thromboelastography provides data on a coagulation process from creation of the clot until the fibrinolysis. METHODS Ninety-three morbidly obese patients were prospectively recruited within a 2-year period. Coagulation profile was measured by thromboelastography before surgery, in the immediate postoperative period, within 3 h from surgery, and in the late postoperative period, within 10-14 days after surgery. Venous thromboembolic prophylaxis was achieved by giving low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), once a day. RESULTS Of the eligible patients, 67 underwent sleeve gastrectomy while 23 underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Normal values of coagulation factor function, clotting time, and fibrin function, as measured by R, K, and \u03b1 (angle), were demonstrated in addition to higher maximal amplitude (MA) values, reflecting increased function of platelets. The average MA value before the surgery was above normal and continued rising consistently in the immediate postoperative as well as in the early postoperative period. CONCLUSIONS Morbidly obese patients have a strong tendency toward thrombosis, as demonstrated by pathologically elevated MA values. Altered coagulation profiles were demonstrated 2 weeks postoperatively; thus, prophylaxis that continued at least for 2 weeks after bariatric surgery should be considered. Since LMW heparin is not sufficient alone as thromboembolic prophylaxis, we recommend adding antiplatelet therapy. Further evaluation of appropriate thromboprophylaxis is warranted.", " Transanal minimally invasive surgery (TAMIS) has emerged as an alternative to transanal endoscopic microsurgery. We assessed the feasibility of TAMIS for lesions located in the mid rectum. METHODS From July 2010 to October 2011, 16 consecutive patients with rectal pathology underwent TAMIS. After a single-incision laparoscopic surgery port was introduced into the anal canal, pneumorectum was established with a laparoscopic device, followed by transanal excision with conventional laparoscopic instruments, including graspers, monopolar electrocautery, and needle drivers. Clinicopathological findings, surgical procedure results, and perioperative outcomes were determined prospectively. RESULTS Of the 16 patients, 11 had rectal cancers (3 T1 lesions and 8 after preoperative chemoradiotherapy), 4 had neuroendocrine tumors, and 1 had a mucocele. The median length of the lesions from anal verge was 7.5 cm (range 4-10 cm). All procedures were completed laparoscopically without conversion to conventional transanal approach. The median operating time was 86 min (range 33-160 min), and the median estimated blood loss was 15 ml (range 0-150 ml) with no patient requiring intraoperative transfusions. There was no surgical morbidity or mortality, but one patient died during follow-up due to synchronous advanced gastric cancer. The median postoperative hospital stay was 3 days (range 2-6 days). CONCLUSIONS TAMIS seems to be a feasible and safe treatment option for lesions located in the mid rectum.", " Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies enable the investigation of neural correlates underlying behavioral performance. We investigate the effect of active and sham Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) treatment on working memory function of patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) considering Task Positive and Default Mode networks (TPN and DMN). METHODS An experiment with 4 levels of visuospatial n-back task was used to investigate the pattern of cortical activation in 17 men with moderate or severe OSAS before and after 2 months of therapeutic (active) or sub-therapeutic (sham) CPAP treatment. RESULTS Patients with untreated OSAS had significantly less deactivation in the temporal regions of the DMN as compared to healthy controls, but activation within TPN regions was comparatively relatively preserved. After 2 months of treatment, active and sham CPAP groups exhibited opposite trends of cerebral activation and deactivation. After treatment, the active CPAP group demonstrated an increase of cerebral activation in the TPN at all task levels and of task-related cerebral deactivation in the anterior midline and medial temporal regions of the DMN at the 3-back level, associated with a significant improvement of behavioral performance, whereas the sham CPAP group exhibited less deactivation in the temporal regions of Default Mode Network and less Task Positive Network activation associated to longer response times at the 3-back. CONCLUSION OSAS has a significant negative impact primarily on task-related DMN deactivation, particularly in the medial temporal regions, possibly due to nocturnal hypoxemia, as well as TPN activation, particularly in the right ventral fronto-parietal network. After 2 months of active nasal CPAP treatment a positive response was noted in both TPN and DMN but without compete recovery of existing behavioral and neuronal deficits. Initiation of CPAP treatment early in the course of the disease may prevent or slow down the occurrence of irreversible impairment.", "OBJECTIVES Barrett's esophagus (BE) is the only identifiable premalignant condition for esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). Management of BE with low-grade dysplasia continues to be controversial. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing the risk of progression to high-grade dysplasia or EAC among patients with BE with low-grade dysplasia treated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) compared with surveillance endoscopy. METHODS Our search included Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Central, was limited to English language articles, and was last searched on 31 December 2015. Studies were reviewed by title and abstract, and then full text by two independent reviewers. Two independent reviewers extracted data. Differences were resolved by consensus. The primary outcome of interest was the relative risk of disease progression among patients with BE with low-grade dysplasia treated with RFAcompared with surveillance. RESULTS Our search resulted in 2,029 citations, 19 studies were included in the final analysis, totaling 2,746 patients. Relative risk of disease progression in RFA compared with surveillance was 0.14% (95% confidence interval: 0.04-0.45), P=0.001. This measure was stable when only all studies were included. Absolute risk reduction was 10.9% and the number needed to treat was 9.2. Results were stable over several quality measures, overtime, and when excluding randomized trials. The cumulative rate of progression to high-grade dysplasia/EAC was lower in RFA compared with surveillance (1.7% vs. 12.6%, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS Similarly, the incidence rate of progression among patients with surveillance was significantly higher from those treated with RFA (0.022 vs. 0.005, P<0.001). RFA results in a significant reduction risk of disease progression to high-grade dysplasia/EAC among patients with BE with low-grade dysplasia.", "STUDY OBJECTIVE To show a surgical video in which a retroperitoneal extragastrointestinal stromal tumor was resected with the laparoscopic approach in the presacral area. DESIGN A case report (Canadian Task Force classification III). The local ethics committee waived the requirement for approval. SETTING A very small proportion of extragastrointestinal stromal tumors (EGISTs) is located in the retroperitoneal region. There are insufficient data on the clinical and pathologic features and the long-term follow-up of these tumors [1]. There are a few cases reported in the presacral region in the literature. The gold standard treatment for EGISTs is complete surgical excision of the mass. If it is possible, en bloc excision with its surrounding tissue is very important [2]. PATIENT A 53-year-old woman. The patient provided informed consent to use images and videos of the procedure. INTERVENTIONS This is a step-by-step illustration for resection of a retroperitoneal EGIST in the presacral area. The patient was a 53-year-old, gravida 3, para 3 white woman. She presented with abdominal pain for 5 months. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a 4-cm diameter solid mass localized at the presacral area. Laboratory test results for tumor biomarkers were as follows: cancer antigen (CA) 125 = 40 U/mL (normal values <35 U/mL), CA 19-9 = 29 U/mL (normal values <37 U/mL), carcinoembryonic antigen = 2.1 ng/mL (normal values <3 ng/mL), and CA 15.3 = 18 U/mL (normal values <35 U/mL). Because of malignancy suspicion, gastroscopy and colonoscopy were performed and revealed no abnormality. The Papanicolaou smear and endometrial biopsy results were negative. After preparation of the patient, laparoscopy was performed. After placement of an 11-mm umbilical port and three 5-mm abdominal ports, the pelvis and abdomen were explored and revealed a 4-cm retroperitoneal mass in the presacral area. The peritoneum overlying the presacral mass was incised and the retroperitoneum explored. Given the proximity to the mass, left ureterolysis was performed. The mass was located on the left internal iliac vein and dissected carefully. The retroperitoneal attachments were resected, and the presacral mass was removed without any complications. In order not to widen the abdominal incisions, a posterior colpotomy was performed in the cul-de-sac at equal distances from the uterosacral ligaments. An Endobag (Covidien, Dublin, Ireland) was introduced through the 5-mm port site at the posterior colpotomy. The specimen was removed in the Endobag through posterior colpotomy. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS The procedure was performed without any complications. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course and was discharged home on postoperative day 2. Pathology revealed a 4-cm retroperitoneal EGIST with negative margins. Immunohistochemistry measurements revealed hematoxylin-eosin; CD117; S100 positivity; and CD34, CD68, desmin, and DOG1 negativity. The cell type was mixed (spindle and epithelioid type). The mitotic rate was 1 to 2/50 high-power fields. The patient has been disease free since the completion of surgery. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic complete resection of the retroperitoneal EGIST in the presacral area is successfully performed in this patient. The patient presented by us is an example showing that minimally invasive procedures can be used in the treatment of this type of tumor in the presacral area. The key point in this operation is to control the relationship of vascular structures and a ureter with a tumor in every step to avoid any injury.", "The microenvironment of pancreatic cancer adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is highly desmoplastic with distinct tumor-restraining and tumor-promoting fibroblast subpopulations. Re-education rather than indiscriminate elimination of these fibroblasts has emerged as a new strategy for combination therapy. Here, we studied the effects of global loss of pro-fibrotic non-coding regulatory microRNA-21 (miR-21) in K-Ras-driven p53-deleted genetically engineered mouse models of PDAC. Strikingly, loss of miR-21 accelerated tumor initiation via mucinous cystic neoplastic lesions and progression to locally advanced invasive carcinoma from which animals precipitously succumbed at an early age. The absence of tumor-restraining myofibroblasts and a massive infiltrate of immune cells were salient phenotypic features of global miR-21 loss. Stromal miR-21 activity was required for induction of tumor-restraining myofibroblasts in in-vivo isograft transplantation experiments. Low miR-21 expression negatively correlated with a fibroblast gene expression signature and positively with an immune cell gene expression signature in TCGA PDAC data set (n = 156) mirroring findings in the mouse models. Our results exposed an overall tumor suppressive function of miR-21 in in-vivo PDAC models. These results have important clinical implications for anti-miR-21-based inhibitory therapeutic approaches under consideration for PDAC and other cancer types. Mechanistic dissection of the cell-intrinsic role of miR-21 in cancer-associated fibroblasts and other cell types will be needed to inform best strategies for pharmacological modulation of miR-21 activity in order to remodel the tumor microenvironment and enhance treatment response in PDAC.

Preoperative identification of patients with high risk of recurrent disease might enable individualized treatment based on patients' risk profile. The aim of the present work was to investigate the role of metabolic parameters derived from the pre-ablation 18F-FDG PET/CT as imaging biomarkers for recurrent disease in patients with colorectal liver metastases (CLM). METHODS Included in this retrospective study were all consecutive patients with CLM treated with percutaneous or open thermal ablation therapy who had a pre-treatment baseline 18F-FDG PET/CT available. Multivariable cox regression for survival analysis was performed using different models for the metabolic parameters (SULpeak, SULmean, SULmax, partial volume corrected SULmean (cSULmean), and total lesion glycolysis (TLG)) corrected for tumour and procedure characteristics. The study endpoints were defined as local tumour progression free survival (LTP-FS), new intrahepatic recurrence free survival (NHR-FS) and extrahepatic recurrence free survival (EHR-FS). Clinical and imaging follow-up data was used as the reference standard. RESULTS Fifty-four patients with 90 lesions were selected. Univariable cox regression analysis resulted in eight models. Multivariable analysis revealed that after adjusting for lesion size and the approach of the procedure, none of the metabolic parameters were associated with LTP-FS or EHR-FS. Percutaneous approach was significantly associated with a shorter LTP-FS. It was demonstrated that lower values of SULpeak, SULmax, SULmean , and cSULmean are associated with a significant better NHR-FS, independent of the lesion size and number and prior chemotherapy. CONCLUSION We found no association between the metabolic parameters on pre-ablation 18F-FDG PET/CT and the LTP-FS. However, low values of the metabolic parameters were significantly associated with improved NHR-FS. The clinical implication of these findings might be the identification of high-risk patients who might benefit most from adjuvant or combined treatment strategies.", "Among odontogenic tumors, odontoma is the most frequent. The common treatment contemplates a conservative approach. While this procedure is generally accepted and tolerated, some difficulties may be encountered in the case of pediatric patients. Indeed, negative feelings of tension, apprehension, nervousness, and fear are likely to occur. The present report is aimed at discussing the management of a compound odontoma in a pediatric patient under anxiolysis with diazepam on an outpatient basis. The surgery was carried out without complications, and the discharge was completed safely. Oral premedication with diazepam should be considered to avoid more invasive sedation procedures in anxious pediatric patients.", "Adult-onset Still\u2019s Disease (AOSD) since its description in 1971 has proven to be a very complex and challenging disease entity. This rare auto-inflammatory disease is classically described by the \u201cStill\u2019s triad\u201d of fever, rash, and arthritis, although the atypical cases frequently outnumber the typical ones. The exact pathogenesis and etiologic factors responsible for the clinical features remain largely obscure, despite recent suggestive cytokine biology findings. Diagnosis is made on clinical grounds, following the exclusion of mimickers of infectious, autoimmune or neoplastic etiology, with the additional consideration of non-specific laboratory abnormalities such as peripheral leukocytosis and elevation of serum ferritin and other acute phase reactants. The disease manifestations are protean and can include diverse complications, affecting multiple organ systems. Moreover, the severity of the organ involvement can vary considerably, representing a wide spectrum from the self-limited to severe. The mainstay of therapy has evolved from the traditional use of corticosteroids and oral immunosupressants to the newer targeted treatments with biologic agents. The scope of this review is to alert the clinician to the existence of life-threatening AOSD complications, namely the macrophage activation syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, and pulmonary arterial hypertension. Such knowledge may lead in earlier recognition, prompt treatment, and, ideally, improved patient outcomes.", "Purpose After radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), pre- and postinterventional contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) images are usually qualitatively interpreted to determine technical success, by eyeballing. The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of quantitative assessment, using a nonrigid CT-CT coregistration algorithm. Materials and Methods 25 patients treated with RFA for HCC between 2009 and 2014 were retrospectively included. Semiautomated coregistration of pre- and posttreatment CECT was performed independently by two radiologists. In scans with a reliable registration, the tumor and ablation area were delineated to identify the side and size of narrowest RFA margin. In addition, qualitative assessment was performed independently by two other radiologists to determine technical success and the anatomical side and size of narrowest margin. Interobserver agreement rates were determined for both methods, and the outcomes were compared with occurrence of local tumor progression (LTP). Results CT-CT coregistration was technically feasible in 18/25 patients with almost perfect interobserver agreement for quantitative analysis (\u03ba = 0.88). The interobserver agreement for qualitative RFA margin analysis was \u03ba = 0.64. Using quantitative assessment, negative ablative margins were found in 12/18 patients, with LTP occurring in 8 of these patients. In the remaining 6 patients, quantitative analysis demonstrated complete tumor ablation and no LTP occurred. Conclusion Feasibility of quantitative RFA margin assessment using nonrigid coregistration of pre- and postablation CT is limited, but appears to be a valuable tool in predicting LTP in HCC patients (p=0.013).", " Abdominoplasty, with or without liposuction, is among the most frequently performed aesthetic procedures. Its main objective is to improve the body contour by means of excising redundant skin and fat tissue. Although abdominoplasty is considered a safe procedure with high satisfaction rates, intraoperative and postoperative complications can become a challenge for the surgical team. The aim of this article is to offer a synopsis of the most common complications arising after abdominoplasty, along with evidence-based guidelines about how to prevent and treat them. METHODS A systematic MEDLINE search strategy was designed using appropriate Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms, and references were scanned for further relevant articles. RESULTS According to the published case series, local complications are considerably more common than complications with systemic repercussions. Approximately 10% to 20% of patients suffer a local complication following abdominoplasty, while fewer than 1% suffer a systemic complication. Prevention and management strategies are critically discussed for complications including seroma, haematoma, infection, skin necrosis, suture extrusions, hypertrophic scars, neurological symptoms, umbilical anomalies, deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary thromboembolism, respiratory distress, and death. CONCLUSIONS The complications of abdominoplasty vary in severity and in the impact they have on the aesthetic outcomes. Recommendations for prevention and management are based on various levels of evidence, with a risk of observer bias. However, most complications can be treated appropriately following the current standards, with satisfactory results.", " Baseline rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) activity is a well-replicated nonspecific predictor of depression improvement. The rACC is a key hub of the default mode network, which prior studies indicate is hyperactive in major depressive disorder. Because default mode network downregulation is reliant on input from the salience network and frontoparietal network, an important question is whether rACC connectivity with these systems contributes to depression improvement. METHODS Our study evaluated this hypothesis in outpatients (N = 238; 151 female) enrolled in the Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response for Clinical Care (EMBARC) 8-week randomized clinical trial of sertraline versus placebo for major depressive disorder. Depression severity was measured using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, and electroencephalography was recorded at baseline and week 1. Exact low-resolution electromagnetic tomography was used to compute activity from the rACC, and key regions within the default mode network (posterior cingulate cortex), frontoparietal network (left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), and salience network (right anterior insula [rAI]). Connectivity in the theta band (4.5-7 Hz) and beta band (12.5-21 Hz) was computed using lagged phase synchronization. RESULTS Stronger baseline theta-band rACC-rAI (salience network hub) connectivity predicted greater depression improvement across 8 weeks of treatment for both treatment arms (B = -0.57, 95% confidence interval = -1.07, -0.08, p = .03). Early increases in theta-band rACC-rAI connectivity predicted greater likelihood of achieving remission at week 8 (odds ratio = 2.90, p = .03). CONCLUSIONS Among patients undergoing treatment, theta-band rACC-rAI connectivity is a prognostic, albeit treatment-nonspecific, indicator of depression improvement, and early connectivity changes may predict clinically meaningful outcomes.", " Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is an uncommon complication of bariatric surgery but a leading cause of postoperative mortality. Studying the factors predictive of low-incidence complications requires the analysis of large cohorts. The Bariatric Outcomes Longitudinal Database, the world's largest prospective database for bariatric surgery, has provided a suitable medium for analyzing low-frequency events. METHODS The data in the Bariatric Outcomes Longitudinal Database from 73,921 research-consented patients who had undergone bariatric surgery by a participant in the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Bariatric Surgery Center of Excellence program before September 22, 2009, were analyzed for VTE events within 90 days after surgery. RESULTS The overall risk of VTE within 90 days after surgery was .42%, and 73% of these events occurred after discharge, most within 30 days after surgery. The risk of VTE was greater in the patients undergoing gastric bypass than in those undergoing adjustable gastric banding (.55% versus .16%). VTE was more frequent when the procedure was performed using an open than a laparoscopic approach (1.54% versus .34%). Patients with a VTE event were older (+4.9 yr), had had a greater preoperative body mass index (+3.9 kg/m(2)), and were more likely to have a history of VTE (16.5% versus 3.7%). The risk of VTE was greater in men (hazard ratio 2.32, 95% confidence interval 1.81-2.98) and in patients with an inferior vena cava filter (hazard ratio 7.66, 95% confidence interval 4.55-12.91). CONCLUSION The overall risk of VTE was low in the population treated by participants in the Bariatric Surgery Center of Excellence program, where clinical pathways to prevent VTE have been mandated. Analysis of this large study population allowed the identification of patient characteristics correlating with increased risk of postoperative VTE and the variable effectiveness of VTE prophylaxis methods.", "Hip fractures are common orthopedic injuries and are associated with significant morbidity/mortality. Intraoperative normothermia is recommended by national guidelines to minimize additional morbidity/mortality, but limited evidence exists regarding hypothermia's effect on orthopedic patients. The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of intraoperative hypothermia in patients with operatively treated hip fractures and evaluate its effect on complications and outcomes. Retrospective chart review was performed on clinical records from 1541 consecutive patients who sustained a hip fracture and underwent operative fixation at the authors' institution between January 2005 and October 2013. A total of 1525 patients were included for analysis, excluding those with injuries requiring additional surgical intervention. Patient demographic data, surgery-specific data, postoperative complications, length of stay, and 30-day readmission were recorded. Patients with a mean intraoperative temperature less than 36\u00b0C were identified as hypothermic. Statistical analysis with univariate and multivariate logistic regression modeling evaluated associations with hypothermia and effect on complications/outcomes. The incidence of intraoperative hypothermia in operatively treated hip fractures was 17.0%. Hypothermia was associated with an increase in the rate of deep surgical-site infection (odds ratio, 3.30; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-9.14; P=.022). Lower body mass index and increasing age demonstrated increased association with hypothermia (P=.004 and P=.005, respectively). To the authors' knowledge, this is the first and largest study analyzing the effect of intraoperative hypothermia in orthopedic patients. In patients with hip fractures, the study's findings confirm evidence found in other surgical specialties that hypothermia may be associated with an increased risk of deep surgical-site infection and that lower body mass index and increasing age are risk factors for intraoperative hypothermia.

With this technique, we temporarily change the Borden classification from type II to type III, avoiding venous compromise and reducing the risk of Onyx migration into the patent sinus. A 54-year-old man presented with left persistent tinnitus of 4 months' duration. Cerebral angiography revealed a Borden type II left lateral tentorial sinus-DAVF associated with retrograde cortical venous reflux draining into the vein of Labb\u00e9. In the venous phase, the ipsilateral transverse-sigmoid sinus was recognized as a functional sinus and the posterior temporal vein drained into the transverse sinus near the drainage channel. We planned to perform transarterial Onyx embolization using a short-length sinus protection balloon to protect against Onyx migration. During transarterial Onyx injection, a 7 \u00d7 7-mm HyperForm balloon was navigated into the affected sinus and positioned to cover the drainage channel from the shunt. After confirming the change in Borden classification with angiography, transarterial Onyx embolization was performed via the middle meningeal artery. This procedure resulted in complete obliteration of the fistula with good patency of both the transverse-sigmoid sinus and neighboring normal cortical veins. No procedure-related complications were observed and the patient remained free of recurrence during the 24-month follow-up period. Short-length balloon-protected Onyx embolization can be safe and effective for the treatment of Borden type II DAVF.", " Laparoscopic gastric devascularization of the upper stomach in patients with gastric varices has rarely been reported. Perioperative clinical data were compared with patients who underwent open surgery. PRESENTATION OF CASES From 2009 to 2012, we performed laparoscopic gastric devascularization without splenectomy for the treatment of gastric varices in eight patients. The patients included four males and four females. Peri-gastric vessels were divided using electrical coagulating devices or other devices according to the diameter of the vessels. Two patients underwent conversion to open surgery due to intraoperative bleeding. DISCUSSION Intraoperative blood loss in patients who accomplished laparoscopic devascularization was very small (mean 76ml). However, once bleeding occurs, there is a risk of causing massive bleeding. CONCLUSION With further improvement of laparoscopic devices, laparoscopic gastric devascularization without splenectomy must be an effective and less-invasive surgical procedure in the treatment of gastric varices.", "OBJECTIVES First-rib resection is a key component in the treatment of Paget-Schroetter syndrome. We report our experience with robotic first-rib resection. METHODS Patients diagnosed with Paget-schroetter syndrome underwent thrombolysis followed by robotic first-rib resection. The diagnosis was made by preoperative venography (VA) and magnetic resonance venography. The robot was used to dissect the first rib, disarticulate the costosternal joint and divide the scalene muscles. Success of the first-rib resection was assessed by physical examination, venogram and magnetic resonance venography. RESULTS Eighty-three robotic first-rib resections were performed (49 men and 34 women). The mean age of the patients was 24 years \u00b1 8.5 years. The operative time was 127.6 min \u00b1 20.8 min. The median hospitalization was 4 days. There were no surgical complications, neurovascular injuries or mortality. Patients with a patent subclavian vein on the postoperative venogram (57 of 83 patients, 69%) were anticoagulated with warfarin for 3 months. In the remaining 27 patients with a persistent postoperative occlusion of the subclavian vein, 21 (21 of 83 patients, 24%) underwent angioplasty and were anticoagulated with warfarin for 3 months, and 6 (6 of 83, 7%) required stent placement to achieve complete vein patency. Patients who underwent stent placement received antiplatelet therapy in addition to warfarin anticoagulation for 3 months. At a median follow-up of 24 months, all patients had an open subclavian vein with a patency rate of 100%. CONCLUSIONS The robotic transthoracic first-rib resection is feasible and allows for a minimally invasive resection of the first rib, while minimizing neurovascular complications.", "Background The aim of the present study is to analyze the feasibility, safety and learning curve of Mini- Laparoscopic Lateral suspension (LLS) for the treatment of apical and anterior defects following pelvic organ prolapse. Methods This is a cohort study on a retrospective series of 35 consecutive patients who underwent Mini-LLS for symptomatic POP between January 2014 and July 2016. All 35 patients were operated at the Gynaecological Unit in S. Chiara Hospital by two senior surgeons (S. Tateo and L. Mereu) and by a team with optimal skills in laparoscopic surgery. Patients were divided in two groups according to two different chronological phases: phase 1 identified the initial 12 cases, phase 2 the last 23 cases. We collected pre-, peri- and post-operative information to analyze the surgical outcomes and learning curve after Mini-LLS procedures. Results The mean LLS-Overall Time (OT) was 107.6 min (range, 185- 63 min). None of the patients had intra-operative complications. No conversion to laparotomy was necessary. The mean post-operative hospital stay was 58 hours in total (SD +/-22). Only in 3 cases (8.6 %) post-operative grade I complications were observed. Recurrence of POP was observed in 3 cases (8.6 %) during a mean follow up of 18 months. The mean OT decreased with experience, in particular after the first 12 cases (phase 1: 113.54 minutes versus phase 2: 104.43 minutes). In consequence, the reduction of time per procedure was statistically significant considering the Cusum Time (CT) (P < .05). Conclusions Mini-LLS with mesh is a safe and reproducible technique with good anatomical results, low complication rates and a short learning curve.", "Rationale To prevent recurrent venous thrombotic events after acute cerebral venous or dural sinus thrombosis, guidelines recommend long-term oral anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists. Non-vitamin K oral anticoagulant experience in cerebral venous or dural sinus thrombosis is limited to case reports and series. Aim To compare dabigatran with dose-adjusted warfarin in patients with cerebral venous or dural sinus thrombosis for the prevention of recurrent venous thrombotic event. Sample size One hundred and twenty patients. Methods and design This study is a phase III, prospective, randomized, parallel-group, open-label, multicenter, exploratory trial with blinded endpoint adjudication. Patients with acute cerebral venous or dural sinus thrombosis after 5-15 days of treatment with parenteral heparin are randomized to either dabigatran etexilate 150 mg twice daily or dose-adjusted (international normalized ratio 2-3) warfarin (\u226424 weeks). Study outcome The primary endpoint is a composite of patients with new venous thrombotic event (recurring cerebral venous or dural sinus thrombosis, deep venous thrombosis of any limb, pulmonary embolism, and major bleeding (International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis definition)) during the treatment period. Statistics will be descriptive (number and frequencies). Study timelines Inclusion started in December 2016. Final results are expected by the end of 2018. Discussion This exploratory trial is the first to compare vitamin K with non-vitamin K antagonists in cerebral venous or dural sinus thrombosis. It will provide evidence to guide physicians and patients in choosing oral anticoagulants to prevent venous thrombotic event after acute cerebral venous or dural sinus thrombosis. ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT02913326.", "Radiation therapy is an essential component of cancer care, contributing up to 40% of curative cancer treatment regimens. It creates DNA double-strand breaks causing cell death in highly replicating tumour cells. However, tumours can develop acquired resistance to therapy. The efficiency of radiation treatment has been increased by means of combining it with other approaches such as chemotherapy, molecule-targeted therapies and, in recent years, immunotherapy. Cancer-cell apoptosis after radiation treatment causes an immunological reaction that contributes to eradicate the tumour via antigen presentation and subsequent T-cell activation. On the other hand, radiotherapy also contributes to the formation of an immunosuppressive environment that hinders the efficacy of the therapy. Innate immune cells from myeloid and lymphoid origin show a very active role in both acquired resistance and anti-tumorigenic mechanisms. Therefore, many efforts are being made in order to reach a better understanding of the innate immunity reactions after radiation therapy and the design of new combinatorial immunotherapy strategies focused in these particular populations.", "Previous studies have demonstrated that mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) hepatotropism is determined largely by postentry events rather than by availability of the viral receptor. In addition, mutation of MHV nonstructural protein 2 (ns2) abrogates the ability of the virus to replicate in the liver and induce hepatitis but does not affect replication in the central nervous system (CNS). Here we show that replication of ns2 mutant viruses is attenuated in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM) generated from wild-type (wt) mice but not in L2 fibroblasts, primary astrocytes, or BMM generated from type I interferon receptor-deficient (IFNAR(-/-)) mice. In addition, ns2 mutants are more sensitive than wt virus to pretreatment of BMM, but not L2 fibroblasts or primary astrocytes, with alpha/beta interferon (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2). The ns2 mutants induced similar levels of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 in wt and IFNAR(-/-) BMM, indicating that ns2 expression has no effect on the induction of IFN but rather that it antagonizes a later step in IFN signaling. Consistent with these in vitro data, the virulence of ns2 mutants increased to near that of wt virus after depletion of macrophages in vivo. These data imply that the ability of MHV to replicate in macrophages is a prerequisite for replication in the liver and induction of hepatitis but not for replication or disease in the CNS, underscoring the importance of IFN signaling in macrophages in vivo for protection of the host from hepatitis. Our results further support the notion that viral tissue tropism is determined in part by postentry events, including the early type I interferon response.", "Purposes Seroma is a postoperative complication following laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal repair (TAPP) for inguinal hernioplasty. Seroma naturally resolves in most cases, but it can lead to an increased amount of visits to the outpatient clinic and can result in anxiety of the patient. Local inflammation of the inguinal area is etiology of seroma formation. Strangulated hernia involves severe inguinal pain and can lead to severe inflammation and subsequent seroma. There have been no reports demonstrating the links of seroma and strangulated hernia. This study aimed to retrospectively evaluate the risk of seroma after TAPP and to identify the association between strangulated hernia and seroma. Methods We treated 300 inguinal hernias by TAPP between 2013 and 2016 at Kurashiki Central Hospital. We used the Chi-square test. Factors significant in each association were further examined using multiple subsequent logistic regressions. Results A total of 222 hernias were eligible for analysis. The incidence of seroma was 11% (n=25). There were nine cases of strangulated hernias, and three (33%) resulted in seroma. The ratio of strangulated hernia of seroma group is significantly high (p<0.03). Multiple subsequent logistic regressions showed that strangulated hernia was associated with a significantly increased risk for seroma formation (p = 0.023; OR 6.564; 95% CI 1.29-33.3). Conclusion This study shows that strangulated hernia can be a risk factor in seroma formation. This risk should be incorporated into a management plan of TAPP for strangulated hernia, with careful consideration of patients' concerns.", "OBJECTIVE To describe a series of patients with bilateral acute iris transillumination, pigment dispersion, and sphincter paralysis. METHODS We reviewed the medical records and clinical photographs of 26 patients seen at 5 centers in Turkey and Belgium between March 16, 2006, and July 6, 2010. Observation procedures included clinical examination, anterior segment color photography, gonioscopy, laser flare photometry, and pupillometry. RESULTS All 26 patients (20 women and 6 men; mean [SD] age, 43.2 [10.5] years) had bilateral involvement. Twenty-three patients (88%) had acute-onset disease with severe photophobia and red eyes. Nineteen patients (73%) had a preceding flulike illness and used systemic antibiotics, including moxifloxacin. Diagnostic laboratory workup was unremarkable. There was pigment discharge into the anterior chamber, and flare was elevated in the absence of inflammatory cells. Most patients had severe diffuse transillumination of the iris and mydriatic distorted pupils. Pupillometry revealed a compromised reaction to light. The most serious complication was an intractable early rise in intraocular pressure. Gonioscopy revealed heavy pigment deposition in the trabecular meshwork. Although symptoms were relieved promptly by application of topical corticosteroid, the median duration of pigment dispersion was 5.25 months. CONCLUSIONS Bilateral acute iris transillumination with pigment dispersion and persistent mydriasis is a new clinical entity that is not an ocular adverse effect of oral moxifloxacin treatment, as previously suggested. The etiopathogenesis of this entity remains to be elucidated.", "We aimed to demonstrate the feasibility and total cost of laparoscopy-assisted suprapubic salpingectomy (LASS), which utilises conventional open surgery equipment without any sealing or coagulation devices and reduces port sites compared to conventional laparoscopy (CL). Fifty-seven consecutive, age-matched patients presenting with a tubal pregnancy were enrolled. In the LASS group, a 10 mm reusable umbilical optical trocar and a 10 mm suprapubic trocar was used. The other 30 patients were managed with multiport CL. All of the patients were asked to use the visual analogue scale and Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale to evaluate their cosmetic satisfaction. The duration of surgery was 21.19 \u00b1 2.33 minutes for the LASS group and 36.9 \u00b1 4.9 minutes for the CL group (p < .001). The postoperative 6th-hour VAS score was 2.44 \u00b1 0.5 for the LASS group and 3.03 \u00b1 0.8 for the CL group (p: .005). All of the PSAS and OSAS parameter scores were significantly lower in LASS group than CL group. In conclusion, the LASS procedure is a feasible method for treating ectopic pregnancies with a shorter surgical duration, lower VAS scores, and better cosmetic scores than CL. Impact statement What is already known on this subject? Laparoscopy or laparotomy may be performed for the surgical management of ectopic pregnancy. Conventional laparoscopy has some advantages such as shorter hospital stay and recovery time and the better cosmetic results. However, the equipment used in conventional laparoscopy and single incision laparoscopy are more expensive than conventional open surgery equipment. What the results of this study add? Laparoscopy-assisted suprapubic salpingectomy (LASS) method has shorter operation time, lower VAS scores, better cosmetic scores and cheaper than conventional laparoscopy. What the implications are of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? The LASS procedure looks like a feasible method for treating ectopic pregnancies and the feasibility of this procedure should be confirmed by a larger series of patients and randomised trials.", "The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of dual localisation with hookwire and lipiodol before needlescopy-assisted resection for pulmonary nodule. Computed tomography-guided dual marking was performed on 36 pulmonary nodules of 32 patients and needlescopy-assisted resection was performed monitored by C-arm fluoroscopy. The mean age of the patients was 58 \u00b1 12 (range 12-77) yrs. The mean size of the nodules was 7.5 \u00b1 3.7 (3-17) mm. Their mean distance from the pleural surface was 7.3 \u00b1 7.5 (0-35) mm. There were nine pure ground-glass opacity lesions, five semi-solid lesions and 22 solid lesions. The time of the dual localisation procedure was 13.1 \u00b1 4.8 (7-23) min. Complications of the marking were pneumothorax in nine patients, and intrapulmonary bleeding in three. One hookwire dislodged during the operation. All nodules were successfully resected under needlescopy without conversion to a conventional thoracoscopy (5 mm or 10 mm thoracoscopy) or a minithoracotomy. There was no complication related to needlescopy-assisted resection. Dual marking with hookwire and lipiodol is a safe and none time consuming procedure, and needlescopy-assisted lung resection for small nodules is technically feasible and useful for histological diagnosis and treatment.", "OBJECTIVE To evaluate the ability of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to inhibit in vitro viral replication and gene expression of feline coronavirus (FCoV). SAMPLE Cell cultures of Crandell-Rees feline kidney cells. PROCEDURES 5 synthetic siRNAs that each targeted a different region of the FCoV genome were tested individually and in various combinations for their antiviral effects against 2 strains of FCoV (feline infectious peritonitis virus WSU 79-1146 and feline enteric coronavirus WSU 79-1683) in cell cultures. Tested combinations targeted the FCoV leader and 3' untranslated region, FCoV leader region and nucleocapsid gene, and FCoV leader region, 3' untranslated region, and nucleocapsid gene. For each test condition, assessments included relative quantification of the inhibition of intracellular viral genomic RNA synthesis by means of real-time, reverse-transcription PCR analysis; flow cytometric evaluation of the reduction of viral protein expression in infected cells; and assessment of virus replication inhibition via titration of extracellular virus with a TCID\u2085\u2080 infectivity assay. RESULTS The 5 siRNAs had variable inhibitory effects on FCoV when used singly. Combinations of siRNAs that targeted different regions of the viral genome resulted in more effective viral inhibition than did individual siRNAs that targeted a single gene. The tested siRNA combinations resulted in approximately 95% reduction in viral replication (based on virus titration results), compared with findings in negative control, nontargeting siRNA-treated, FCoV-infected cells. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE In vitro replication of FCoV was specifically inhibited by siRNAs that targeted coding and noncoding regions of the viral genome, suggesting a potential therapeutic application of RNA interference in treatment of feline infectious peritonitis.", "We investigated the frequency and characteristics of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), the factors associated with the risk of ICH, and outcomes post-ICH overall and by randomized treatment. We identified patients with ICH from the overall trial population enrolled in the Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation trial who received \u22651 dose of the study drug (n = 18 140). ICH was adjudicated by a central committee. Cox regression models were used to identify factors associated with ICH. ICH occurred in 174 patients; most ICH events were spontaneous (71.7%) versus traumatic (28.3%). Apixaban resulted in significantly less ICH (0.33% per year), regardless of type and location, than warfarin (0.80% per year). Independent factors associated with increased risk of ICH were enrollment in Asia or Latin America, older age, prior stroke/transient ischemic attack, and aspirin use at baseline. Among warfarin-treated patients, the median (25th, 75th percentiles) time from most recent international normalized ratio (INR) to ICH was 13 days (6, 21 days). Median INR prior to ICH was 2.6 (2.1, 3.0); 78.5% of patients had a pre-ICH INR <3.0. After ICH, the modified Rankin scale score at discharge was \u22654 in 55.7% of patients, and the overall mortality rate at 30 days was 43.3% with no difference between apixaban- and warfarin-treated patients. ICH occurred at a rate of 0.80% per year with warfarin regardless of INR control and at a rate of 0.33% per year with apixaban and was associated with high short-term morbidity and mortality. This highlights the clinical relevance of reducing ICH by using apixaban rather than warfarin and avoiding concomitant aspirin, especially in patients of older age. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00412984.", "PURPOSE Metal-on-metal total disc replacement is a recent alternative treatment for degenerative disc disease. Wear and corrosion of these implants can lead to local and systemic transport of metal debris. This prospective longitudinal study examined the serum chromium and cobalt levels in 24 patients with cobalt-chromium alloy metal-on-metal lumbar disc replacements. METHODS Serum was assayed for chromium (Cr) and cobalt (Co) using high-resolution inductively-coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Detection limits were 0.015 ng/mL for Cr and 0.04 ng/mL for Co. RESULTS Median serum Co levels at pre-op, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36-months post-op were 0.10, 1.03, 0.96, 0.98, 0.67, and 0.52 ng/mL, respectively. Median serum Cr levels were 0.06, 0.49, 0.65, 0.43, 0.52, and 0.50 ng/mL, respectively. CONCLUSION In general, these results indicated that serum Co and Cr levels are elevated at all postoperative time points and are of the same order of magnitude as those observed in well-functioning metal-on-metal surface replacements of the hip and in metal-on-metal total hip replacements at similar postoperative time points.", " Abdominoplasty, with or without liposuction, is among the most frequently performed aesthetic procedures. Its main objective is to improve the body contour by means of excising redundant skin and fat tissue. Although abdominoplasty is considered a safe procedure with high satisfaction rates, intraoperative and postoperative complications can become a challenge for the surgical team. The aim of this article is to offer a synopsis of the most common complications arising after abdominoplasty, along with evidence-based guidelines about how to prevent and treat them. METHODS A systematic MEDLINE search strategy was designed using appropriate Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms, and references were scanned for further relevant articles. RESULTS According to the published case series, local complications are considerably more common than complications with systemic repercussions. Approximately 10% to 20% of patients suffer a local complication following abdominoplasty, while fewer than 1% suffer a systemic complication. Prevention and management strategies are critically discussed for complications including seroma, haematoma, infection, skin necrosis, suture extrusions, hypertrophic scars, neurological symptoms, umbilical anomalies, deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary thromboembolism, respiratory distress, and death. CONCLUSIONS The complications of abdominoplasty vary in severity and in the impact they have on the aesthetic outcomes. Recommendations for prevention and management are based on various levels of evidence, with a risk of observer bias. However, most complications can be treated appropriately following the current standards, with satisfactory results.", " The current literature describing surgical and endovascular interventions in blister-like aneurysms (BAs) offers no clear consensus on the optimal treatment modality. The aim of this study was to assess the clinical and angiographic features of ruptured BAs treated endovascularly using predominantly flow-diversion strategy. METHODS The initial clinical and radiological findings, endovascular treatment results, clinical outcomes, and follow-up angiographic findings of seven BAs (one man and six women; mean age, 44.5 years; range, 33-50 years) were retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS All seven BAs were located in the supraclinoid internal carotid artery. Two patients were managed initially by other endovascular treatment options, after that flow-diverting strategy became intention to treat in these two and the remaining five patients. Flow-diverting treatment with pipeline stent (Covidien/Ev3) could be accomplished in all but one patient who was treated by parent artery occlusion due to an access problem. Dual antiaggregant loading was performed 6-8 h before treatment in all patients. No re-bleeding or thrombotic complication occurred periprocedurally. Long-term control angiography was available in all patients revealing occluded aneurysm. The clinical outcome (mRS) was good in five and moderate in two patients. CONCLUSIONS Endovascular reconstructive treatment of a ruptured BA using a flow-diverting device is a promising strategy that can be performed with acceptable clinical and good radiological results.", "The outbreak of COVID-19 due to SARS-CoV-2 originally emerged in Wuhan in December, 2019. As of March 22, 2020, the disease had spread to 186 countries, with at least 305,275 confirmed cases. Although there has been a decline in the spread of the disease in China, the prevalence of COVID-19 around the world remains serious despite containment efforts undertaken by national authorities and the international community. In this article, we systematically review the brief history of COVID-19 and its epidemic and clinical characteristics, highlighting the strategies used to control and prevent the disease in China, which may help other countries respond to the outbreak. This pandemic emphasizes the need to be constantly alert to shifts in both the global dynamics and the contexts of individual countries, making sure that all are aware of which approaches are successful for the prevention, containment and treatment of new diseases, and being flexible enough to adapt the responses accordingly.", "PURPOSE Extralevator abdominoperineal excision of the rectum (elAPER) is arguably the modern surgical approach to low rectal cancer and yet results in large defects that may necessitate plastic surgical reconstruction. This study aims to evaluate the quality of prone elAPER surgery with Permacol\u2122 repair of the perineum. The primary end point studied was the rate of primary perineal wound healing. METHODS Data were prospectively collected for consecutive patients having prone elAPER at a single institution to assess surgical morbidity together with pathological and cancer-specific outcomes. RESULTS Between 2006 and 2012, 48 patients had prone elAPER with median age of 63 (40-86). Thirty-four patients (72.3%) received neoadjuvant treatment. Median length of stay was 9 days (6-66). With a prone approach, three patients had specimen perforation (6.4%) and seven patients had circumferential margin involvement (14.9%). Complete perineal wound healing was achieved in 34 patients (73.9%) at 4 weeks. Four patients (8.3%) were unhealed at 6 months; one patient required a perineal sinus to be laid open, and another patient required plastic surgical reconstruction. No perineal wound herniae have been identified during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Acceptable oncological outcomes are achieved with the prone extralevator approach. The technique achieves high rates of primary healing, making it an attractive option in centres without access to plastic reconstructive expertise.", "PURPOSE Chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP) can occur after elective mid/hindfoot and ankle surgery. Effective treatment approaches to prevent the development of CPSP in this population have not been extensively investigated. The impact of multimodal strategies to prevent CPSP following elective mid/hindfoot surgery is unknown because of both the heterogeneity of acute pain management and the lack of a recognized definition particular to this surgery. This review aimed to identify and evaluate current pain management strategies after elective mid/hindfoot and ankle surgery. SOURCES Manual and electronic searches (MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library) were conducted of literature published between 1990 and July 2017. Comparative studies of adults undergoing elective mid/hindfoot and ankle surgery were included. Two reviewers independently reviewed studies and assessed their methodological quality. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS We found seven randomized-controlled trials meeting our inclusion criteria. Interventions focused on regional anesthesia techniques such as continuous popliteal sciatic and femoral nerve blockade. Participants were typically followed up to 48 hr postoperatively. Only one study assessed pain six months following elective mid/hindfoot and ankle surgery. CONCLUSION There is an overwhelming lack of evidence regarding CPSP and its management for patients undergoing elective mid/hindfoot and ankle surgery. The lack of a recognized and standard definition of CPSP after this group of surgeries precludes accurate and consistent evaluation.", "OBJECTIVES We compared the differences between LigaSure Small Jaw\u00ae-assisted and conventional neck dissection in patients with head and neck cancer. DESIGN Prospective randomised study. SETTING Tertiary referral hospital. PARTICIPANTS Patients scheduled to undergo neck dissection due to head and neck cancer were eligible for this study. The study group was treated using the LigaSure vessel sealing system (Small Jaw\u00ae; Covidien, Colorado, USA) for dissection and hemostasis throughout the whole procedures (ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT02597582). MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES Operation duration, perioperative blood loss, postoperative drainage amount and postoperative pain status. RESULTS The study group consisted of 21 patients, while the control group had 20 patients. The operation duration was shorter (97.1 versus 116.3 min, P = 0.022) and the average amount of injected analgesics was lower (8.8 versus 17.7 ampules, P = 0.037) in the study group. CONCLUSIONS The assistance of the LigaSure Small Jaw\u00ae during functional neck dissection shortened the operation duration and decreased the amount of injected analgesics needed.", "Currently, it is necessary to deal with issues related to the emissions as there is a constantly increasing interest in combusting sludge from sewage treatment plants in the boilers for wood. An analysis of the energetic importance of the combustion of sewage sludge has already been carried out, but the effects of various treatments of the sludge are not always clear, e.g. composting and subsequent combustion to the air pollution. Investments in other thermal processes of energetic utilisation of sewage sludge and organic waste are not always successfully implemented. The objective of this paper is to point out some problematic cases for acceptance of thermal processes related to energetic use of waste in terms of the air protection. The other aim is to mention the experience with solutions of such issues in Slovakia. There are mentioned first results of the operational validation experiments during the energy generation in circulating fluidized bed boiler in peaking power plant (Power 110MW) with the addition of the so-called alternative fuel based on wood and sewage sludge to the main fuel - black coal (anthracite). And there has already been achieved the highest share of 12.4%w. (dry matter) of sewage sludge in form of compost in blend with black coal, which is technologically viable. Moreover analyzed the problems of the authorization and operation of the co-combustion of sewage sludge and of combustion of products of various kinds of pyrolysis waste - pyrolysis gas and pyrolysis oil are analyzed.", "OBJECTIVE Endoscopic Zenker diverticulotomy (EZD) is a primary treatment for Zenker diverticulum (ZD). During EZD, the diverticulum is not excised, and interpretation of postoperative videofluoroscopic swallow study (VFSS) is challenging. The purpose of this investigation was to describe normal VFSS findings status post-successful EZD. METHODS The charts of all patients with ZD treated at our center between October 01, 2011, and May 30, 2014, were abstracted. Outcome measures included recidivistic diverticulum size, Eating Assessment Tool-10 (EAT-10), penetration aspiration scale, pharyngeal constriction ratio (PCR), and pharyngoesophageal segment (PES) opening. RESULTS Twenty patients met inclusion criteria. The mean age was 70.5 (\u00b1 13) years. Seventy percent of the patients were male. Mean EAT-10 decreased 72.1% from 17.9 (\u00b1 8.2) to 5 (\u00b1 6.9) (P < 0.0001), and diverticulum size decreased 50.9% from 1.96 cm (\u00b1 0.68) to 0.96 cm (\u00b1 0.57) (P < 0.001). The PCR improved 33.6% from 0.17 (\u00b1 0.13) to 0.11 (\u00b1 0.11) (P < 0.001). Mean PES opening increased 61.6% from 0.53 cm (\u00b1 0.3544) to 0.86 cm (\u00b1 0.29) in lateral view and increased 40.0% from 1.00 cm (\u00b1 0.54) to 1.39 cm (\u00b1 0.46) in anteroposterior view (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION VFSS following successful EZD demonstrates an approximate 50% reduction in diverticulum size and significant improvement in PCR and PES opening. These data provide a framework for the expected fluoroscopic outcomes of successful diverticulotomy. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE 4. Laryngoscope, 127:1762-1766, 2017.", " Laparoscopic fenestration is a standard procedure for the treatment of non-parasitic liver cysts. After fenestration, the remnant liver often restores its volume. However, no systematic analysis of the phenomenon exists. In the present study, the pattern of liver volume restoration after laparoscopic fenestration of liver cysts was analyzed, and the mechanism for the unique restoration was investigated. METHODS Seven patients with giant non-parasitic liver cysts underwent laparoscopic fenestration. Liver volume restoration in each section and changes in the diameter of the portal branch were analyzed after fenestration with CT or MRI. In two patients, regional liver volume restoration was assessed in detail using region-growing software, and change in portal flow distribution was estimated using computational fluid dynamics. Then, the regional liver volume restoration rate was compared with the portal hemodynamic changes. RESULTS Liver volume restoration after fenestration was dependent on the size and position of the cysts; it not uniform throughout the remnant liver. The liver volume restoration in sections that had been compressed by giant cysts was significantly greater than in other areas after fenestration. This volume restoration was accompanied by an increase in the diameters of the portal branches in these sections. In addition, a strong correlation between the regional liver volume restoration rate and the changes in portal flow distribution existed in the computationally analyzed cases. CONCLUSION Liver volume restoration after the fenestration of giant liver cysts non-uniformly occurs in the remnant liver. Improved portal vein circulation in the hepatic area adjacent to the excised giant liver cysts most likely regulates the greater regional volume restoration rate in the area.", " Nutritional management is important throughout the treatment period for esophageal cancer patients. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of percutaneous radiologic gastrostomy (PRG) and to investigate whether PRG can be applied for patients with advanced esophageal cancer. METHODS In this study, 89 patients (74 men and 15 women) with advanced esophageal cancer underwent PRG using computed tomography and fluoroscopic guidance. These patients were unsuitable candidates for endoscopic intervention because of esophageal stricture. Primary placement of a mushroom-retained gastrostomy catheter was intended. The end points were technical success and complications after PRG as well as clinical outcomes and survival of the patients. These end points also were compared between the pre-chemoradiotherapy (pre-CRT) and post-CRT groups using the Chi square test, Fisher's exact test, and the Wilcoxon rank sum test. The survival rate was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. RESULTS All the patients had a successful PRG. The mushroom-tip gastrostomy catheter was primarily inserted in 77 patients (86.5 %) and finally achieved for all the patients. Complications occurred for 14 patients (15.7 %) including Dindo-Clavien classification grade 3 (1 catheter dislodgement), grade 2 (2 gastric hemorrhages), and grade 1 (7 skin infections and 4 oozing hemorrhages) complications. During the follow-up period (median, 6 months), 60 patients (67.4 %) died, giving a 12-month survival rate of 37.7 %. Gastrostomy removal was more common in the pre-CRT group (P = 0.011). The pre-CRT group had higher survival rates than the post-CRT group (P = 0.021). CONCLUSIONS Because PRG provided high technical success with limited complications, it can be used for patients with advanced esophageal cancer whose treatment plan involves multimodal therapy.", "With the development of high-resolution manometry and specific metrics to characterize esophageal motility, the Chicago Classification has become the gold standard for the diagnosis of esophageal motor disorders. Major and significant disorders, that is, never observed in healthy subjects, are achalasia, esophagogastric junction outflow obstruction, distal esophageal spasm, absent peristalsis, and hypercontractile (Jackhammer) esophagus. Achalasia subtyping is relevant to predict the response to endoscopic and surgical therapies as several studies suggest that, pneumatic dilation is less effective than Heller myotomy, in type III achalasia. Peroral endoscopic myotomy, initially developed in expert centers, is a promising technique for the treatment of achalasia. The medical therapeutic options for distal esophageal spasm and hypercontractile esophagus are smooth muscle relaxants and pain modulators. Intraesophageal injection of botulinum toxin might be an interesting option for treatment of these disorders but further studies are required to determine the optimal injection protocol and the best candidates based on manometric patterns. The treatment of hypotensive motility disorders is disappointing and relies mainly on dietary and lifestyle changes as no effective esophageal prokinetic is currently available.", "The hypothesis has been proposed that patients COVID-19 positive, under anti-hypertensive treatment with angiotensin enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor-blockers, might have a worse or a better clinical prognosis. This might be due to the fact that ACE2 is the receptor for the virus to enter human cells, but, on the contrary, that ACE2 expression is downregulated following SARS-1 infection, resulting in disproportionate activation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and exacerbated pneumonia progression. However, no solid clinical data are available at the present moment to support or disprove such hypotheses. We announce in this letter that a large multicentre case-control study has been started in Italy that is the country with a very high impact of COVID-19 infection. We hope that our letter will encourage other clinical centres, even outside Italy, to join our study.", "RATIONALE Laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal (TEP) inguinal hernia repair is a rapidly evolving, minimally invasive treatment modality for inguinal hernia. Compared with open hernia repair, this method requires a smaller incision, has cosmetic advantages, and facilitates rapid recovery and early return to daily activities because of less postoperative pain. Because general anesthesia is essential for TEP hernia repair, it cannot be performed on patients who have an increased risk of developing complications when placed under general anesthesia. PATIENT CONCERNS We report 2 cases of single-port laparoscopic TEP (SP TEP) that were performed using only an abdominal peripheral nerve block (PNB) at our institute. General anesthesia and neuraxial block were dangerous for both patients owing to severe heart failure and severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). DIAGNOSES They were diagnosed with an inguinal hernia requiring surgery. INTERVENTIONS Hence, the anesthesiologist and surgeon decided to attempt a PNB to avoid complications from general anesthesia and allow faster recovery. An ipsilateral transversus abdominis plane block as well as a rectus sheath block and inguinal canal block were administered via ultrasound guidance. OUTCOMES The patients did not report any pain, and no rescue drug was administrated. The operation times were 65 and 62minutes in patients 1 and 2, respectively. No intraoperative complications were noted. Patient 1 was discharged the day after the surgery, whereas patient 2 was discharged on the same day as the surgery. LESSONS TEP hernia repair using abdominal PNB anesthesia seemed to be a safe and feasible technique without causing any additional complications. However, the use of abdominal PNB anesthesia alone for TEP hernia repair as an alternative to general anesthesia requires further investigation using a larger cohort.", "The Closure Fast\u2122 Endovenous Radiofrequency Ablation Catheter is the latest version of a minimally invasive system for the treatment of patients with superficial venous disease. The Closure Fast\u2122 catheter heats the vein wall to 120\u00b0C, causing denaturation of the collagen of the vein wall and contraction of the vessel such that no blood can flow through it. Nearly one million systems have been sold since the product was launched. Many, if not all, patients can be treated under local anesthesia with the Closure Fast\u2122 catheter. Duplex ultrasound reports occlusion rates for the treated vein of 94%-98% at 1 year and 85%-93% at 3 years. The system produces average postoperative pain scores of less than 2 out of 10 on a visual analog score. In the first postoperative week, 76% of patients do not require analgesia. Some 45% of patients return to normal activity on the first postoperative day. Serious complications appear to be rare following the Closure Fast\u2122 procedure. Transient paresthesia occurs in 0.2% of cases, thrombophlebitis in 1%-10%, and thromboembolic events in up to 1.4%, mainly heat-induced thrombosis. Closure Fast\u2122 adds significant costs to treating superficial venous disease but studies have shown it to be cost-effective when used in an office setting.", "OBJECTIVE To assess and develop a monocortical mandibular bone grafting procedure for reconstruction of alveolar cleft. DESIGN Prospective study. SETTING Hokkaido University Hospital. PATIENTS Forty-two consecutive Japanese patients who had been treated for a total of 48 clefts according to a strict clinical protocol. Mean age at bone grafting was 6 years 11 months. INTERVENTIONS Bone grafting was performed by harvesting lateral cortical bone plates from the symphysis and/or body and then placing them on the labial and palatal openings of the alveolar process defect. No particulate bone grafts were packed into the bony cavity. Mean follow-up after bone grafting was 37 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Status of the grafted area and eruption of cleft-adjacent teeth were assessed prospectively using computed tomography and periapical radiography. RESULTS At 6 months postoperatively, computed tomography showed sufficient bone bridge formation at the cleft site in 85.4% of clefts. Periapical radiography showed \u226575% of the root surfaces of cleft-adjacent teeth were covered with spanning bone in 83.3% of clefts. In 92.6% of clefts in which the cleft-adjacent canine was uncovered with bone during follow-up, the canines erupted spontaneously. CONCLUSIONS Monocortical mandibular bone grafting appears extremely effective for sufficient bone bridge formation and facilitation of cleft-adjacent teeth eruption. The procedure is advantageous in that the quantity of bone required per unit volume of cleft defect is relatively reduced, and larger clefts can thus be treated.", "STUDY OBJECTIVE To show a new technique of using single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) equipment in vaginal surgery to create a \"pneumovagina.\" DESIGN Explanatory video demonstrating the technique and intraoperative findings. SETTING University hospital. PATIENT The 68-year-old patient was referred with a vaginal mesh erosion that resulted in abscess formation at the vaginal apex. The patient was symptomatic with an increasingly foul-smelling vaginal discharge for about 1 year. She had a laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy in a remote hospital 22 months before the current operation and had a total abdominal hysterectomy 15 years ago. The, patient's history was uneventful without dyspareunia, incontinence or voiding difficulties, and she was otherwise content with the sacrocolpopexy result. The local institutional review board granted exemption for this publication. INTERVENTION Frequently, pelvic organ prolapse can only be effectively treated if the surgical procedure comprises support of the central compartment. Laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy shows superior outcomes for this indication, with success rates of up to 96%. However, a rare side effect of laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy is mesh erosion, occurring in up to 2.4% [1]. These erosions are usually treated laparoscopically [2]. In this video we show an alternative route for excision of a symptomatic exposed mesh by using a transvaginal approach: The SILS trocar is used vaginally for abscess irrigation and mesh excision with minimally invasive instruments. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS For treatment of the abscess and removal of the exposed mesh, the SILS trocar was placed vaginally, and laparoscopic instruments were used. The abscess was incised, cleansed and irrigated, debrided, and the mesh excised. Because no mesh material was exposed after excision, the vagina was not closed to avoid creating a cavity with the risk of promoting reabscess formation, and secondary wound healing was anticipated. Laparoscopy was used to confirm that no intra-abdominal lesion coexisted or occurred. There were no signs of further infection of the residual mesh beyond the area exposed in the vagina. The patient's only symptom was foul-smelling discharge, but no back pain or signs of systemic inflammation were found. Knowing that foreign body (mesh) infection usually needs to be treated by complete mesh removal, we did not have any clues of distant mesh infection and counseled the patient that if reinfection occurred a second surgery might be necessary. Nevertheless, we treated this patient with abscess drainage and removal of large parts of the mesh. Thus, the operation was not extended to a complete mesh excision to prevent major surgery and the risk of recurrent prolapse. Particularly, the area of the mesh excision was inspected with the rendezvous technique (light source vaginally, laparoscopic pelvic view with laparoscopic light source switched off) to identify the area of mesh excision from the intra-abdominal area. Sigmoid and rectum were distant to this area, suggesting that no bowel lesion occurred. No complications occurred in the postoperative course. In the follow-up visit 6 months postoperatively the patient was asymptomatic, and the vaginal examination was uneventful with no recurrent erosion. Although improved oversight and richness of detail achieved by the vaginal SILS method is helpful in patients like our case with a suspended vaginal vault, its costs need to be balanced against conventional vaginal approaches (e.g., use of a Lonestar retractor). CONCLUSION The SILS trocar and laparoscope used (SILS Port; Covidien, New Haven, CT) vaginally provide a magnificent and detailed view to allow for exact preparation by means of microinvasive instruments in vaginal surgery, even more in patients with a suspended vaginal vault where access to the apex can be tricky. The \"pneumovagina\" created by CO2 insufflation further helps to expose the vaginal apex. The rendezvous technique can additionally be used to identify intra-abominal lesions.", "Purulent meningitis as a rare complication following laparoscopic ventral rectopexy: suspected etiopathogenesis and treatment.", " The number of obese and morbidly obese patients within the developed world is dramatically increasing within the last 20 years. Apart from demographical changes, obese patients are especially prone to have oestrogen-dependent morbidities and neoplasias, of which laparoscopic treatment should be the standard of care. The increasing number of patients with BMI >40 is concerning, making it necessary to summarise considerations for safe and effective Gynaecological Laparoscopic Surgery. CONSIDERATIONS The sequel to successful laparoscopic surgery in obese patients comprises an interdisciplinary appreciation of laparoscopy. Preoperatively, anaesthetics and medical review are suggested to optimise treatment of comorbidities (i.e. infections and blood sugar levels). Positioning of the patient should consider anti-slip options and pannus fixation to ease laparoscopic access and decrease pressure to the chest. There is no standard port placement in obese patients and landmarks have to be the bony structures of the pelvis and ribs. Retraction of the bowel is essential and mobilisation of the sigmoid with fan retractors or endoloops can accomplish adequate vision. 30\u00b0 scopes can be considered for vision \"around the obstacle\". An experienced assistant with anticipation of surgical steps is favourable for successful surgery completion. Intra-operatively, good surgical techniques are essential. Vessel sealing systems reduce the need for instrument changes and may be helpful in following visualised tissue planes. A transvaginal vault closure may be advantageous compared to laparoscopic closure and Endostiches may be preferred to close the fascia of large trocar sites under vision.", "OBJECTIVES The Trellis thrombectomy system (Covidien) is one of the newer devices that incorporates isolated pharmacomechanical thrombectomy and thrombolysis (PMT) for treatment of deep venous thrombosis (DVT). We conducted a retrospective review of patients with upper- and lower-extremity DVT managed with the Trellis thrombectomy system at our center. METHODS All patients with symptomatic DVT who presented to our center between April 2010 and April 2011 who underwent PMT by the Trellis device were included in this retrospective review. RESULTS Twenty-eight patients (mean age, 46.4 \u00b1 21.2 years) presented with symptoms with a mean duration of 1.3 \u00b1 1.8 months. Eighty-six percent had 100% occlusion on admission, while 14.3% had 70%-90% stenosis. The mean lytic dose used was tPA 20.7 \u00b1 12 mg. The mean Trellis treatment time was 25.1 \u00b1 11.5 minutes. Grade 3 lysis was achieved in 23 of 28 patients (85.8%), while grade 2 lysis was achieved in 14.2%. Mean total hospital stay was 2.6 \u00b1 2.7 days. Postprocedure symptom resolution was 100%, and there was no reocclusion in 78.6% of patients at 1 year. At 12 months, the patency rate (primary or secondary) was 80% as determined by Doppler ultrasound. CONCLUSIONS In patients with DVT involving the ilio-femoral and the upper-extremity vessels, the use of the Trellis device was associated with a high technical success rate as well as a satisfactory 12-month patency rate. Moreover, this strategy was associated with reduced lytic dose, shorter treatment time and hospital stay, and no bleeding complications.", " Open Achilles tendon surgery with the patient in the supine position potentially avoids the complications of the prone position, but the safety and viability of the supine position for this procedure are not known. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that supine positioning for open repair of acute Achilles tendon ruptures would be safe, with low wound and neurologic complication rates. METHODS Supine position safety in acute Achilles tendon repair was investigated. Consecutive cases of supine Achilles tendon surgical repair performed by one surgeon from 2010 to 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were included if they were surgically treated with primary repair in the supine position within 15 days of injury and did not undergo concomitant surgery. A paramedian incision 1 cm medial to the Achilles sheath was used. Initial chart review identified 161 patients who underwent any type of Achilles tendon surgery in the supine position, of whom 45 patients met the inclusion criteria. This group included 39 men and 6 women with an average age of 41 years (range, 20-66 years). Median length of follow-up was 116 days (range, 25-1,589 days). Average body mass index was 29 kg/m2 (range, 23-36 kg/m2). RESULTS There were no infections, sural nerve injuries, or reruptures. CONCLUSIONS The supine position was safe for primary open Achilles tendon repair, with no wound or neurologic complications. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Level IV, case series.", "CONTEXT Few data are available on pregnancy outcomes in women with acromegaly. STUDY DESIGN This was a retrospective multicenter study. PATIENTS The study included 46 women with GH-secreting pituitary microadenomas (n = 7) or macroadenomas (n = 39). Their mean age was 31.7 yr (\u00b14.5 yr). Incomplete transsphenoidal surgical resection (n = 39) and pituitary radiation (n = 14) had been performed, respectively, 2.9 \u00b1 2.6 and 7.3 \u00b1 4.2 yr before pregnancy. The patients were receiving dopamine agonists (n = 25) and/or somatostatin analogs (n = 14), and GH/IGF-I hypersecretion was controlled and uncontrolled in, respectively, 23 and 34 cases. Five pregnancies followed the fertility treatment. RESULTS Fifty-nine pregnancies resulted in 64 healthy babies. Gestational diabetes and gravid hypertension occurred in four (6.8%) and eight (13.6%) pregnancies, respectively, and both were more frequent when GH/IGF-I hypersecretion was not controlled before pregnancy. Visual field defects were diagnosed during pregnancy in four women, three of whom were diagnosed with acromegaly during the pregnancy. Seven women had isolated headache. Magnetic resonance imaging performed 3.9 \u00b1 0.3 months after delivery showed that the size of the adenoma had increased in three cases, decreased in two cases, and remained stable in 22 cases. Seventeen women breast-fed with no complications. Four women gave birth to a small-for-gestational-age infant; all had received somatostatin analogs, alone or in combination with dopamine agonists, during pregnancy. The mean IGF-I level fell significantly during the first trimester in 12 cases (before conception 588 \u00b1 207 ng/ml, first trimester 319 \u00b1 126 ng/ml, P = 0.002), whereas the GH concentration did not change significantly. CONCLUSION The following conclusions were reached: 1) pregnancy in women with active or uncontrolled acromegaly may be associated with an increased risk of gestational diabetes and gravid hypertension; 2) pregnancy is occasionally associated with symptomatic enlargement of GH-secreting pituitary macroadenomas; 3) changes in serum GH and IGF-I concentrations are variable during pregnancy, indicating that routine monitoring is not mandatory if the pregnancy is uneventful; and 4) GH-suppressive treatment can be safely withdrawn after conception in most acromegalic women.", " Casts are used to treat clubfeet, developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH), forearm fractures, and femur fractures. The ability of a cast to maintain a desired shape is termed moldability. Clinicians use plaster, fiberglass, and soft casts. To our knowledge the biomechanical molding characteristics of these 3 materials have never been reported. We hypothesized that moldability of plaster would be better than fiberglass and fiberglass would be better than soft cast. METHODS We compared 12.7 cm wide casts of plaster, fiberglass, and soft cast. Casts were 5 layers thick, prepared in 40\u00b0C water, and placed over 2 layers of cotton padding on 5.1 cm and 15.2 cm diameter foam cylinders. A loading device simulated loads applied by clinicians when molding casts for 4 conditions: clubfoot (thumb-shaped 50 N load on 5.1 cm model), DDH (thumb-shaped 100 N load on 15.2 cm model), forearm fracture (palm-shaped 50 N load on 5.1 cm model), and femur fracture (palm-shaped 100 N load on 15.2 cm model). The loading device applied molding for 7 minutes. Five casts of each material were made for each model. Casts were removed, photographed, and the area of maximal deformation was compared with an unmolded cast. A large area of maximal deformation meant that the deformation was spread out over a large area, less precise molding. RESULTS In the clubfoot model, plaster was more precise than fiberglass (P=0.002) and soft cast (P<0.0001). In the DDH model, plaster was more precise than fiberglass (P<0.0001) and soft cast (P<0.0001) and fiberglass was more precise than soft cast (P<0.0001).In the femur fracture model, plaster was more precise than fiberglass (P=0.001) and soft cast (P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS The moldability of plaster is better than fiberglass and soft cast and fiberglass is better than soft cast. CLINICAL RELEVANCE If precise molding is required, plaster has the best moldability. In cases not requiring precise molding, fiberglass and soft cast are lightweight, waterproof, and available in child-friendly colors.", "OBJECTIVE The objective of this study is to report our experience and illustrate our technique in the use of fibrin glue in the treatment of post-operatory cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks and collections following different neurosurgical procedures. METHODS In a 3-year period, 40 subjects underwent endoscopic endonasal approach for different sellar and skull base lesions (three tuberculum sellae meningiomas, six craniopharyngiomas, three Rathke's cleft cysts and 28 pituitary macroadenomas), in which an intraoperative CSF leakage was evident. In such subjects, the fibrin glue was used as a first step of the final phase of the procedure-i.e. the reconstruction of the skull base defect-followed by the other materials employed. Furthermore, ten other patients, who had undergone transsphenoidal (four cases), spinal (two cases), posterior fossa (three cases) and transcortical intraventricular tumour removal (one case) neurosurgical procedures and developed CSF leaks or collections, were conservatively treated by single or repeated in situ injections of \"modified\" fibrin glue under local anaesthesia according to different described techniques. In total, 50 patients constitute the clinical material of the present study. TECHNIQUE In the cases where the fibrin glue was used during the reconstruction phase of the procedure (40 cases), the glue was injected inside the tumour cavity to fill the dead space left by the removal of the lesion. In case of post-operative CSF leak or CSF fluid collection (ten cases), after discarding 50-80% of the thrombin solution to obtain prevalence of the product's adhesive properties, fibrin glue was injected directly in the path of the CSF leak or into the collection cavity after aspiration of the collection's content. This was performed with the provided application system or through lumbar or Tuohy needles. Applications were repeated every 48 h until the disappearance of the leak. In all the treated cases, the disappearance of CSF leaks or collections was obtained with a number of applications ranging from one to five. Successful results are stable with a follow-up ranging from 6 months to 3 years. CONCLUSIONS In our experience, the injection of fibrin glue has proved to be effective in filling or sealing post-operative \"dead spaces\" and treating minor or initial CSF leaks resulting from procedures of transsphenoidal, cranial and spinal surgery, adding another possibility in the management of many of these dreadful complications.", "OBJECTIVES To determine the accuracy of sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection in vulval carcinoma and to report the reliability and safety of this procedure. METHODS/MATERIALS For a period of 6 years, we recruited women undergoing surgery for vulval carcinoma. All women had a preoperative biopsy confirming the depth of invasion greater than 1 mm. Sentinel lymph node detection was performed using the combined method (Tc-99m and methylene-blue dye). The standard management included complete inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy. When inguinofemoral lymph nodes were found grossly to be enlarged, these nodes were debulked, and the women subsequently treated with radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy. During the last 2 years of the study, a selected group of women had an SLN dissection alone. The SLNs were ultrastaged when they were negative on routine hematoxylin and eosin examination. RESULTS Among 60 women undergoing SLN detection, SLN was detected in 59 women (98.3%) with combined method. Blue dye did not detect an SLN in 3 women resulting in a 93.3% detection rate. The median SLN count was 2 nodes (range, 1-9). Of the 60 women, 41 had inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy, 4 had only enlarged inguinofemoral nodes debulked, and 15 had the SLN only removed. The non-SLN count was 9 nodes (range, 3-17). There were no false-negative SLNs. Twenty-one women (35%) had positive nodes on final histology. Ultrastaging increased detection of metastases in 6.9% of nodes relative to routine hematoxylin and eosin examination and upstaged 12% of women. The median follow-up was 24 months (range, 2-66 months). CONCLUSIONS Sentinel lymph node detection is safe and accurate in assessing lymph node status in women with vulval cancer undergoing staging. The combined method using Tc-99m and methylene blue dye injection for SLN detection has the best detection rate. Routine ultrastaging of negative SLN improves the detection of nodal metastases.", "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has emerged as one of the greatest challenges faced by humankind in the recent past. People with diabetes and related comorbidities are at increased risk of its complications and of COVID-19-related death. Older age, multi-morbidity, hyperglycaemia, cardiac injury and severe inflammatory response are predictors of poor outcome. The complex interplay between COVID-19, diabetes and the effects of related therapies is being explored. Most patients experience a mild illness with COVID-19, while people with diabetes are at increased risk of severe disease. Optimising glycaemic control and adopting measures to prevent disease spread are critical aspects. The management of mild disease is supportive, while very many immunomodulatory and antiviral therapies are being investigated for the treatment of severe disease. Several of these agents have specific considerations for use in people with diabetes. Since mass population lockdowns are considered a key step in controlling disease spread, it follows that, in addition to the direct vulnerability to severe COVID-19, people with diabetes can be affected by limited access to healthcare, insulin, other medications and blood glucose monitoring equipment. Measures to prevent disease spread at the individual and community level are the key to mitigating the rapidly escalating pandemic, while agents for chemoprophylaxis and vaccines are being explored. People with diabetes should be recognised as a vulnerable group for complicated disease and are at risk during times of disturbed social systems. Strategies are needed to safeguard the health of patients with diabetes during the pandemic. This review summarises the current knowledge and perceived challenges for prevention and management of COVID-19 in people with diabetes.", "OBJECTIVE Carotid cavernous fistula (CCF) development after Pipeline Embolization Device (PED) treatment of cavernous carotid aneurysms (CCA) can be a challenging pathology to treat for the neurointerventionalist. METHODS A database of all patients whose aneurysms were treated with the PED since its approval by the Food and Drug Administration in 2011 was retrospectively reviewed. Demographic information, aneurysm characteristics, treatment technique, antiplatelet regimen, and follow-up data were collected. A literature review of all papers that describe PED treatment of CCA was then completed. RESULTS A total of 44 patients with 45 CCAs were identified (38 women, 6 men). The mean age was 59.9\u00b19.0 years. The mean maximal aneurysm diameter was 15.9\u00b16.9 mm (mean neck 7.1\u00b13.6 mm). A single PED was deployed in 32 patients, with two PEDs deployed in 10 patients and three PEDs in 3 patients. Adjunctive coiling was performed in 3 patients. Mean follow-up duration based on final imaging (MR angiography or digital subtraction angiography) was 14.1\u00b112.2 months. Five patients (11.4%) developed CCFs in the post-procedural period after PED treatment, all within 2 weeks of device placement. These CCFs were treated with a balloon test occlusion followed by parent artery sacrifice. Our literature review yielded only three reports of CCFs after PED placement, with the largest series having a CCF rate of 2.3%. CONCLUSIONS CCF formation is a known risk of PED treatment of CCA. Although transvenous embolization can be used for treating CCFs, parent artery sacrifice remains a viable option on the basis of these data. Studies support the view that adjunctive coiling may have a protective effect against post-PED CCF formation. None of the coiled aneurysms in our database or in the literature have ruptured. Follow-up data will lead to a better understanding of the safety profile of the PED for CCA.", "OBJECTIVES Prognosis for patients with locally advanced esophagogastric adenocarcinoma (EAC) is poor with surgery alone, and adjuvant therapy after open esophagectomy is frequently not tolerated. After minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE); however, earlier return to normal function may render patients better able to receive adjuvant therapy. We examined whether primary MIE followed by adjuvant chemotherapy influenced survival compared with propensity-matched patients treated with neoadjuvant therapy. METHODS Patients with stage II or higher EAC treated with MIE (N = 375) were identified. Using 30 pretreatment covariates, propensity for assignment to either neoadjuvant followed by MIE (n = 183; 54%) or MIE as primary therapy (n = 156; 46%) was calculated, generating 97 closely matched pairs. Hazard ratios were adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, smoking, comorbidity, and final pathologic stage. RESULTS In propensity-matched pairs, adjusted hazard ratio for death did not differ significantly for primary MIE compared with neoadjuvant (hazard ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.60-1.16). Recurrence patterns were similar between groups and 65% of patients with IIb or greater pathologic stage received adjuvant therapy. Clinical staging was inaccurate in 37 out of 105 patients (35%) who underwent primary MIE (n = 18 upstaged and n = 19 downstaged). CONCLUSIONS Primary MIE followed by adjuvant chemotherapy guided by pathologic findings did not negatively influence survival and allowed for accurate staging compared with clinical staging. Our data suggest that primary MIE in patients with resectable EAC may be a reasonable approach, improving stage-based prognostication and potentially minimizing overtreatment in patients with early stage disease through accurate stage assignments. A randomized controlled trial testing this hypothesis is needed.", "OBJECTIVES Clinical Practice Guidelines for Pancreatic Cancer based on Evidence-Based Medicine 2006 were first published by the Japan Pancreas Society, and they were revised to Clinical Practice Guidelines for Pancreatic Cancer 2009 in July 2009 and were further revised to Clinical Practice Guidelines for Pancreatic Cancer 2013 in October 2013. These guidelines were established according to evidence-based medicine. In October 2016, the Clinical Practice Guidelines for Pancreatic Cancer were newly revised in Japanese. METHODS In the revised version, we introduced the concepts of GRADE - grading recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation approach for better understanding of the current guidelines. RESULTS The guidelines show algorithms for the diagnosis, treatment, and chemotherapy of pancreatic cancer and address 7 subjects: diagnosis, surgical therapy, adjuvant therapy, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, stent therapy, and palliative medicine. They include 51 clinical questions and 76 statements. There are statements corresponding to clinical questions, evidence levels, recommended strengths, and agreement rates. CONCLUSIONS These guidelines represent the most standard clinical and practical management at this time in Japan. This is the English synopsis of the Clinical Practice Guidelines for Pancreatic Cancer 2016 in Japanese, which aims to disseminate the Japanese guidelines worldwide for the introduction of Japanese clinical management of these diseases.", " We describe a patient with a large cystic adenomyosis of the uterus who was treated by a laparoscopic approach. CASE PRESENTATION A 38-year-old woman presented with dysmenorrhoea for 4 months. A 104 mm \u00d7 55 mm \u00d7 60 mm cystic mass was detected on the right side of the posterior wall of the uterus by ultrasound. Laparoscopy was performed, during which a bumpy mass was discovered protruding from the surface of the uterine myometrium. Both ovaries were normal. When the wall of the cystic mass was opened, chocolate-colored fluid was visible. The cyst was completely removed, and postoperative histopathology confirmed a cystic adenomyosis. One month later, the uterus was found to be normal on ultrasound. DISCUSSION Endometriosis is a common disease in women and is divided into ovarian endometrioid cysts, superficial endometriosis, deep infiltrating endometriosis and other special types according to pathological characteristics. As a special type of endometriosis, the incidence of cystic adenomyosis is low, and its specific incidence is unknown. Cystic adenomyosis is clinically characterized by the appearance of one or more cystic cavities between the walls of the uterine muscles. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic surgery is an effective method for the diagnosis and treatment of large cystic masses in the uterine myometrium.", "Adenomyosis of the uterus is defined as the presence of endometrial tissue, including glands and stroma, situated at least 2.5 mm below the endometrial-myometrial junction and widely distributed within the myometrium layer of the uterus. There is no consensus on the appropriate treatment for symptomatic uterine adenomyosis in women who want to preserve their uterus, partly because adenomyosis is somewhat enigmatic in diagnosis and owing to its clinical significance. Hysterectomy, through either exploratory laparotomy or minimally invasive procedures, is a definite treatment for uterine adenomyosis, once the women have completed childbirth or do not require future fertility. However, many women with a uterine pathology still have a strong desire to preserve the uterus, for which conservative and uterine-sparing procedures are increasingly used, and with which fertility preservation or quality-of-life improvement can be achieved. Although medical management can be effective, similar to the management of uterine fibroids (myoma), its effect is often transient and rapid regrowth of adenomyosis and relapse of symptoms and signs always occur once the treatment is stopped. Therefore, other strategies should be selected. Conservative and uterine-sparing surgery might be one of the most familiar procedures of these uterine-sparing procedures. In this article, the latest knowledge and research evidence on uterine-sparing surgery for uterine adenomyosis are reviewed.", " Minimally invasive laparoscopic surgical procedures are increasingly being used for the management of vesicoureteral reflux. OBJECTIVE We present our experience of the laparoscopic Politano-Leadbetter technique performed under pneumovesicum conditions, which allows an orthotopic ureteral location after vesicoureteral reflux correction. Our procedure recreates the new ureteric orifice in a normal anatomical position with potential less morbidity and better cosmesis. STUDY DESIGN Our series comprises ten cases. The three 5 mm ports were introduced through bladder wall under cystoscopic vision. A 5-0 monofilament traction suture was used and dissection was carried out. After the ureteral mobilization, the location of the new hiatus was selected in a straight line superior to the original orifice. Dissection of the submucosal tunnel was started from the new hiatus and advanced to the original hiatus and the ureter was gently drawn passed through the tunnel. The ureter was rolled up and muscle fibers were incised until ureter could freely move from the base of the new hiatus. Finally, after spatulation of the terminal part of the ureter, ureterovesical anastomosis was performed with intracorporeal suturing using 5-0 monofilament sutures. RESULTS The average operative time was 125 min, with an average of 93 min for unilateral and 133 min for bilateral reimplantation. Blood loss was minimal and drains were used selectively. Removal of urethral catheter was decided empirically after hematuria stopped. Mean catheterization time was 5.1 days. The mean postoperative hospital stay was 6.2 days. DISCUSSION This study had limitations: the small number of cases, follow-up period is relatively short and data on the pre-operative bladder capacity, catheter-related morbidity, pain control and cosmesis are lacking. But most cases showed positive clinical results including acceptable operating time and good resolution rate with minimal complication. Our Politano-Leadbetter transvesicoscopic ureteric reimplantation is safe and useful in the resolution of VUR, even though the laparoscopic ureteric reimplantation is technically demanding even for experienced pediatric surgeons. Considering the main advantages of endoscopic surgery, our new vesicoscopic technique could be an optional treatment to the open reimplantation and has merits because whole the procedure are performed within the bladder, so there is no risk of intraperitoneal organ injury. CONCLUSION Though the role of this new technique in the treatment of VUR remains to be determined, the technique could be an optional treatment to replace other surgical methods as a less invasive and effective therapeutic method.", "By collecting photons scattered out of the therapy beam, scatter imaging creates images of the treated volume. Two phantoms were used to assess the possible application of scatter imaging for markerless tracking of lung tumors during stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) treatment. A scatter-imaging camera was assembled with a CsI flat-panel detector and a 5 mm diameter pinhole collimator. Scatter images were collected during the irradiation of phantoms with megavoltage photons. To assess scatter image quality, spherical phantom lung tumors of 2.1 - 2.8 cm diameters were placed inside a static, anthropomorphic phantom. To show the efficacy of the technique with a moving target (3 cm diameter), the position of a simulated tumor was tracked in scatter images during sinusoidal motion (15 mm amplitude, 0.25 Hz frequency) in a dynamic lung phantom in open-field, dynamic conformal arc (DCA), and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) deliveries. Anatomical features are identifiable on static phantom scatter images collected with 10 MU of delivered dose (2.1 cm diameter lung tumor contrast-to-noise ratio of 4.4). The contrast-to-noise ratio increases with tumor size and delivered dose. During dynamic motion, the position of the 3.0 cm diameter lung tumor was identified with a root-mean-square error of 0.8, 1.2, and 2.9 mm for open field (0.3 s frame integration), DCA (0.5 s), and VMAT (0.5 s), respectively. Based on phantom studies, scatter imaging is a potential technique for markerless lung tumor tracking during SBRT without additional imaging dose. Quality scatter images may be collected at low, clinically relevant doses (10 MU). Scatter images are capable of sub-millimeter tracking precision, but modulation decreases accuracy.", " Fusiform dissecting aneurysms involving the dominant vertebral artery with poor collaterals are challenging to treat. The purpose of this study was to present an initial experience with a fill and tunnel technique for reconstructive endovascular treatment of these conditions. METHODS A total of 13 patients, 11 men and 2 women, each with a fusiform vertebral artery dissecting aneurysm not amenable to internal trapping of the parent artery, underwent reconstructive endovascular treatment using a fill and tunnel technique between January 2012 and December 2015. The safety, feasibility, and clinical and angiographic outcomes of these procedures were retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS The average maximum diameter of the fusiform aneurysms was 12.1 mm. Five were ruptured. Three aneurysms were treated with a single stent and the remaining 10 aneurysms required double-stent placement. Treatment was technically successful in all 13 patients, achieving complete occlusion ( n = 10, 76.9%) and near-complete occlusion ( n = 3, 23.1%). No procedure-related complications occurred in any patient. There were no delayed thromboembolic or hemorrhagic complications during the follow-up period (mean, 19.0 months). Angiographic follow-ups (mean, 9.1 months) showed stable occlusion in 90.9% (10/11) and asymptomatic in-stent occlusion in one patient (9.1%, 1/11). At the end of the observation period (mean, 19.0 months), all patients had excellent clinical outcomes (modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 0, 92.3%, 12/13), except one (mRS 4), resulting from poor preoperative status. CONCLUSIONS This retrospective study demonstrated that endovascular reconstruction using a fill-and-tunnel technique was a technically safe, feasible, and clinically effective treatment method for fusiform vertebral artery dissecting aneurysms with ipsilateral dominance.", " AND PURPOSE The Low-Profile Visualized Intraluminal Support (LVIS) stent is a new device recently introduced for the treatment of wide-neck intracranial aneurysms. This single-center study presents the authors' preliminary experience using the LVIS stent to treat saccular aneurysms with parent arteries smaller than 2.5 mm. MATERIALS AND METHODS Aneurysms with a LVIS stent used in a small parent vessel (<2.5 mm in diameter) between October 2014 and April 2016 were included. Procedure-related complications, angiographic results, clinical outcomes, and midterm follow-up data were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS A total of 22 patients was studied, including 5 ruptured and 17 unruptured aneurysms. Most of the aneurysms were located in the anterior circulation (90.9%). Stent placement in the parent arteries measuring 1.7-2.4 mm in diameter (mean, 2.1 mm) was successful in 100% of cases. Procedure-related complication developed in 1 patient (4.5%) who presented with aneurysm rupture. No permanent morbidity and mortality occurred. Immediate angiographic outcome showed complete occlusion in 8 aneurysms (36.4%), neck residual in 8 (36.4%), and residual aneurysm in 6 (27.3%). All patients underwent angiographic follow-up at a mean of 8.3 months, which revealed complete occlusion in 18 (81.8%) patients, neck remnant in 3 (13.6%), and residual sac in 1 (4.5%). No recanalization of the target aneurysm was observed. There was 1 case with asymptomatic in-stent stenosis. CONCLUSIONS Our preliminary results show that the deployment of LVIS stents in small vessels is feasible, safe, and effective in the midterm. Larger studies with long-term follow-up are needed to validate our promising results.", "Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection causes severe liver disease in millions of humans worldwide. Pathogenesis of HCV infection is strongly driven by a deficient immune response of the host, although intersection of different aspects of the virus life cycle with cellular homeostasis is emerging as an important player in the pathogenesis and progression of the disease. Cryo soft X-ray tomography (cryo-SXT) was performed to investigate the ultrastructural alterations induced by the interference of HCV replication with cellular homeostasis. Native, whole cell, three-dimensional (3D) maps were obtained in HCV replicon-harboring cells and in a surrogate model of HCV infection. Tomograms from HCV-replicating cells show blind-ended endoplasmic reticulum tubules with pseudospherical extrusions and marked alterations of mitochondrial morphology that correlated spatially with the presence of endoplasmic reticulum alterations, suggesting a short-range influence of the viral machinery on mitochondrial homeostasis. Both mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum alterations could be reverted by a combination of sofosbuvir/daclatasvir, which are clinically approved direct-acting antivirals for the treatment of chronic HCV infection. In addition to providing structural insight into cellular aspects of HCV pathogenesis, our study illustrates how cryo-SXT is a powerful 3D wide-field imaging tool for the assessment and understanding of complex cellular processes in a setting of near-native whole hydrated cells. Our results also constitute a proof of concept for the use of cryo-SXT as a platform that enables determining the potential impact of candidate compounds on the ultrastructure of the cell that may assist drug development at a preclinical level.", "Hip fractures are common orthopedic injuries and are associated with significant morbidity/mortality. Intraoperative normothermia is recommended by national guidelines to minimize additional morbidity/mortality, but limited evidence exists regarding hypothermia's effect on orthopedic patients. The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of intraoperative hypothermia in patients with operatively treated hip fractures and evaluate its effect on complications and outcomes. Retrospective chart review was performed on clinical records from 1541 consecutive patients who sustained a hip fracture and underwent operative fixation at the authors' institution between January 2005 and October 2013. A total of 1525 patients were included for analysis, excluding those with injuries requiring additional surgical intervention. Patient demographic data, surgery-specific data, postoperative complications, length of stay, and 30-day readmission were recorded. Patients with a mean intraoperative temperature less than 36\u00b0C were identified as hypothermic. Statistical analysis with univariate and multivariate logistic regression modeling evaluated associations with hypothermia and effect on complications/outcomes. The incidence of intraoperative hypothermia in operatively treated hip fractures was 17.0%. Hypothermia was associated with an increase in the rate of deep surgical-site infection (odds ratio, 3.30; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-9.14; P=.022). Lower body mass index and increasing age demonstrated increased association with hypothermia (P=.004 and P=.005, respectively). To the authors' knowledge, this is the first and largest study analyzing the effect of intraoperative hypothermia in orthopedic patients. In patients with hip fractures, the study's findings confirm evidence found in other surgical specialties that hypothermia may be associated with an increased risk of deep surgical-site infection and that lower body mass index and increasing age are risk factors for intraoperative hypothermia. [Orthopedics. 2016; 39(6):e1170-e1177.].", "Renal sympathetic denervation is currently performed in the treatment of resistant hypertension by interventionists who otherwise do not typically use radiofrequency (RF) energy ablation in their clinical practice. Adequate RF lesion formation is dependent upon good electrode-tissue contact, power delivery, electrode-tissue interface temperature, target-tissue impedance and the size of the catheter's active electrode. There is significant interplay between these variables and hence an appreciation of the biophysical determinants of RF lesion formation is required to provide effective and safe clinical care to our patients. In this review article, we summarize the biophysics of RF ablation and explain why and how complications of renal sympathetic denervation may occur and discuss methods to minimise them.", "OBJECTIVES This study sought to investigate the effect of treatment delay on microvascular reperfusion in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients from the large, multicenter, prospective HORIZONS-AMI (Harmonizing Outcomes with Revascularization and Stents in Acute Myocardial Infarction) trial.  Despite restoration of epicardial blood flow during primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), one-third of patients do not obtain myocardial perfusion due to impairment in the microvascular circulation. METHODS We examined the effect of symptom onset-to-balloon time (SBT) and door-to-balloon time (DBT) on myocardial reperfusion during primary PCI in STEMI, utilizing resolution of ST-segment elevation (STR) and the myocardial blush grade (MBG). The primary analysis was the relationships between SBT \u22642, >2 to 4, and >4 h and DBT \u22641, >1 to 1.5, >1.5 to 2, and >2 h with MBG and STR. Clinical risk was assessed using a modified version of the Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction risk score for STEMI. RESULTS In 2,056 patients, absent microvascular perfusion (MBG 0/1) and STR (STR <30%) after primary PCI was significantly more common in patients with longer SBT, in patients with both low and high clinical risk profiles. By multivariable analysis, SBT (p < 0.0001), anterior infarction (p < 0.0001), reference vessel diameter (p = 0.005), lesion minimum lumen diameter (p < 0.0001), hyperlipidemia (p = 0.03), and current smoking (p = 0.001) were independent predictors of MBG 0/1, whereas SBT (p = 0.007), anterior infarction (p < 0.0001), and history of renal insufficiency (p = 0.0002) were independent predictors of absent STR. DBT (p < 0.0001) was an independent predictor of MBG 0/1. MBG 0/1 and STR<30% identified patients with increased 3-year mortality. CONCLUSIONS The present study suggests that delay in mechanical reperfusion therapy during STEMI is associated with greater injury to the microcirculation.", " AND IMPORTANCE Ethmoidal arteriovenous fistulae (AVF) are uncommon and are characterized by an aggressive clinical course. Typical venous drainage is into the frontal cortical veins. We present the case of a 76-year-old male patient who was found to have a right ethmoidal AVF draining directly into the superior ophthalmic vein (SOV), with no cavernous sinus involvement and an associated SOV aneurysm and was successfully treated using surgical cutdown of the SOV followed by endovascular embolization. CLINICAL PRESENTATION A 76-year-old man presented with chemosis, proptosis, and lid lag with occasional diplopia. Based on the clinical presentation, there was a suspicion of a carotid cavernous fistula. Cerebral angiography demonstrated a right ethmoidal to SOV fistula, without any involvement of the cavernous sinus, and a SOV aneurysm. Transarterial embolization of the fistula was attempted but was unsuccessful. An SOV approach was performed using SOV cutdown followed by endovascular embolization of the fistula from a transocular route using coils and Onyx embolic agent. There was complete obliteration of the fistula and associated venous aneurysm. The patient had a remarkable recovery. CONCLUSION In rare cases, ethmoidal AVFs can present with an unusual venous drainage. Clinical presentation may be similar to carotid cavernous fistulae, and proper identification of the lesion using an angiogram is essential to guide treatment. In cases in which other approaches fail to treat the fistula, direct surgical exposure of the SOV followed by embolization using coiling and Onyx may be successful in achieving AVF occlusion.", "UNLABELLED / PURPOSE: Perforated peptic ulcer (PPU) is still an existing disease that occurs frequently in the 21st century despite of the wide availability of antiulcer medication and Helicobacter eradication. The current study aimed to evaluate the hypothesis that its outcome might be improved by using the laparoscopy. The outcome of treatment in terms of complications, mortality and hospital stay with relevant to laparoscopy was analyzed. PATIENTS AND METHODS This prospective descriptive study was carried on the period of 3 years from July 2009 till July 2012. All patients with acute abdominal pain that was clinically diagnosed as having perforated peptic ulcer were included. Excluded from this study were those patients with concomitant bleeding from the ulcer and evidence of gastric outlet obstructions. Also excluded were those with evidence of large perforation more than 10 mm and patients with symptoms of more than 36 h durations for fear of septic shock. RESULTS Forty seven patients were studied out of a total 53 PPU patients; they were 41 males and 6 females with the male to female ratio of 6.8:1. Their age ranged from 19 to 55 years with the mean age of 39.5 \u00b1 8.6 years. Forty five patients were successfully treated by laparoscopy while only 2 cases that were early presented with signs of hypovolumic shock were converted into laparotomy due to severe bleeding. The mean hospital stay was 75 \u00b1 12.6 h. Post operative complications included death of one patient in the postoperative period at the Intensive care unit (ICU) plus post operative fever in the 2 patients who underwent laparotomy and it was amenable to treatment. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic repair of a perforated peptic ulcer is an amenable and feasible technique within the hands of experienced laparoscopic surgeon when the cases are early and properly diagnosed.", "Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) is a rare hereditary syndrome due to mutations of the proto-oncogene REarranged during Transfection (RET), defined by the association of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) in almost 100% cases, and pheochromocytoma in roughly 50% (primary hyperparathyroidism can be seen in 10-20% of patients with MEN2A). Early thyroidectomy and the efficacy of novel tyrosine kinase inhibitors modified the natural history of MTC, with possibilities of cure or long-term control. The second main compound, pheochromocytoma, is reported with a variable penetrance, from 10 to 80% cases, depending on the mutation of RET. Pheochromocytoma constitutes the main disease to screen in patients with RET mutations. Pheochromocytoma clinical and biochemical diagnosis, as well as the way to treat it are thus crucial. This review will thus focus on the epidemiological specificities of MEN2-related pheochromocytoma, the genotype/phenotype relationship, the modern imaging modalities necessary to confirm the diagnosis in this hereditary context, as well as the optimal management and the possibilities of adrenal sparing surgery. Additional information will include the natural history of MEN2B-pheochromocytoma, the rare cases of malignant pheochromocytoma, and the factors that could modify the penetrance between individuals carrying the same mutation, especially in the same family.", " The aim of this study was to compare laparoscopic hepaticojejunostomy (LHJ) and open hepaticojejunostomy (OHJ) for choledochal cyst associated with hilar hepatic duct stenosis (HHDS). METHODS Data collection was prospective for LHJ cases from 2009 and retrospective for OHJ cases from 2003 to 2008. Data were compared with respect to HHDS. HHDS was incised longitudinally as required during hilar hepatic ductoplasty. RESULTS Fifty-eight subjects were studied (LHJ: n = 27, 4 boys, 23 girls; OHJ: n = 31; 6 boys, 25 girls). HHDS was present in 10 LHJ cases and 10 OHJ cases. Todani classification of choledochal cyst in LHJ patients was type 1A (n = 16) and type 4A (n = 11), and in OHJ patients, it was type 1A (n = 19) and type 4A (n = 12). There were significant differences between LHJ and OHJ with regard to mean operative time (386 vs 341 min), mean blood loss (5.9 vs 18.4 mL), recommencement of enteral feeding (3.9 vs 6.4 days), and hospital stay (11.7 vs 15.5 days) (all P < 0.05). Hepatic ductoplasty was performed in 23 LHJ patients and in 21 OHJ patients. There were no intraoperative complications and no conversions to OHJ. There were no significant differences between LHJ and OHJ, regardless of the presence of HHDS, for postoperative complications, which included minor bile leakage, anastomotic stricture, and intestinal obstruction. CONCLUSION LHJ is as effective as OHJ for the treatment of choledochal cysts irrespective of the presence of HHDS and the need for hepatic ductoplasty.", "Background and study aims Zenker's diverticulum may cause disabling symptoms, especially in the elderly. Treatment has changed in recent decades from open surgery to management with flexible endoscopy, resulting in lower morbidity and mortality. The goal of this study was to present the largest series, with the longest follow-up, of patients with Zenker's diverticulum receiving outpatient treatment with flexible endoscopy using a diverticuloscope and Ligasure (Covidien, Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States), a device that allows tissue sealing and coagulation of vessels before cutting the septum between the diverticulum and esophagus. Patients and methods We performed 79 diverticulotomies in 69 patients (65.2 % male, mean age 73.4 years). The mean diverticulum size was 2.8 cm. In three cases with a diverticulum \u2264 1.5 cm, the diverticuloscope could not be placed. Results The technical success was 95.83 % and the clinical success 96.7 %: 84 % of the 56 patients followed for a mean of 34.6 months (24 - 64 months) had no dysphagia. The recurrence rate was 10.4 %, with a good response to a second diverticulotomy at 12 months (IQR: 11.5 - 17) in most cases. The most severe complications were two microperforations, resolved with conservative treatment, and one case of delayed bleeding endoscopically-controlled with a clip. Conclusions Diverticulotomy of the esophageal-diverticular septum with Ligasure is an outpatient endoscopic technique that is simple, effective in the long term and very safe for the treatment of patients with Zenker's diverticulum. In symptomatic recurrences, a second procedure was equally safe and effective in most patients.", "OBJECTIVE To assess the cumulative effect of an enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) pathway and minimally invasive robot-assisted radical cystectomy with intracorporeal urinary diversion (iRARC) in comparison with open radical cystectomy (ORC) on length of hospital stay (LOS) and peri-operative outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between February 2009 and October 2017, 304 radical cystectomy cases were performed at a single institution (ORC, n = 54; robot-assisted radical cystectomy [RARC], n = 250). Data were prospectively collected. We identified 45 consecutive ORC cases performed without ERAS before the commencement of the RARC programme (Cohort A), 50 consecutive iRARC cases performed without ERAS (Cohort B) and 40 iRARC cases with ERAS (Cohort C). The primary outcome measure was LOS, while secondary outcome measures included peri-operative 90-day complications and readmission rate. Complications were accessed using the Clavien-Dindo system. RESULTS Patients in all cohorts were evenly matched with regard to age, sex, body mass index, neoadjuvant treatment, tumour stage, lymph node yield, previous pelvic radiotherapy and surgery, peri-operative anaemia, as well as physiological state. Patients who underwent iRARC with ERAS had a significantly higher American Society of Anesthesiologists score (III-IV) and were more likely to receive neobladder reconstruction. The median (interquartile range) LOS was shorter in the iRARC with ERAS group (7 [6-10]) days than in the iRARC without ERAS group (11 [8-15]) days and the ORC group (17 [14-21] days). In a propensity score-matched cohort of patients who underwent iRARC, patients who followed the ERAS pathway had significantly lower 90-day readmission rates. Additionally, implementing ERAS in an iRARC cohort resulted in a significantly lower 90-day all (P < 0.001) and gastrointestinal-related complications (P = 0.001). The ERAS pathway and younger patients were independently associated with an LOS of \u226410 days on multinomial logistic regression. CONCLUSION A comprehensive ERAS programme can significantly reduce LOS in patients undergoing iRARC without increasing 90-day readmission rates. An ERAS programme can augment the benefits of iRARC in improving peri-operative outcomes. In studies comparing ORC and RARC, the presence or absence of an ERAS programme will be a confounding factor and only level 1 evidence can be interpreted reliably.", " Placement of a heat moisture exchanger (HME) between aerosol generator and patient has been associated with greatly reduced drug delivery. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of filtered and nonfiltered HMEs placed between nebulizer and patient on aerosol deposition and airway resistance (Raw) in simulated ventilator-dependent adults. METHODS An in vitro lung model was developed to simulate a mechanically ventilated adult (Vt 500 mL, RR 15/min, and PEEP 5 cmH2O, using two inspiratory flow rates 40 and 50 L/min) using an intubated adult manikin with an endotracheal tube (8 mmID). The bronchi of the manikin were connected to a Y-adapter through a collecting filter (Respirgard II) attached to a test lung through a heated humidifier (37\u00b0C producing 100% relative humidity) to simulate exhaled humidity. For treatment conditions, a nonfiltered HME (ThermoFlo\u2122 6070; ARC Medical) and filtered HMEs (ThermoFlo\u2122 Filter; ARC Medical and PALL Ultipor; Pall Medical) were placed between the ventilator circuit at the endotracheal tube and allowed to acclimate to the exhaled heat and humidity for 30 minutes before aerosol administration. Airway resistance (cmH2O/L/s) was taken at 0, 10, 20, and 30 minutes after HME placement and after each of four aerosol treatments. Albuterol sulfate (2.5 mg/3 mL) was administered with jet (Misty Max 10; Airlife) and mesh (Aerogen Solo; Aerogen) nebulizers positioned in the inspiratory limb proximal to the Y-adapter. Control consisted of nebulization with no HME. Drug was eluted from filter at the end of the trachea and measured using spectrophotometry (276 nm). RESULTS Greater than 60% of the control dose was delivered through the ThermoFlo. No significant difference was found between the first four treatments given by the jet (p = 0.825) and the mesh (p = 0.753) nebulizers. There is a small increase in Raw between pre- and post-four treatments with the jet (p = 0.001) and mesh (p = 0.015) nebulizers. Aerosol delivery through filtered HMEs was similar (<0.5%) across the four treatments. Airway resistance was similar using the ThermoFlo Filter. With the PALL Ultipor, changes in Raw increased with mesh nebulizer after treatment (p = 0.005). Changes in resistance pre- and post-treatment were similar with both filtered HMEs. CONCLUSION The ThermoFlo\u2122 nonfilter HME allowed the majority of the control dose to be delivered to the airway. Increases in Raw would likely not be outside of a tolerable range in ventilated patients. In contrast, filtered HMEs should not be placed between nebulizers and patient airways. Further research with other HMEs and materials is warranted.", "PURPOSE Mechanical thrombectomy (mTE) proved to be effective treating acute vessel occlusions with an acceptable rate of procedural complications. Potential long-term side effects of the vessel wall trauma caused by mechanical irritation of the endothelium are unknown up to now. METHODS From a retrospectively established database of 640 acute stroke treatments, we selected 261 patients with 265 embolic vessel occlusions treated successfully by mTE without permanent implantation of a stent. Analysis comprised the type of devices used and the number of passes performed. Digital subtraction angiography immediately after treatment was evaluated for vasospasm, dissection, and extravasation. Control angiographic images were evaluated for any morphological change compared to the immediate posttreatment angiographic run. RESULTS Recanalization was achieved with a median of one (range 1-10) mTE maneuvers. Vasospasm occurred in 69 territories (26.0 %) and was treated with glyceroltrinitrate in three. Dissection was observed in one vessel (0.4 %). Intraprocedural hemorrhage in two patients (0.8 %) was either wire or device induced. Follow-up digital subtraction angiography was available for 117 territories after a median of 107 days, revealing target vessel occlusion in one segment (0.9 %) and a de novo stenosis of four segments (3.4 %). All findings were clinically asymptomatic. Posttreatment vasospasm was more frequent in patients with de novo stenosis and occlusion (p = 0.038). CONCLUSION De novo stenoses and occlusions occur in a small proportion of patients after mTE. Because all lesions were clinically asymptomatic, this finding does not affect the overall benefit of the treatment. Vasospasm may predict late vessel wall changes.", " Laparoscopic common bile duct exploration (LCBDE) is an effective, single-stage treatment for choledocholithiasis. However, LCBDE requires specific cognitive and technical skills, is infrequently performed by residents, and currently lacks suitable training and assessment modalities outside of the operating room. To address this gap in training, a simulator model for transcystic and transcholedochal LCBDE was developed and evaluated. METHODS A procedure algorithm incorporating essential cognitive and technical steps of LCBDE was developed, along with a physical model to allow performance of a simulated procedure. Modified Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) rating scales were developed to assess performance on the model. Construct validity was assessed by comparing the performance of novices (residents and surgeons without LCBDE experience) versus experienced subjects (surgeons with previous LCBDE experience). Concurrent validity was assessed by comparing scores from the LCBDE scales to those from the standard OSATS scale. Internal consistency and interrater reliability were assessed by comparing performance scores assigned by three independent raters. RESULTS Sixteen novices and five experienced subjects performed simulated procedures, with novices scoring lower than experienced subjects on both transcystic (20 \u00b1 3 vs. 33 \u00b1 2 [possible score range, 0-45], p < 0.001) and transcholedochal (25 \u00b1 8 vs. 42 \u00b1 3 [possible score range, 0-53], p < 0.001) rating scales. Scores on the rating scales correlated significantly with scores from the standard OSATS scale. Internal consistency and interrater reliability of the LCBDE rating scales were favorable. CONCLUSIONS The LCBDE simulator is a low-cost yet realistic physical model that allows performance and evaluation of technical skills required for LCBDE. The LCBDE rating scales show evidence of construct validity, concurrent validity, internal consistency, and interrater reliability. Use of the LCBDE model and associated rating scales allows procedure-specific feedback for trainees and could be used to improve current training.", "PURPOSE To evaluate technique effectiveness, safety, and interoperator performance of stereotactic radiofrequency ablation (SRFA) of liver lesions. METHODS Retrospective review including 90 consecutive patients from January 2008 to January 2010 with 106 computed tomography-guided SRFA sessions using both single and multiple electrodes for the treatment of 177 lesions: 72 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and 105 metastases with a mean size of 2.9 cm (range 0.5-11 cm). Technique effectiveness and 1-year local recurrence were evaluated by computed tomographic scans. Complications, mortality, and hospital days were recorded. The performance between an experienced and inexperienced interventional radiologist was compared. RESULTS The overall technique effectiveness after a single SRFA was 95.5% (93.1% for HCC and 97.1% for metastases). Four of the eight unsuccessfully treated lesions could be retreated (secondary technique effectiveness of 97.7%). Local recurrence at 1 year was 2.9%. Technique effectiveness was significantly different for lesions<5 cm (96.7%) and >5 cm (87.5%) (P=0.044) but not for lesions<3 cm (95.9%) and 3-5 cm (100%). Compared to clear parenchymal property (97.3%), vessel vicinity (93.3%) (P=0.349) and subcapsular (95.2%) (P=0.532) had no, but hollow viscera vicinity (83.3%) had a significantly lower technique effectiveness (P=0.020). Mortality rate was 0.9%. Major complications and hospital days were higher for cirrhosis Child-Pugh B (20%, 7.2 days) than Child-Pugh A (3.1%, 4.7 days) patients and for metastases (5.1%, 4.3 days). There was no significant difference in interoperator performance. CONCLUSION SRFA allowed for efficient, reliable, and safe ablation of large-volume liver disease.", "Ebola, physicians in training, and the duty to treat.", ": Chronic Hepatitis B (CHB) remains a major problem for global public health. Viral persistence and immune defects are the two major reasons for CHB, and it was hypothesized that based on a transient clearance of serum viral DNA and HBsAg \u201cwindow stage\u201d, active immunization against hepatitis B virus (HBV) might initiate effective host immune responses versus HBV to achieve functional cure of CHB. METHODS: Two experimental mouse models that mice hydrodynamic injected HBV DNA or infected with recombinant AAV/HBV were used. The \u201csandwich\u201d therapeutic effect by using a potent human anti-HBsAg neutralizing monoclonal antibody (G12) in combination with antiviral drug tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), followed by active immunization with HBsAg-HBsAb (mYIC) was evaluated. FINDINGS: A single G12 injection rapidly cleared serum HBsAg in HDI-HBV carrier mice, with a synergistic effect in decreasing viral DNA load when TDF was given orally. When both serum viral DNA and HBsAg load became low or undetectable, mYIC was administered. A more effective clearance of viral DNA and HBsAg was observed and serum HBsAb was developed only in these \u201csandwich\u201d-treated mice. Efficient intrahepatic anti-HBV immune responses were also observed in these mice, including the formation of aggregates of myeloid cells with CD8(+)T cells and increased TNF-\u03b1, granzyme B production. INTERPRETATION: The \u201csandwich\u201d combination therapy not only efficiently decreased HBsAg and HBV DNA levels but also induced effective cellular and humoral immunity, which may result in functional cure of CHB.", "Surgery remains the curative treatment modality for colorectal cancer in all stages, including stage IV with resectable liver metastasis. There is emerging evidence that the stress response caused by surgery as well as other perioperative therapies such as anesthesia and analgesia may promote growth of pre-existing micro-metastasis or potentially initiate tumor dissemination. Therapeutically targeting the perioperative period may therefore reduce the effect that surgical treatments have in promoting metastases, for example by combining \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonists and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors in the perioperative setting. In this paper, we highlight some of the mechanisms that may underlie surgery-related metastatic development in colorectal cancer. These include direct tumor spillage at the time of surgery, suppression of the anti-tumor immune response, direct stimulatory effects on tumor cells, and activation of the coagulation system. We summarize in more detail results that support a role for catecholamines as major drivers of the pro-metastatic effect induced by the surgical stress response, predominantly through activation of \u03b2-adrenergic signaling. Additionally, we argue that an improved understanding of surgical stress-induced dissemination, and more specifically whether it impacts on the level and nature of heterogeneity within residual tumor cells, would contribute to the successful clinical targeting of this process. Finally, we provide a proof-of-concept demonstration that ex-vivo analyses of colorectal cancer patient-derived samples using RGB-labeling technology can provide important insights into the heterogeneous sensitivity of tumor cells to stress signals. This suggests that intra-tumor heterogeneity is likely to influence the efficacy of perioperative \u03b2-adrenergic receptor and COX-2 inhibition, and that ex-vivo characterization of heterogeneous stress response in tumor samples can synergize with other models to optimize perioperative treatments and further improve outcome in colorectal and other solid cancers.", "PURPOSE Recurrent disease following thermal ablation therapy is a frequently reported problem. Preoperative identification of patients with high risk of recurrent disease might enable individualized treatment based on patients' risk profile. The aim of the present work was to investigate the role of metabolic parameters derived from the pre-ablation 18F-FDG PET/CT as imaging biomarkers for recurrent disease in patients with colorectal liver metastases (CLM). METHODS Included in this retrospective study were all consecutive patients with CLM treated with percutaneous or open thermal ablation therapy who had a pre-treatment baseline 18F-FDG PET/CT available. Multivariable cox regression for survival analysis was performed using different models for the metabolic parameters (SULpeak, SULmean, SULmax, partial volume corrected SULmean (cSULmean), and total lesion glycolysis (TLG)) corrected for tumour and procedure characteristics. The study endpoints were defined as local tumour progression free survival (LTP-FS), new intrahepatic recurrence free survival (NHR-FS) and extrahepatic recurrence free survival (EHR-FS). Clinical and imaging follow-up data was used as the reference standard. RESULTS Fifty-four patients with 90 lesions were selected. Univariable cox regression analysis resulted in eight models. Multivariable analysis revealed that after adjusting for lesion size and the approach of the procedure, none of the metabolic parameters were associated with LTP-FS or EHR-FS. Percutaneous approach was significantly associated with a shorter LTP-FS. It was demonstrated that lower values of SULpeak, SULmax, SULmean , and cSULmean are associated with a significant better NHR-FS, independent of the lesion size and number and prior chemotherapy. CONCLUSION We found no association between the metabolic parameters on pre-ablation 18F-FDG PET/CT and the LTP-FS. However, low values of the metabolic parameters were significantly associated with improved NHR-FS. The clinical implication of these findings might be the identification of high-risk patients who might benefit most from adjuvant or combined treatment strategies.", "PURPOSE OF REVIEW Patients suffering from acute lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) are at risk for developing chronic limb pain, heaviness, and fatigue, known as the post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). RECENT FINDINGS Although several studies have shown that catheter-directed therapy reduces clot burden and may improve clinical outcomes, the multicenter randomized controlled ATTRACT trial showed no difference in PTS or quality of life at 2 years between patients treated with pharmacomechanical catheter-directed thrombolysis (PCDT) and those treated with anticoagulation alone, and a higher major bleeding rate in the PCDT group. PCDT is not indicated for most patients diagnosed with lower extremity DVT. Since PCDT may benefit patients with iliofemoral DVT, intervention can be considered in this subset of patients if they are at low risk of bleeding.", " AND AIMS Total laparoscopic surgery is not a new concept, but it is not preferred generally for right colectomy. The aim of the study is to evaluate the outcomes, which are related with surgical technique after total laparoscopic right colectomy (TLRC) and laparoscopic-assisted right colectomy (LARC) for right colon cancer in 30 consecutive patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS Thirty patients with right colon cancer, half of which were treated with TLRC and half of which were treated with LARC, were compared with regard to patient demographics, operative and postoperative data, histopathologic findings, follow-up data, and the complications related to the surgical technique. RESULTS There were 16 men and 14 women, median age was 63 years (range 41-86) with a body mass index (BMI) of 27 kg/m2 (range 20-33). There were no differences between the groups for BMI, harvested lymph node number, or distal and radial margins. The length of the incision and the length of the postoperative stay was shorter in the TLRC group (p=0.000). Overall complications were higher in the LARC group than in the TLRC group (p=0.014). The median follow-up was 28 months (range 5-99). In the late period, two patients in the LARC group were reoperated on. The cause of reoperation was internal herniation in one patient due to ileal twisting and incisional hernia in the other one. CONCLUSION Our preliminary data indicate that TLRC could result in better outcomes for right colon cancer patients than LARC.", "Numerous acute ischemic stroke trials have recently published detailed results, providing an opportunity to consider the role of collaterals in stroke pathophysiology and their influential effect on patient outcomes. Safety and Efficacy of NeuroFlo Technology in Ischemic Stroke (SENTIS), the largest randomized controlled trial of device therapy to date, tested the potential augmentation of collateral perfusion. SYNTHESIS Expansion, Mechanical Retrieval and Recanalization of Stroke Clots Using Embolectomy (MR RESCUE), and Interventional Management of Stroke (IMS) III chronicled the saga of endovascular therapy trialed against medical treatment for acute ischemic stroke. These recent randomized studies, however, largely neglect current device technology available for endovascular therapy as advanced by the TREVO2 and SOLITAIRE\u2122(TM) FR With the Intention For Thrombectomy (SWIFT) studies. Such exhaustive efforts in recent trials have failed to introduce a new treatment for stroke that unequivocally improves patient outcomes. Collateral perfusion is widely recognized to vary across individuals in any population and exerts a dramatic effect on baseline variables including the time course of ischemic injury, stroke severity, imaging findings, and therapeutic opportunities. Similarly, collaterals have been recognized to influence recanalization, reperfusion, hemorrhagic transformation, and subsequent neurological outcomes after stroke. Collateral lessons may be gleaned from these trials, to expand consideration of overall study results and perhaps most importantly, alter ongoing and new trials in development. Detailed analyses of available information on collaterals from these trials demonstrate that collaterals may be more influential than the choice of treatment modality or intervention.", "Introduction Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is the primary treatment method for benign gallbladder diseases. Single incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) was reported to be superior in terms of work return, cosmetic results, and post-operative pain, but limited maneuver capacity and overlapping of hand tools are technical difficulties associated with SILC that endanger patient safety. Aim To perform SILC using a needle grasper for gallbladder traction, thus simplifying the dissection of Calot's triangle. Material and methods The files of patients who underwent elective LC for gallbladder stone and polyps in general surgery clinics between December 2013 and December 2014 were analyzed retrospectively. The patients were divided into two groups: needle-grasper-assisted SILC (nSILC) and conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy (CLC). Age, gender, height, weight, body mass index, visual analog scale (VAS) scores, ASA score, duration of operation, duration of post-operative hospital stay, complications, drain use, conversion to open and conventional technique, and oral feeding beginning time were analyzed. Results There were no per-operative or post-operative complications in either of the groups, and no significant differences were found between the groups in terms of complications. The mean duration of the operation was significantly longer in the nSILC group. There was no difference between the groups in terms of hospital stay. The mean visual analogue scale (VAS) scores in conventional nSILC were significantly lower for all hours. The patient satisfaction in terms of cosmetic results was better in the nSILC group. Conclusions Needle-grasper-assisted SILC reduces the number of tools that need to be held by surgeons; it also provides safe dissection, better cosmetic results, and less post-operative pain in elective cases.", "Platinum-based chemotherapy is the standard treatment for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but the evidence of its efficacy among ECOG performance status (PS)2 patients is weak because these patients are usually excluded from clinical trials; concern exists about tolerability and feasibility of standard chemotherapy in these patients. No prospective randomized trial has tested the addition of cisplatin to single-agent chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC and PS2. CAPPA-2 was a multicenter, randomized phase 3 study for first-line treatment of PS2 patients with advanced NSCLC. Patients, aged 18-70, were eligible if they had stage IV or IIIB with malignant pleural effusion or metastatic supraclavicular nodes (TNM VI edition) and adequate organ function. Patients in standard arm received gemcitabine 1200 mg/m(2) days 1 and 8. Patients in experimental arm received cisplatin 60 mg/m(2) day 1 plus gemcitabine 1000 mg/m(2) days 1 and 8. All treatments were repeated every 3 weeks, up to 4 cycles, unless disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). To have 80% power of detecting hazard ratio (HR) 0.71, corresponding to an increase in median OS from 4.8 to 6.8 months, 285 deaths were required. The study was stopped in June 2012 after the enrolment of 57 patients, due to the slow accrual and the report of positive results from a similar study. Median OS was 3.0 months with single-agent gemcitabine and 5.9 months with cisplatin plus gemcitabine (HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.28-0.98, p = 0.039). Combination chemotherapy produced longer PFS (median 1.7 vs. 3.3 months, HR 0.49, 95% CI 0.27-0.89, p = 0.017) and higher response rate (4% vs. 18%, p = 0.19), without substantial increase in toxicity. The addition of cisplatin to single-agent gemcitabine improves survival as first-line treatment of PS2 patients with advanced NSCLC.", " Dissecting aneurysms located along the distal segments of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) are extremely rare, accounting for only 0.5-0.7% of all intracranial aneurysms. Treatment of these aneurysms is challenging, both surgically and endovascularly. We present our preliminary experience and clinical data utilizing Onyx as an embolization agent in the treatment of these lesions with proximal parent artery preservation. METHODS 7 consecutive ruptured peripheral PICA aneurysms, in 7 patients, were treated with superselective Onyx embolization at our institutions. According to the anatomical classification of Lister et al, these aneurysms were located in the lateral medullary segment (n=1), tonsillomedullary segment (n=1), and the telovelotonsillary segment (n=5) of the PICA. Technical feasibility, procedure related complications, angiographic results, follow-up diagnostic imaging, and clinical outcome were evaluated. RESULTS In all cases, endovascular treatment was successful, with complete occlusion of the aneurysm with proximal parent artery preservation at the final postprocedural angiogram. Procedure related complications were not observed. One patient with a poor clinical condition at admission died during the initial hospital stay due to extensive subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage. No rebleeding or recanalization was noted during follow-up. Two patients had a residual moderate to severe disability at follow-up. Favorable outcomes, with no or mild disability, were observed in four of the surviving patients. CONCLUSIONS Angiographic, diagnostic imaging, and clinical results of our small series indicate that Onyx embolization of dissecting distal PICA aneurysms with parent artery preservation is an effective option with acceptable morbidity and mortality rate, in those cases in which surgical clipping or endovascular coiling of the aneurysmal sac is not suitable.", " Anastomotic leakages are severe complications of upper gastrointestinal surgery with serious morbidity and mortality. Until recently, only abscess drainage was possible. Since 2007, removable and repositionable covered metal self-expandable stents (RReCoMSeS) have been used in our hospital to cover leaks. METHODS Patients with postsurgical gastrointestinal leaks treated with RReCoMSeS between January 2007 and March 2010 were retrospectively evaluated and described. RESULTS Twenty-six patients were treated with RReCoMSeS (totally covered Choo/Hanaro and partially covered Endoflex stents). Included patients had anastomotic leaks after esophagectomy (15) and bariatric surgery (11). Overall successful sealing of the leak occurred in 81 % (including multiple procedures). In total 33 RReCoMSeS were used (mean 1.3 stents and 1.7 procedures per patient). Twenty-one of 33 RReCoMSeS succeeded in sealing the leak (64 %). Migration occurred in 24 % RReCoMSeS, and 9 % disintegrated. One stent (3 %) caused a perforation. CONCLUSIONS RReCoMSeS are a safe alternative for treating postsurgical leaks in the upper gastrointestinal tract. In 81 % of patients and with 64 % of the inserted stents, leaks were sealed successfully, with few complications. Fewer stents per patient were needed thanks to their repositionability. Stent migration is a major problem.", "PURPOSE To assess the feasibility of fusion imaging between intraprocedural ultrasound (US) and contrast-enhanced cone-beam CT (CBCT) for small (< 2 cm) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). MATERIALS AND METHODS Six patients (five males, one female, age range 58-80, mean 69 years), with small (mean diameter 16.8 mm) HCC poorly visible at US underwent percutaneous microwave ablation under US/CBCT fusion guidance. During general anesthesia with apnea control, a contrast- enhanced CBCT was acquired with an active tracker. Subsequently, real time US images were fused with CBCT images, and treatment performed under fusion imaging guidance. Feasibility of fusion imaging and percutaneous ablation were assessed, correct targeting (distance from center of tumor and center of ablation area <5 mm) and one-month primary technical efficacy were evaluated. Major and minor complications as well as overall procedural time were recorded. RESULTS US/CBCT fusion was feasible in all cases, allowing for completion of the treatment as previously planned (technical success 100%). Correct targeting was achieved in 4/6 cases (66%), while in two cases, center of tumor and center of ablated area were respectively 7 and 8 mm distant. At 1 month CT scan, all tumors were completely ablated (primary technical efficacy 100%). No major or minor complications occurred. Mean overall procedure time was 127 min. CONCLUSIONS US/CBCT fusion is a feasible technique for liver ablation, and might represent a useful tool to increase the correct targeting of poorly US-visible HCC nodules in the angio suite.", "Osteoid osteoma is a benign bone tumour; its main symptom is pain, which is sometimes resistant to analgesic or anti-inflammatory medication. The surgical treatment consists of en bloc excision or curettage of the lesion. Several alternative methods have been proposed, among which CT guided-percutaneous radiofrequency ablation. We report on ten patients who were diagnosed clinically and radiologically as presenting an osteoid osteoma and were treated with this technique, with more than two years follow-up. Results were uniformly excellent. The pain was relieved and the rate of post-operative complications was very low. We recommend percutaneous CT-guided radiofrequency ablation for the treatment of this lesion.", " A delta-shaped anastomosis in totally laparoscopic Billroth I gastrectomy could be performed easily and sufficiently using only laparoscopic linear staplers. However, the restricted maneuverability and severe blurring of these staplers along with their limited hemostability induced strain. In this study, we determined the feasibility and safety of performing delta-shaped anastomosis using the Endo GIA\u2122 Reloads with Tri-Staple\u2122 Technology combined with Endo GIA\u2122 Ultra Universal stapler (Tri-Staple) with a particular focus on short-term surgical outcomes. METHODS We performed a single-institutional prospective interventional study (UMIN 000008014). The Tri-Staple was prospectively used on 23 consecutive patients who underwent a curative totally laparoscopic Billroth I gastrectomy with delta-shaped anastomosis. These patients were matched with the 19 patients previously treated using the ENDOPATH(\u00ae) ETS Articulating Linear Cutters (ETS) on clinical and demographic characteristics. RESULTS There were no differences between the groups in anastomosis-related local complications, morbidity, non-anastomosis-related local complications, total systemic complications, and short-term outcomes with the exception of significantly reduced blood loss in the Tri-Staple group (ETS vs. Tri-Staple: 37 [10-306] vs. 15 [5-210] mL, p = 0.02). Intraoperative bleeding from the staple line was significantly reduced in the Tri-Staple group. The postoperative drain indwelling period (ETS vs. Tri-Staple, 6 [4-10] vs. 4 [2-43] days, p = 0.032), fasting period (5 [3-7] vs. 3 [3-24] days, p = 0.022), and hospital stay (14 [10-47] vs. 11 [6-58] days, p = 0.025) were significantly shorter in the Tri-Staple group. There was no mortality in this series. Acceleration assessed as indices of blurring of stapler tip might have a significant adverse influence on staple-line bleeding at stapling sites. CONCLUSION Totally laparoscopic Billroth I distal gastrectomy using Tri-Staple was feasible and safe with favorable short-term surgical outcomes. Reduced blurring while stapling may be a novel endpoint which newly developed stapling devices should target.", "OBJECT Flow-diversion treatment has been shown to be associated with high rates of angiographic obliteration; however, the treatment is relatively contraindicated in the acute phase following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) as these patients require periprocedural dual antiplatelet therapy. Acute coiling followed by flow diversion has emerged as an intriguing and feasible treatment option for ruptured complex and giant aneurysms. In this study the authors report outcomes and complications of patients with ruptured aneurysms undergoing coiling in the acute phase followed by planned delayed flow diversion. METHODS This case series includes patients from 2 institutions. All patients underwent standard endovascular coiling in the acute phase after SAH with the intention and plan to proceed with flow diversion at a later date. Outcomes studied included angiographic occlusion, procedure-related complications, and long-term clinical outcome as measured using the modified Rankin Scale. RESULTS A total of 31 patients underwent coiling in the acute phase with the intention to undergo flow diversion at a later date. The mean aneurysm size was 15.8 \u00b1 7.9 mm. Of the 31 patients undergoing coiling, 4 patients could not undergo further flow-diverter therapy: 3 patients (9.7%) died of complications of subarachnoid hemorrhage and 1 patient had permanent morbidity as a result of perioperative ischemic stroke (3.1%). Twenty-seven patients underwent staged placement of flow diverters after adequate recovery. The median time to treatment was 16 weeks. There was one case of aneurysm rebleeding following coil treatment. There were no cases of permanent morbidity or mortality resulting from flow-diverter treatment. Twenty-four patients underwent imaging follow-up; 18 of these patients had aneurysms that were completely or nearly completely occluded (58.1% on an intent-to-treat basis). At last follow-up (mean 18.3 months), 25 patients had mRS scores \u2264 2 (80.6% on an intent-to-treat basis). CONCLUSIONS Staged treatment of ruptured complex and giant intracranial aneurysms with coiling in the acute phase and flow-diverter treatment following recovery from SAH is both safe and effective. In this series, no cases of rebleeding occurred during the interval between coiling and flow diversion. This strategy should be considered as a valid option in patients presenting with these challenging ruptured aneurysms.", " There is an increasing, though still limited, amount of evidence describing the use of the transanal hemorrhoidal dearterialization (THD) device for the treatment of hemorrhoidal disease. This study assesses postoperative outcomes from a single surgeon experience with the THD device. METHODS From January 2009 to December 2011, 108 THD procedures were performed. With Doppler guidance, the THD device makes possible precise ligation of the branches of the superior hemorrhoidal artery. Patients were seen postoperatively at 3 weeks and 6 months. They underwent physical examination to determine whether there was recurrence of hemorrhoidal prolapse. They were asked to describe any bleeding, to rate pain using the visual analog scale, and to rate their level of satisfaction on a scale of 1-5 (with 5 = highly satisfied). A phone interview was used for follow-up at 1 year to determine the rate of recurrent prolapse. RESULTS Of the 108 patients who underwent THD, two were lost to follow-up and excluded. All of the remaining 106 patients completed follow-up at 3 weeks and 6 months. At 3 weeks, 92% of patients had no pain and 88% were highly satisfied with the procedure at 3 weeks. This increased to 92% satisfaction at 1 year. Prolapse recurrence was 7.5% at 6 months and 10.3% at 1 year. Bleeding was the most common complication, but did not require re-intervention or transfusion. CONCLUSIONS THD is a same-day procedure for the treatment of hemorrhoidal disease that is safe and effective, and offers the potential for immediate return to normal activity.", "Fracture blisters are tense vesicles that arise on markedly swollen skin overlying traumatized soft tissue. While this relatively uncommon complication has been well described in the trauma literature, this article reports for the first time a case of fracture blisters after primary total knee arthroplasty. The fracture blisters developed within 36 hours of surgery and were associated with profound swelling and erythema. There was no evidence of vascular injury, compartment syndrome, iatrogenic fracture, or deep venous thrombosis. The patient was treated with leg elevation, loosely applied nonadhesive dressings, and a short course of oral antibiotics after skin desquamation. Blood-filled blisters required longer time to reepithelialization than fluid-filled blisters. Knee stiffness developed because of pain and fear of participation with physical therapy, but the patient was able to resume intensive rehabilitation after resolution of the blisters. Patient factors, surgical factors, and review of the literature are discussed.", "OBJECTIVE Spacer gel is used to reduce the rectal dose in prostate radiotherapy. It is injected to increase the distance between the prostate and rectum. During the course of external radiotherapy treatment, physiological changes in rectal volume exist. When using polyethylene glycol material, such as DuraSeal(\u00ae) (Covidien, Mansfield, MA), gel resorption also occurs. Together, these factors alter the original dose plan distribution. METHODS External dose planning and calculations were simulated using images acquired from 10 patients who were treated with brachytherapy and gel. The CT series was taken relative to gel injection: pre 1 day, post 1 day, post 1 month and post 2 months. Adaptive planning was compared with a single plan. RESULTS Adaptive planning shows better results compared with the single plan used in the total treatment course; however, the effect is minor. CONCLUSION Gel usage is clearly favourable to rectal DVH. Using adaptive planning with gel improves rectal DVH but is not necessary according to this study. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE Spacer gel is used in prostate radiotherapy to increase distance between the prostate and the rectum, thus reducing the rectal doses. During the treatment course, gel resorption exists which affects the rectal doses. The usefulness of adaptive planning to compensate this resorption effect has not been studied before.", "Surgery is the mainstay of treatment in early- and intermediate-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), yet recurrences are frequent. Studies have documented the benefits of chemotherapy administered after resection, but a number of questions remain regarding how overall outcomes can be further improved. To provide the oncology community with direction on these issues, a consensus conference of leading experts in the NSCLC field was held at the Fifth Annual Atlanta Lung Cancer Symposium on October 25-27, 2007. The available scientific literature is presented and when such literature is lacking, clinical experience is provided to support the following conclusions. Preoperative staging should be done in accordance with the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines, but endoscopic fine needle aspiration of enlarged mediastinal nodes can be used, and if histology is positive for malignancy, mediastinoscopy can be avoided. Neoadjuvant systemic therapy is not generally recommended but can be considered to downstage an unresectable patient. There is currently no role for preoperative radiation or chemoradiation. Adjuvant systemic therapy is not recommended for stage IA and IB patients; however, adverse prognostic factors are acceptable reasons to consider adjuvant systemic therapy in the latter. Adjuvant systemic therapy is recommended for stage IIA, IIB, and IIIA patients, consistent with recent American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines. A cisplatin-based regimen should be started within 60 days after surgery, but if relatively contraindicated, carboplatin is an acceptable alternative. Adjuvant radiation therapy is not recommended for N0 and N1 patients, but is used in N2 patients to decrease local recurrence.", " The potential clinical benefits of targeted therapy with coagulation factor concentrates (e.g., fibrinogen) and antifibrinolytic agents (e.g., tranexamic acid [TXA]) for the treatment of trauma-induced coagulopathy are increasingly recognized. We hypothesized that human fibrinogen concentrate (FC) and prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), administered as combined therapy with TXA, would provide additive effects for reducing blood loss in an animal trauma model. METHODS Thirty-six pigs were subjected to 2 consecutive blunt liver injuries, resulting in severe hemorrhagic shock and coagulopathy. Intervention comprised saline (control group); TXA (15 mg kg, TXA group); TXA and FC (90 mg kg, TXA-FC); or TXA, FC, and PCC (20 U kg, TXA-FC-PCC). Blood loss, thromboelastometry (ROTEM), measures of thrombin generation, platelet activation, and global coagulation variables were monitored for 4 hours. Tissue sections were examined to determine the occurrence of thromboembolic events. RESULTS Total blood loss was similar in the TXA-FC and TXA-FC-PCC groups (mean \u00b1 SD: 1012 \u00b1 86 mL and 1037 \u00b1 118 mL, respectively; P = 1.000). These values were both lower (P < 0.001) than the TXA group (1579 \u00b1 306 mL). Blood loss in all 3 intervention groups was lower (P < 0.001) than in the control group (2376 \u00b1 478 mL). After trauma and resuscitation, but before study intervention, plasma fibrinogen levels were severely depleted (median for the whole study population: 66 mg dL; interquartile range: 51-108 mg dL) and clot strength was decreased (EXTEM whole-blood maximum clot firmness [MCF]: 53 \u00b1 5 mm). Compared with controls, TXA inhibited fibrinolysis and stabilized MCF and clotting time. The addition of FC restored and stabilized hemostasis to a greater extent than TXA alone; the addition of PCC had no statistically significant impact on blood loss, clot strength (MCF), or clotting time, but it increased thrombin generation. There were no significant differences among the study groups regarding platelet activation. No thrombi or microthrombi were observed in any group at necropsy. CONCLUSIONS The early use of TXA and FC reduced blood loss and improved coagulation measurements in a porcine model of blunt liver injury and hemorrhagic shock. FC, administered in addition to TXA, was highly effective in reducing blood loss. The lack of statistically significant reduction in blood loss when PCC was added to TXA and FC may be attributable to the absence of thrombin generation impairment in this model.", "Mouse hepatitis virus 3 (MHV 3) is either avirulent (resistant mice), hepatotropic (susceptible mice). or neurotropic (semisusceptible mice), depending on the strain of mice infected. In semisusceptible mice, infection led first to a transient meningitis, ependymitis, and leukoencephalitis, followed by a permanent communicating hydrocephalus and, later on, to a chronic thrombotic vasculitis affecting meningeal and parenchymal vessels at the brain stem level. Small foci of ischemic necrosis related to vascular occlusions were seen in the dorsal brain stem. Cyclophosphamide treatment of semisusceptible mice significantly reduced the meningeal infiltrates but did not prevent the development of hydrocephalus and other neuropathologic changes. Identical lesions occurred in fully susceptible mice infected with a low dose of virus, but no neurologic disorder could be induced in genetically resistant mice even following immunosuppression or intracranial inoculation. The leukoencephalitis differed from the demyelinating lesions observed with MHV4. Vascular lesions were of particular interest. More attention should be given to the possibifity of virus induced chronic cerebral vasculitis in man.", " Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) are treatment options for aortic stenosis in patients with prior coronary artery bypass graft surgery. We assessed the major clinical outcomes of such patients enrolled in the CoreValve High Risk (CHR) study. METHODS Of the 795 CHR study patients, 226 had prior coronary artery bypass graft surgery; 115 underwent TAVR and 111 underwent SAVR. The primary endpoint was a comparison of all-cause mortality at 1 year. Important secondary clinical endpoints were assessed. RESULTS At 1 year, all-cause mortality was 9.6% for TAVR versus 18.1% for SAVR (p = 0.06); cardiovascular mortality was 7.0% for TAVR versus 13.8% for SAVR (p = 0.09). A combination of The Society of Thoracic Surgeons risk score greater than 7 and age greater than 80 years was a significant predictor of mortality, with TAVR demonstrating a survival advantage (p = 0.03). No differences were seen for stroke. The SAVR group had longer intensive care unit and hospital stays, increased incidence of acute kidney injury, life-threatening or disabling bleeding, and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (p < 0.05). Pacemaker implantation and paravalvular regurgitation were greater with TAVR at all timepoints. CONCLUSIONS For patients with prior coronary artery bypass graft surgery and aortic stenosis, TAVR offers a significant morbidity advantage and a strong trend toward improved survival over SAVR at 1 year.", "PURPOSE Recurrent disease following thermal ablation therapy is a frequently reported problem. Preoperative identification of patients with high risk of recurrent disease might enable individualized treatment based on patients' risk profile. The aim of the present work was to investigate the role of metabolic parameters derived from the pre-ablation 18F-FDG PET/CT as imaging biomarkers for recurrent disease in patients with colorectal liver metastases (CLM). METHODS Included in this retrospective study were all consecutive patients with CLM treated with percutaneous or open thermal ablation therapy who had a pre-treatment baseline 18F-FDG PET/CT available. Multivariable cox regression for survival analysis was performed using different models for the metabolic parameters (SULpeak, SULmean, SULmax, partial volume corrected SULmean (cSULmean), and total lesion glycolysis (TLG)) corrected for tumour and procedure characteristics. The study endpoints were defined as local tumour progression free survival (LTP-FS), new intrahepatic recurrence free survival (NHR-FS) and extrahepatic recurrence free survival (EHR-FS). Clinical and imaging follow-up data was used as the reference standard. RESULTS Fifty-four patients with 90 lesions were selected. Univariable cox regression analysis resulted in eight models. Multivariable analysis revealed that after adjusting for lesion size and the approach of the procedure, none of the metabolic parameters were associated with LTP-FS or EHR-FS. Percutaneous approach was significantly associated with a shorter LTP-FS. It was demonstrated that lower values of SULpeak, SULmax, SULmean , and cSULmean are associated with a significant better NHR-FS, independent of the lesion size and number and prior chemotherapy. CONCLUSION We found no association between the metabolic parameters on pre-ablation 18F-FDG PET/CT and the LTP-FS. However, low values of the metabolic parameters were significantly associated with improved NHR-FS. The clinical implication of these findings might be the identification of high-risk patients who might benefit most from adjuvant or combined treatment strategies.", "PURPOSE To report our experience with intraoperative complications involving the internal carotid artery (ICA) during trans-sphenoidal surgery and their outcome with reconstructive endovascular management. METHODS A retrospective review was conducted of patients with an ICA injury related to trans-sphenoidal surgery from 2000 to 2012. Demographic data, clinical charts, indications for treatment, radiographic images, lesion characteristics, operative notes, endovascular procedure notes and post-procedure hospital course were reviewed. RESULTS Three men and one woman of mean age of 52 years (range 33-74) were identified. The lesions included two macroadenomas, one meningioma and one chondrosarcoma. Risk factors for ICA rupture included two patients with carotid dehiscence, one with sphenoid septal attachment to the ICA, two with revision surgery, one with prior radiation to the tumor, one with bromocriptine treatment and two with acromegaly. In three patients, covered stent placement achieved hemostasis at the site of injury within the ICA. One patient developed delayed bleeding 6 h after covered stent placement and underwent successful endovascular occlusion of the ICA but died 6 days after the injury. The fourth patient had an intraoperative ICA stroke requiring suction thrombectomy, thrombolysis, stent placement and evacuation of an epidural hematoma. At 1-year follow-up, two patients had a modified Rankin score (mRS) and National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 0; in the patient who had a stroke the mRS score was 1 and the NIHSS score 2. CONCLUSIONS Endovascular management with arterial reconstruction is helpful in the treatment of ICA injuries during trans-sphenoidal surgery.", " Embolisation has long been used as an adjunct to surgical resection in the treatment of brain arteriovenous malformation (bAVM). The most commonly used embolic material, n-butylcyanoacrylate glue, requires experience and skill to handle its quick and unpredictable flow and polymerisation. A new liquid embolic agent, ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer (Onyx), is less adhesive and polymerises slowly, which provides better control for radiologists performing embolisation. OBJECTIVE To report our experience in embolisation using Onyx alone or in combination with histoacryl for bAVM embolisation in our tertiary referral centre. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the anatomy, technical conditions, complications and clinical outcome of all bAVM patients embolised at our centre using Onyx alone or in combination with n-butylcyanoacrylate glue. RESULTS Between 2010 and 2013, 13 patients [6 (46.2%) male; 7 (53.8%) female; aged, 14-57 years] were included, and a total of 31 embolisations were performed. Clinical presentation included hemorrhage [9 (69.2%)], seizures [2 (15.4%)], and headache [2 (15.4%)]. Most AVMs were located in the brain hemispheres [12 (92.3%)] and measured <3 cm [7 (53.8%]. Complete occlusion of the AVM was obtained in 2 (15.4%) patients; 11 (84.6%) patients had partial occlusion [6 (54.5%) had <50% nidus occlusion]. Complications occurred in four procedures involving 3 patients (morbidity, 23.1%). This resulted in the death of 1 patient (mortality, 7.7%) and complete recovery with no disability in 2 patients. CONCLUSION The total nidal occlusion achieved herein is comparable to other similar studies. Our morbidity and mortality were higher compared to other studies which may be attributed to the small number of patients. More data is being collected which may better reflect on our experience.", "Human coronaviruses are known for their tropism for central nervous system and to be associated with neurological complications. SARS-CoV-2 pandemy represent a major health issue and if respiratory symptoms are at the forefront, neurological symptoms should be expected. Here we report the case of two patient that developed encephalitic symptoms with neuropsychological impairment and pathologic cerebrospinal fluid features concomitantly to SARS-CoV-2 documented infection. Both patient recovered promptly without treatment. This report raises the question of central nervous system involvement in SARS-CoV-2 infection and the need for investigation of neuropsychological complications in infected patient.", "OBJECTIVE We sought to identify the major risk factors associated with mortality in Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery.  Bariatric surgery has become an established treatment for extreme obesity. Bariatric surgery mortality has steadily declined with current rates of less than 0.5%. However, significant variation in the mortality rates has been reported for specific patient cohorts and among bariatric centers. METHODS Clinical outcome data from 185,315 bariatric surgery patients from the Bariatric Outcome Longitudinal Database were reviewed. Of these, 157,559 patients had either documented 30 or more day follow-up data, including mortality. Multiple demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical factors were analyzed by univariate analysis for their association with 30-day mortality after gastric bypass. Variables found to be significant were entered into a multiple logistic regression model to identify factors independently associated with 30-day mortality. On the basis of these results, a RYGB mortality risk score was developed. RESULTS The overall 30-day mortality rate for the entire bariatric surgery cohort was 0.1%. Of the 81,751 RYGB patients, the mortality rate was 0.15%. Factors significantly associated with 30-day gastric bypass mortality included increasing body mass index (BMI) (P<0.0001), increasing age (P<0.005), male gender (P<0.001), pulmonary hypertension (P<0.0001), congestive heart failure (P=0.0008), and liver disease (P=0.038). When the RYGB risk score was applied, a significant trend (P<0.0001) between increasing risk score and mortality rate is found. CONCLUSIONS Increasing BMI, increasing age, male gender, pulmonary hypertension, congestive heart failure, and liver disease are risk factors for 30-day mortality after RYGB. The RYGB risk score can be used to determine patients at greater risk for mortality after RYGB surgery.", "The fast-growing field of bioelectronic medicine aims to develop engineered systems that can relieve clinical conditions by stimulating the peripheral nervous system1-5. This type of technology relies largely on electrical stimulation to provide neuromodulation of organ function or pain. One example is sacral nerve stimulation to treat overactive bladder, urinary incontinence and interstitial cystitis (also known as bladder pain syndrome)4,6,7. Conventional, continuous stimulation protocols, however, can cause discomfort and pain, particularly when treating symptoms that can be intermittent (for example, sudden urinary urgency)8. Direct physical coupling of electrodes to the nerve can lead to injury and inflammation9-11. Furthermore, typical therapeutic stimulators target large nerve bundles that innervate multiple structures, resulting in a lack of organ specificity. Here we introduce a miniaturized bio-optoelectronic implant that avoids these limitations by using (1) an optical stimulation interface that exploits microscale inorganic light-emitting diodes to activate opsins; (2) a soft, high-precision biophysical sensor system that allows continuous measurements of organ function; and (3) a control module and data analytics approach that enables coordinated, closed-loop operation of the system to eliminate pathological behaviours as they occur in real-time. In the example reported here, a soft strain gauge yields real-time information on bladder function in a rat model. Data algorithms identify pathological behaviour, and automated, closed-loop optogenetic neuromodulation of bladder sensory afferents normalizes bladder function. This all-optical scheme for neuromodulation offers chronic stability and the potential to stimulate specific cell types.", "The literature about tibial tuberosity advancement surgery in dogs and humans informed the development of a version of the operation using a wedge-shaped implant of titanium foam. Computer-assisted drawing and stereolithography was used to create instruments and implants that were evaluated by cadaver surgery. A trial, involving 26 client-owned dogs with lameness due to cranial cruciate ligament failure, was started. Follow-up was done by clinical and radiographic examination after 4 wk and clinical examination again 6-11 mo after surgery. The titanium foam implant maintained tibial tuberosity advancement easily and effectively. The same major complication occurred in 2 of the first 6 cases before, a slightly modified technique was used to treat 20 dogs without complication. At mid-term follow-up (6-11 mo), 20/26 dogs (77%) had returned to full function, two dogs (7.7%) had acceptable function, two dogs (7.7%) could not be evaluated due to recent contra lateral modified Maquet procedure surgery, and two (7.7%) dogs had died for reasons unrelated to the study. This is the first clinical report of the use of titanium foam in veterinary orthopaedics. Modified Maquet procedure appears to be an effective treatment for lameness due to failure of the cranial cruciate ligament in dogs.", "Background. Spain has been one of the countries most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective. To create a registry of patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in Spain in order to improve our knowledge of the clinical, diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic aspects of this disease. Methods. A multicentre retrospective cohort study, including consecutive patients hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 throughout Spain. Epidemiological and clinical data, additional tests at admission and at seven days, treatments administered, and progress at 30 days of hospitalization were collected from electronic medical records. Results. Up to April 30th 2020, 6,424 patients from 109 hospitals were included. Their median age was 69.1 years (range: 18-102 years) and 56.9% were male. Prevalences of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus were 50.2%, 39.7%, and 18.7%, respectively. The most frequent symptoms were fever (86.2%) and cough (76.5%). High values of ferritin (72.4%), lactate dehydrogenase (70.2%), and D-dimer (61.5%), as well as lymphopenia (52.6%), were frequent. The most used antiviral drugs were hydroxychloroquine (85.7%) and lopinavir/ritonavir (62.4%). 31.5% developed respiratory distress. Overall mortality rate was 21.1%, with a marked increase with age (50-59 years: 4.2%, 60-69 years: 9.1%, 70-79 years: 21.4%, 80-89 years: 42.5%, [\u2265] 90 years: 51.1%). Conclusions. The SEMI-COVID-19 Network provides data on the clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in Spain. Patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in Spain are mostly severe cases, as one in three patients developed respiratory distress and one in five patients died. These findings confirm a close relationship between advanced age and mortality.", " Foot ulcers in people with diabetes are a prevalent and serious global health issue. Dressings form a key part of ulcer treatment, with clinicians and patients having many different types to choose from including hydrogel dressings. A clear and current overview of current evidence is required to facilitate decision-making regarding dressing use. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of hydrogel wound dressings compared with alternative dressings or none on the healing of foot ulcers in people with diabetes. SEARCH METHODS For this first update, in April 2013, we searched the following databases the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register; The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid EMBASE; and EBSCO CINAHL. There were no restrictions based on language or date of publication. SELECTION CRITERIA Published or unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that have compared the effects on ulcer healing of hydrogel with alternative wound dressings or no dressing in the treatment of foot ulcers in people with diabetes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. MAIN RESULTS We included five studies (446 participants) in this review. Meta analysis of three studies comparing hydrogel dressings with basic wound contract dressings found significantly greater healing with hydrogel: risk ratio (RR) 1.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.27 to 2.56. The three pooled studies had different follow-up times (12 weeks, 16 weeks and 20 weeks) and also evaluated ulcers of different severities (grade 3 and 4; grade 2 and grade unspecified). One study compared a hydrogel dressing with larval therapy and found no statistically significant difference in the number of ulcers healed and another found no statistically significant difference in healing between hydrogel and platelet-derived growth factor. There was also no statistically significant difference in number of healed ulcers between two different brands of hydrogel dressing. All included studies were small and at unclear risk of bias and there was some clinical heterogeneity with studies including different ulcer grades. No included studies compared hydrogel with other advanced wound dressings. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS There is some evidence to suggest that hydrogel dressings are more effective in healing (lower grade) diabetic foot ulcers than basic wound contact dressings however this finding is uncertain due to risk of bias in the original studies. There is currently no research evidence to suggest that hydrogel is more effective than larval therapy or platelet-derived growth factors in healing diabetic foot ulcers, nor that one brand of hydrogel is more effective than another in ulcer healing. No RCTs comparing hydrogel dressings with other advanced dressing types were found.", "The annular pancreas in adults is a rare congenital anomaly that is detected after development of complications, such as gastric outlet obstruction, recurrent pancreatitis, and peptic ulcer. Duodenal bypass is the procedure of choice for treating duodenal obstruction caused by the annular pancreas in both children and adults. Duodenoduodenostomy is routinely performed in neonates and children. In adults, duodenojejunostomy or gastrojejunostomy are recommended, because the duodenum is less mobile. We report a case of annular pancreas in a 33-year-old male that was successfully treated with laparoscopic gastrojejunostomy.", " Extensive deep venous thrombosis (DVT) during pregnancy is usually treated with anticoagulation alone, risking significant post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) in young patients. Catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) and operative venous thrombectomy have been safely and effectively used in nonpregnant patients, demonstrating significant reduction in post-thrombotic morbidity. This report reviews short- and long-term outcomes of 13 patients with extensive DVT of pregnancy treated with a strategy of thrombus removal. METHODS From 1999 to 2013, 13 patients with iliofemoral DVT during pregnancy were offered CDT, pharmacomechanical thrombolysis (PMT), and/or venous thrombectomy. Gestational age ranged from 8 to 34 weeks. Fetal monitoring was performed throughout hospitalization. Radiation exposure was minimized with pelvic lead shields, focal fluoroscopy, and limited angiographic runs. Follow-up included objective vein evaluation using venous duplex and PTS assessment using the Villalta scale. RESULTS CDT and/or PMT were used in 11 patients. Two patients underwent venous thrombectomy alone, and one patient had operative thrombectomy as an adjunct to CDT and PMT. Each patient had complete or near-complete thrombus resolution and rapid improvement in clinical symptoms. Eight of 11 having CDT or PMT underwent venoplasty and stenting of the involved iliac veins. Twelve of the 13 delivered healthy infants at term. One patient opted for termination of her pregnancy. Mean patient and gestational ages were 26 years and 26 weeks, respectively. Mean follow-up was 1.3 years, with only one recurrence. Duplex ultrasonography demonstrated patent veins in all but one patient and normal valve function in 10 patients. Eleven patients had Villalta scores <5 (considered normal), with a mean score of 0.7. CONCLUSIONS Extensive DVT of pregnancy can be effectively and safely treated with a strategy of thrombus removal, resulting in a patent venous system, normal valve function in many, prevention of PTS, and reduction in recurrence.", "Platinum-based chemotherapy is the standard treatment for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but the evidence of its efficacy among ECOG performance status (PS)2 patients is weak because these patients are usually excluded from clinical trials; concern exists about tolerability and feasibility of standard chemotherapy in these patients. No prospective randomized trial has tested the addition of cisplatin to single-agent chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC and PS2. CAPPA-2 was a multicenter, randomized phase 3 study for first-line treatment of PS2 patients with advanced NSCLC. Patients, aged 18-70, were eligible if they had stage IV or IIIB with malignant pleural effusion or metastatic supraclavicular nodes (TNM VI edition) and adequate organ function. Patients in standard arm received gemcitabine 1200 mg/m(2) days 1 and 8. Patients in experimental arm received cisplatin 60 mg/m(2) day 1 plus gemcitabine 1000 mg/m(2) days 1 and 8. All treatments were repeated every 3 weeks, up to 4 cycles, unless disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). To have 80% power of detecting hazard ratio (HR) 0.71, corresponding to an increase in median OS from 4.8 to 6.8 months, 285 deaths were required. The study was stopped in June 2012 after the enrolment of 57 patients, due to the slow accrual and the report of positive results from a similar study. Median OS was 3.0 months with single-agent gemcitabine and 5.9 months with cisplatin plus gemcitabine (HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.28-0.98, p = 0.039). Combination chemotherapy produced longer PFS (median 1.7 vs. 3.3 months, HR 0.49, 95% CI 0.27-0.89, p = 0.017) and higher response rate (4% vs. 18%, p = 0.19), without substantial increase in toxicity. The addition of cisplatin to single-agent gemcitabine improves survival as first-line treatment of PS2 patients with advanced NSCLC.", "OBJECTIVES Osteoarthritis is a chronic disease characterized by irreversible damage to joint structures, including loss of articular cartilage, osteophyte formation, alterations in the subchondral bone and synovial inflammation. It has been shown that chondroitin sulfate interferes with the progression of structural changes in joint tissues and is used in the management of patients with osteoarthritis. METHODS This review summarizes data from relevant reports describing the mechanisms of action of chondroitin sulfate that may explain the beneficial effects of the drug and examines the evidence for clinical efficacy of oral chondroitin sulfate in osteoarthritis. Data included in the review were derived from a literature search in PubMed. Literature searches were performed in PubMed using the search terms 'chondroitin sulfate', 'pharmaceutical-grade', 'osteoarthritis', 'randomized clinical trials', 'humans'. The MEDLINE database was searched from January 1996 through August 2012 for all randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and review articles of chondroitin sulfate in osteoarthritis. RESULTS Chondroitin sulfate exerts in vitro a beneficial effect on the metabolism of different cell lines: chondrocytes, synoviocytes and cells from subchondral bone, all involved in osteoarthritis. It increases type II collagen and proteoglycan synthesis in human articular chondrocytes and is able to reduce the production of some pro-inflammatory factors and proteases, to reduce the cellular death process, and improve the anabolic/catabolic balance of the extracellular cartilage matrix (ECM). Clinical trials have reported a beneficial effect of chondroitin sulfate on pain and function. The structure-modifying effects of chondroitin sulfate have been reported and analyzed in recent meta-analyses. The results in knee osteoarthritis demonstrate a small but significant reduction in the rate of decline in joint space width. Because chondroitin sulfate quality of several nutraceuticals has been found to be poor, it is recommended that pharmaceutical-grade chondroitin sulfate is used rather than food supplements in the treatment of OA. Chondroitin sulfate is recommended by several guidelines from international societies in the management of knee and hip OA. Furthermore, its safety profile is favorable when compared with many other therapies used in OA. CONCLUSION Chondroitin sulfate is an effective and safe treatment option for patients with osteoarthritis.", "AIMS This was a pilot study assessing the impact of a sensory adapted dental environment (SADE) on children with developmental disabilities (DD) receiving routine dental care. METHODS A crossover study of 22 children with DD, aged 6 through 21, was conducted at a University Pediatric Dental clinic. Each participant was randomized to a sequence of two dental cleanings on a 3- to 4-month recall schedule, one with a regular dental environment (RDE) and one with SADE. Outcomes included physiological measures (heart rate and oxygen saturation) and cooperation (Frankl scores). RESULTS Study subjects completed 36 visits. None of the physiological measures differed at either time point between the two treatment settings. The Frankl scores were significantly higher with SADE setting than RDE (P = 0.0368). Forty-six percent of parents strongly agreed that they would prefer the SADE for their child's next visit. CONCLUSION SADE may be associated with improved behavior in children with DD.", " Laparoscopic Roux-Y gastric bypass (LRYGBP) is the gold-standard procedure for the treatment of morbid obesity. It has been reported to be somewhat more efficient and durable than laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). However, it is considered more invasive and, therefore, more hazardous. There is a lack of unity in complication reporting following bariatric surgery. Thus, there is a possible misconception regarding the relative safety of the two major bariatric procedures performed worldwide. This may have contributed to a shift in practice with LSG gaining momentum \"at the expense\" of LRYGBP. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relative safety of primary LSG and LRYGBP according to the Clavien-Dindo complication grading system. METHODS A total of 2651 and 554 patients underwent primary LSG and LRYGBP, respectively at three high-volume centers. Thirty-day perioperative complications were recorded and graded. Length of hospital stays (LOS) and readmission rates were collected as well. RESULTS Complications occurred in 110 (3.7%) and 24 (4.3%) patients following LSG and LRYGBP, respectively (p = 0.9). No significant difference was found between the groups regarding overall and complication-grade-specific rates. Individual complication types were unevenly distributed, but not significantly so. Patients with complications were older than those without (47 and 43 years, respectively; p = 0.01). Gender was not a risk factor for complication. Median LOS and readmission rates were not significantly different. CONCLUSIONS LSG and LRYGBP are equally safe, at least in the perioperative period. Acknowledging and conveying this finding to surgeons and patients alike is important and might cause a pendulum shift in the distribution of bariatric procedures performed.", "Curative endovascular treatment of sphenoid wing dural arteriovenous fistula (dAVF) with pure cortical venous drainage is challenging because of its rarity, lack of accessible dural sinus for transvenous embolization (TVE), and proximity of skull base vital regions. Direct surgery to disconnect venous reflux has been favored. We report the curative endovascular treatment of two sphenoid wing dAVFs with pure cortical venous drainage. One patient revealed complete obliteration of dAVF by a single session of transarterial embolization (TAE). As part of strategic TAE for this complex dAVF, we used a novel approach to create a complete flow-arrest condition in which coils and an occlusion balloon were combined. A liquid agent was then injected across the pathological fistula and into the parent venous apparatus, thereby occluding the lesion. The other patient was treated with percutaneous TVE after TAE was unsuccessful. With a specific strategy and appropriate devices, the microcatheter was successfully introduced through sigmoid sinus, transverse sinus, superior sagittal sinus, and refluxing cortical vein by puncture of the jugular vein. Coils were deployed at the venous side of the fistula, resulting in successful obliteration of the dAVF. Sphenoid wing dAVF with pure cortical venous drainage could be curable by endovascular treatment with proper strategy and instruments when anatomical condition permits.", " Robotic technology is increasingly adopted in urologic surgery and a variety of techniques has been described for minimally invasive treatment of upper tract urothelial cancer (UTUC). OBJECTIVE To describe a simplified surgical technique of robot-assisted nephroureterectomy (RANU) and to report our single-center surgical outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Patients with history of UTUC treated with this modality between April 2010 and August 2013 were included in the analysis. Institutional review board approval was obtained. Informed consent was signed by all patients. SURGICAL PROCEDURE A simplified single-step RANU not requiring repositioning or robot redocking. Lymph node dissection was performed selectively. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Descriptive analysis of patients' characteristics, perioperative outcomes, histopathology, and short-term follow-up data was performed. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS The analysis included 31 patients (mean age: 72.4\u00b110.6 yr; mean body mass index: 26.6\u00b15.1kg/m(2)). Twenty-six of 30 tumors (86%) were high grade. Mean tumor size was 3.1\u00b11.8cm. Of the 31 patients, 13 (42%) had pT3 stage disease. One periureteric positive margin was noted in a patient with bulky T3 disease. The mean number of lymph nodes removed was 9.4 (standard deviation: 5.6; range: 3-21). Two of 14 patients (14%) had positive lymph nodes on final histology. No patients required a blood transfusion. Six patients experienced complications postoperatively, with only one being a high grade (Clavien 3b) complication. Median hospital stay was 5 d. Within the follow-up period, seven patients experienced bladder recurrences and four patients developed metastatic disease. CONCLUSIONS Our RANU technique eliminates the need for patient repositioning or robot redocking. This technique can be safely reproduced, with surgical outcomes comparable to other established techniques. PATIENT SUMMARY We describe a surgical technique using the da Vinci robot for a minimally invasive treatment of patients presenting with upper tract urothelial cancer. This technique can be safely implemented with good surgical outcomes.", "OBJECTIVE The main concern during transfemoral carotid artery stenting (CAS) is preventing cerebral embolus dislodgement. We compared clinical outcomes and intraprocedural embolization rates of CAS using a distal filter protection device or proximal balloon occlusion device. METHODS From January 2011 to March 2015, a series of 58 patients with symptomatic or asymptomatic internal carotid artery stenosis \u226570% were treated with CAS with embolic protection device in single center. All patients underwent post-CAS diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) to detect new ischemic lesions. We compared clinical outcomes and postprocedural embolization rates. RESULTS CAS was performed in all 61 patients. Distal filter protection success rate was 96.6% (28/29), whose mean age was 70.9 years, and mean stenosis was 81%. Their preprocedural infarction rate was 39% (11/28). Subsequent DW-MRI revealed 96 new ischemic lesions in 71% (20/28) patients. In contrast, the proximal balloon occlusion device success rate was 93.8% (30/32), whose mean age was 68.8 years and mean stenosis was 86%. Preprocedure infarction rate was 47% (14/30). DW-MRI revealed 45 new ischemic lesions in 57% (17/30) patients. Compared with distal filter protection device, proximal balloon occlusion device resulted in fewer ischemic lesions per patient (p=0.028). In each group, type of stent during CAS had no significant effect on number of periprocedural embolisms. Only 2 neurologic events occurred in the successfully treated patients (one from each group). CONCLUSION Transfemoral CAS with proximal balloon occlusion device achieves good results. Compared with distal filter protection, proximal balloon occlusion might be more effective in reducing cerebral embolism during CAS.", "EUS-guided fine-needle ethanol injection (FNI) therapy of some types of cystic and solid tumors has been documented. However, reported cases to date of gastrointestinal-stromal tumors (GIST) treated with this technique are scarce. Ethanol ablation is an alternative treatment with a low rate of adverse events in selected cases.", "PURPOSE Flow diverters are increasingly used in the treatment of complex and giant intracranial aneurysms. However, they are associated with complications like late aneurysmal rupture. Additionally, flow diverters show focal structural decrease in luminal diameter without any intimal hyperplasia. This resembles a \"fish mouth\" when viewed en face. In this pilot study, we tested the hypothesis of a possible association between flow diverter fish-mouthing and delayed-type hypersensitivity to its metal constituents. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed patient records from our center between May 2010 and November 2015. A total of nine patients had flow diverter fish mouthing. A control group of 25 patients was selected. All study participants underwent prospective patch test to detect hypersensitivity to flow diverter metal constituents. Analysis was performed using logistic regression analysis and Wilcoxon sign rank sum test. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to test variables to predict flow diverter fish mouthing. RESULTS The association between flow diverter fish mouthing and positive patch test was not statistically significant. In multivariate analysis, history of allergy and maximum aneurysm size category was associated with flow diverter fish mouthing. This was further confirmed on Wilcoxon sign rank sum test. CONCLUSION The study showed statistically significant association between flow diverter fish mouthing and history of contact allergy and a small aneurysmal size. Further large-scale studies are needed to detect a statistically significant association between flow diverter fish mouthing and patch test. We recommend early and more frequent follow-up imaging in patients with contact allergy to detect flow diverter fish mouthing and its subsequent evolution.", " Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) are treatment options for aortic stenosis in patients with prior coronary artery bypass graft surgery. We assessed the major clinical outcomes of such patients enrolled in the CoreValve High Risk (CHR) study. METHODS Of the 795 CHR study patients, 226 had prior coronary artery bypass graft surgery; 115 underwent TAVR and 111 underwent SAVR. The primary endpoint was a comparison of all-cause mortality at 1 year. Important secondary clinical endpoints were assessed. RESULTS At 1 year, all-cause mortality was 9.6% for TAVR versus 18.1% for SAVR (p = 0.06); cardiovascular mortality was 7.0% for TAVR versus 13.8% for SAVR (p = 0.09). A combination of The Society of Thoracic Surgeons risk score greater than 7 and age greater than 80 years was a significant predictor of mortality, with TAVR demonstrating a survival advantage (p = 0.03). No differences were seen for stroke. The SAVR group had longer intensive care unit and hospital stays, increased incidence of acute kidney injury, life-threatening or disabling bleeding, and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (p < 0.05). Pacemaker implantation and paravalvular regurgitation were greater with TAVR at all timepoints. CONCLUSIONS For patients with prior coronary artery bypass graft surgery and aortic stenosis, TAVR offers a significant morbidity advantage and a strong trend toward improved survival over SAVR at 1 year.", "Recent attention to the increasing incidence of venous thromboembolism has included a call to action from the surgeon general and new guidelines from various specialty organizations. The standard of care for treatment of deep venous thrombosis in the emergency department (ED), supported by the 2008 American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines, involves initiation of anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin, pentasaccharide, or unfractionated heparin. For selected appropriate patients with extensive acute proximal deep venous thrombosis, the ACCP guidelines now recommend thrombolysis in addition to anticoagulation to reduce not only the risk of pulmonary embolism but also the risk of subsequent postthrombotic syndrome and recurrent deep venous thrombosis. Postthrombotic syndrome is a potentially debilitating chronic cluster of lower-extremity symptoms occurring in 20% to 50% of deep venous thrombosis patients subsequent to the acute insult, sometimes not until years later. A strategy of early thrombus burden reduction or frank removal might reduce the incidence of postthrombotic syndrome, as per natural history studies, venous thrombectomy data, observations after systemic and catheter-directed thrombolysis, and the still-limited number of randomized trials of catheter-directed thrombolysis (with anticoagulation) versus anticoagulation alone. Contemporary invasive (endovascular) treatments mitigate the drawbacks historically associated with thrombolytic approaches by means of intrathrombus delivery of drugs with greater fibrin specificity and lower allergenicity, followed by mechanical dispersion to accelerate lysis and then aspiration of remaining drug and clot debris. With a 2016 target completion date, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute--sponsored Acute Venous Thrombosis: Thrombus Removal With Adjunctive Catheter-Directed Thrombolysis trial is comparing the safety and efficacy, in terms of both deep venous thrombosis and postthrombotic syndrome parameters, of the most evolved pharmacomechanical catheter-directed thrombolysis devices versus standard anticoagulation therapy alone. This article reviews the grounds for use of adjunctive thrombolysis in patients with acute proximal deep venous thrombosis and begins to identify types of deep venous thrombosis patients encountered in the ED who might benefit most from multidisciplinary consideration of early referral for possible endovascular therapy.", " The most common technique described for robotic ventral hernia repair (RVHR) is intraperitoneal onlay mesh (IPOM). With the evolution of robotics, advanced techniques including retro rectus mesh reinforcement, and component separation are being popularized. However, these procedures require more dissection, and longer operative times. In this study we reviewed our experience with robotic ventral/incisional hernia repair (RVHR) with hernia defect closure (HDC) and IPOM. METHODS Retrospective chart review and follow-up of 31 consecutive cases of ventral/incisional hernia treated between August 2011 and December 2018. Demographics, operative times, blood loss, length of stay (LOS), hernia size, location, and type, mesh size and type, recurrence, conversion to open ventral hernia repair (OVHR) and complications including bleeding, seroma formation and infection were analyzed. RESULTS Mean age was 63.9 years old, with median BMI of 31.24 kg/m2. Median hernia area was 17 cm2. Mean operating time was 142.61 min (SD 59.79). Mean LOS was 1.46 days (range 1-5), with 48% being outpatient, and overnight stay in 32% for pain control. Conversion was necessary in 12.9% cases. Complication rate was 3% for enterotomy. Recurrence was 14.81% after a mean follow-up of 26.96 months. There was significant association of recurrence with COPD history (P = 0.0215) and multiple hernia defects (P = 0.0376). CONCLUSION Our recurrence rate (14.81%) compares favorably to those reported in literature (16.7%) for LVHR with HDC and IPOM. Our experience also indicates that IPOM is associated with satisfactory outcomes, low conversion and complications rates, and short LOS.", "STUDY OBJECTIVE To compare robotic-assisted laparoscopy with conventional laparoscopy for treatment of advanced stage endometriosis insofar as operative time, estimated blood loss, complication rate, and length of hospital stay. STUDY DESIGN Retrospective cohort study (Canadian Task Force classification II2). All procedures were performed by one surgeon between January 2004 and July 2012. Data was collected via chart review. SETTING Tertiary referral center for treatment of endometriosis. PATIENTS Four hundred twenty women with advanced endometriosis. INTERVENTIONS Fertility-sparing surgery to treat advanced endometriosis, either via conventional or robotic-assisted laparoscopy. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Patient demographic data, operative time, estimated blood loss, complication rate, and length of hospital stay were compared between the 2 groups. Two hundred seventy-three patients underwent conventional laparoscopy and 147 patients underwent robotic-assisted laparoscopy for fertility-sparing treatment of advanced stage endometriosis. Patients in both groups had similar characteristics insofar as age, body mass index, and previous abdominal surgeries. There were no significant differences in blood loss or complication rate between the 2 groups. Mean operative time in the conventional laparoscopy group was 135 minutes (range, 115-156 minutes), and in the robotic-assisted laparoscopy group was 196 minutes (range, 185-209 minutes), with a mean difference in operative time of 61 minutes (p < .001). Length of hospital stay was also significantly increased in the robotic-assisted laparoscopy group. Most patients who underwent conventional laparoscopy were discharged to home on the day of surgery. Of 273 patients in the conventional laparoscopy group, only 63 remained in the hospital overnight, and all 147 patients in the robotic-assisted laparoscopy group were discharged on postoperative day 1. CONCLUSION Conventional laparoscopy and robotic-assisted laparoscopy are excellent methods for treatment of advanced stages of endometriosis. However, use of the robotic platform may increase operative time and might also be associated with longer hospital stay.", " Optimal obesity therapy is a matter of debate. Besides weight reduction, other criteria such as safety and nutritional status are of relevance. Therefore, we compared a favored surgical intervention with the most effective conservative treatment regarding anthropometry and nutritional status. METHODS Fifty-four obese patients were included who underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG, n = 27) or a 52-week multidisciplinary intervention program (MIP, n = 27) for weight loss. Body weight, body composition assessed by bioelectrical impedance analysis, and serum protein levels were measured before and within 12 months after intervention. RESULTS After 1 year of observation, excess weight loss was more pronounced following LSG (65 %) compared to MIP (38 %, p < 0.001). In both groups, body fat was clearly reduced, but a higher reduction occurred in the LSG group. However, protein status deteriorated particularly in the LSG group. Within 1 year, body cell mass declined from 37.1 to 26.9 kg in the LSG group, but only from 35.7 to 32.2 kg in the MIP group. This resulted in an increased mean extracellular mass/body cell mass ratio (1.42 versus 1.00, p < 0.001), in a decreased mean phase angle (4.4\u00b0 versus 6.6\u00b0, p < 0.001), and in a lower prealbumin level in serum (p < 0.02) in the LSG group compared to the MIP group. CONCLUSIONS LSG, compared to MIP, was more effective regarding excess weight loss and body fat loss within 1 year, however, induced more pronounced muscle mass and protein loss, possibly requiring particular interventions such as exercise or protein supplements.", "OBJECTIVE Early intervention is desirable in patients presenting with stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) referable to carotid artery stenosis because of the high incidence of recurrent ischemic events within 48 h post-ictus. However, the optimal timing of performing carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) in these patients remains unclear amid concerns for an elevated risk of perioperative complications. The primary outcome of this study was the combined incidence of major perioperative complications (stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), death) based on timing of CAS relative to symptom onset. METHODS A prospectively maintained database of all neuroendovascular procedures at our hospital was searched for consecutive cases of extracranial internal CAS procedures performed for symptomatic atherosclerotic carotid stenosis between January 2009 and January 2012. Rates of perioperative complications including 30-day stroke, MI and death were assembled in a total of 221 patients. RESULTS The primary outcome was not statistically different among groups stratified based on intervention timing, with a combined incidence of stroke, MI or death of 7.1% in patients treated within 2 days, 4.5% in patients treated between days 3 and 7, 2.8% in patients treated between days 8 and 14 and 3.7% in patients treated between days 15 and 90 (p=0.749, Fisher exact test). CONCLUSIONS Our results support the conclusion that early CAS (within 2 days) carries no additional risks compared with CAS after 2 days or any other timing of the intervention up to 90 days. Early CAS may represent a reasonable option for acute revascularization to minimize the risk of perioperative stroke and overall perioperative complications.", "Endovascular treatment for stroke: when does the window for good outcome close?", "OBJECTIVE The incidence, health and economic impacts of influenza-like illness (ILI) among the working population in Hong Kong had never been studied. Due to the nature of the disease, ILIs can have a significant impact on the operation of a corporation in terms of loss of productivity and reduced work performance. The present study was undertaken to determine the health and economic impacts of ILIs under different environmental conditions on the working population of a large corporation. METHOD Over 2,000 employees of a large corporation in the travelling and tourism industry were studied with three different types of working environment (confined, typical office and well ventilated) by two structured questionnaires. RESULTS The most affected group in terms of productivity and health was the group working in a confined area, whilst those working in a well-ventilated area were least affected. However, symptoms of the confined area group seemed to disappear faster. The infection rate appeared to vary according to work environment for the studied population. CONCLUSION Policies on preventive measures and early treatment are important for a corporation to reduce loss in productivity due to ILIs.", "Septic systems are typically designed to treat domestic wastewater from households without access to centralized facilities. The installation of a food waste disposer (FWD) may increase the discharge of food waste (FW) into the wastewater; therefore, the installation of a FWD is discouraged in households that have a septic system. This study was conducted to determine how a typical dose of FW from a FWD can affect the performance of a septic system in terms of sewage treatment and solids accumulation. A 20-L control tank was compared with an experiment tank to which FW was added, increasing the amount of total suspended solids (TSS) by 31.3% and total chemical oxygen demands by 46.3% for a period of 110 days. Although the influent water quality changed dramatically, the effluent from the experiment tank had a substantially lower percentage increase in water quality parameters compared with the effluent from the control. It was found that in the experiment tank, 75.8% of FW TSS was degraded, whereas only 36.7% of sewage TSS was degraded, and that 18.8% of FW TSS and 44.9% of sewage TSS accumulated in the experiment tank. The addition of FW increased the scum accumulation, even though the dry matter of the scum layer was much less in quantity than the sludge layer. It also increased the lipid content in the sludge. The increase in the scum layer was mainly due to the increase in protein from the addition of the FW. Overall, compared with sewage TSS, FW TSS tends to be more biodegradable, which indicates that the impact on pumping frequency from adding FW will be insignificant.", " Stent migration is a common complication in treating trachea stenosis. There is no report concerning suture fixation of tracheal stent. The aim of this study was to investigate whether suture fixation of tracheal stent could avoid stent migration in patients with upper trachea stenosis. The complications were further investigated. METHODS The patients with upper trachea stenosis who underwent tracheal stent placement for benign/malignant conditions in our hospital between May 2016 and April 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical data were collected for each patient, including age, gender, co-morbid diseases, site of tracheal obstruction, degree of tracheal obstruction, success of stent placement, impact on patient's symptoms, complications, etc. RESULTS: Eleven patients (8 males and 3 females; range of age: 17-85, and average age of 63) were enrolled into this study. Six silicone stents and five membrane-covered metal stents were used. The surgery was successfully performed in all the cases. The postoperative recovery was uneventful. All symptoms of the patients were relieved. No complications occurred. The average follow-up for patients was 5 months (range of 1-13 months). During the follow-up, no stent migration was observed according to CT and bronchoscope. CONCLUSION The results suggested that suture fixation of stents could avoid stent migration in treating upper trachea stenosis with metal stent or silicone stent. This method seemed to be effective without operation complications.", "PURPOSE OF REVIEW To assess the safety and bleeding risk in men on chronic oral anticoagulation, including antiplatelet therapies, undergoing bladder outlet procedures for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). RECENT FINDINGS There are conflicting findings; however, most recent series show that when treating bladder outlet obstruction from BPH in patients on chronic anticoagulants, there is an increased risk of hemorrhagic complications for these men. There is also an increased risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications, especially when antithrombotic therapy is used for secondary prevention and is withdrawn perioperatively. Some have found bipolar electrosurgical vaporization of the prostate, laser vaporization, and enucleation of the prostate to provide superior hemostatic outcomes compared to classic monopolar transurethral resection of the prostate. SUMMARY Extra caution should always be given to patients on chronic anticoagulation undergoing surgical procedures, given increased risk of bleeding and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications. For men with BPH undergoing bladder outlet procedures, photoselective vaporization of the prostate, Holmium laser enucleation of the prostate, and vaporization of the prostate with bipolar electrosurgical instruments may result in less bleeding complications. Further prospective randomized studies are needed to elucidate which methods provide better hemostasis and lower postoperative bleeding to best manage men with BPH on chronic antithrombotic therapy, especially when the anticoagulation therapy cannot be discontinued prior to therapy.", " The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical differences in wound complications after total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) between a cohort of patients that received a compression wrap protocol and a historical control group treated with cast immobilization. METHODS Patient charts and postoperative wound pictures were reviewed for 42 patients who underwent a compression wrap protocol and 50 patients who underwent circumferential casting after primary TAA from 2008 to 2013. A blinded reviewer graded each wound using a novel postoperative wound classification system, and recorded whether the wound was completely healed by or after 3 months. A second blinded review was performed to determine intraobserver reliability. Mean patient age was 55 years (range, 24-80) and all patients had at least 6-month follow-up. RESULTS There were significantly more total wound complications (P = .02) and mild wound complications (P = .02) in the casted group compared to the compression wrap group. There were no significant differences in the number of moderate and severe complications between each group. A significantly higher proportion of TAA incisions took longer than 3 months to heal in the casted group (P = .02). CONCLUSIONS Based on our clinical experience with postoperative wound care after TAA, use of a compression wrap protocol was safe and effective at reducing wound-related complications, and well tolerated by patients. Further prospective, randomized clinical trials are warranted to evaluate the utility and cost-effectiveness of a compression wrap protocol after TAA.", "Lung injury limits the success of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). The overall incidence varies from 30 to 50% and non-infectious causes occur in one-third to one-half of these. We reviewed pulmonary complications in 369 consecutive patients who received a partially T-cell-depleted myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic SCT at our institution between 1993 and 2003. All patients were treated uniformly with cyclophosphamide followed by total body irradiation. Control subjects were matched on sex, underlying diagnosis, age, type of transplantation and cytomegalovirus (CMV)-serostatus. Sixty-one patients (16.5%) developed pulmonary complications. Twenty-one patients (5.7%) developed infectious pneumonia. Forty patients developed non-infectious complications which were further subclassified as bronchiolitis obliterans (3.5%), bronchiolitis obliterans-organizing pneumonia (0.5%), diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (0.8%), idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (5.5%) or mixed etiology (0.5%). Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) \u2a7egrade II was significantly more common in pulmonary patients than in the controls (36/61 versus 22/61 patients, P=0.02). There was no significant difference in the incidence of chronic GVHD (P=0.09). CMV reactivation was significantly more frequent in patients with lung injury (P=0.02). Median survival was 41 weeks for the pulmonary patients and 350 weeks for the controls (P=0.001). Altogether, the incidence of pulmonary complications is low after T-cell-depleted SCT and is associated with acute GVHD and CMV reactivation.", "PURPOSE Laparoscopic ventral hernia repair (LVHR) is associated with shorter hospitalization and lower complication rates compared to open ventral hernia repair. We sought to determine if hernia-related factors, such as defect size and re-operative status correlate with postoperative complications, operative times and length of stay (LOS). METHODS The study is a retrospective review of 30-day perioperative outcomes following LVHR in 91 patients who underwent surgery at a single institution from August 2009 through June 2012. A single surgeon performed all procedures. RESULTS Indications for surgery were recurrent incisional hernia in 33 % of patients and primary incisional or ventral abdominal hernias in the rest. Coated polyester mesh with an average size of 348 cm(2) (\u00b1214; range 113-1,036) was used. Mean operative time was 132 min (\u00b166.1; range 53-412). The mean LOS was 4.0 days (\u00b13.5; range 1-22). Complications occurred in 13 patients for overall morbidity of 16.5 % and no mortality. There was one recurrence in 30 days (1.1 %). Patients who had a surgery >120 min or a LOS >1 day were statistically more likely to have multiple hernias, larger defect sizes (>40 cm(2)), larger mesh sizes (>300 cm(2)) or a history of recurrent hernia (P < 0.05). No other clinical or demographic variable evaluated in this study correlated with operative time or LOS. CONCLUSIONS LVHR is safe with a low incidence of perioperative complications. Patients with multiple, larger and recurrent hernias have longer operative times and LOS. This information can be used to guide preoperative planning for the patient, surgeon and treating institution.", "Background An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been widely spread. We aim to investigate the therapeutic effect of arbidol and moxifloxacin in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Methods We collected and analyzed data on 94 patients with COVID-19 including 27 severe patients at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and 74 ordinary patients at general isolation ward in Wuhan Xiehe Hospital, from February 15, 2020 to March 15, 2020. All patients were treated with arbidol (100mg each time, three times a day for 14 days) and moxifloxacin (0.4g each time, once a day for 7-14 days). Other data was also collected including demographic data, symptoms, laboratory findings, treatments and clinical outcomes. Results In basic characteristics, compared with the ordinary patients, the severe patients were older (median age was 63.0 years V.S 57.0 years, p=0.03), had higher proportion of hypertension (30% V.S 9%, p=0.03), higher possibility of getting fatigue and/or myalgia (26% V.S 6%, p=0.03), and had more obvious dyspnea symptom (26% V.S 3%, p=0.006). In regarding to laboratory results, we found the severe patients have higher white blood cell counts (p=0.003), neutrophil counts (p=0.007), higher levels of D-dimer (p<0.001), ALT (p<0.001) and AST (p=0.013) than the ordinary patients. After treatment of arbidol and moxifloxacin for one week, the rates of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid turning negative were 69.2% in the severe group and 77.8% in the ordinary group. A peculiar phenomenon was that IL-6 stands out among the cytokines in both groups, and higher in severe group than the ordinary one (p=0.011). After treating with arbidol and moxifloxacin for one week, IL-6 decreased significantly in severe group (p=0.023). Conclusion In summary, we proved the treatment of arbidol and moxifloxacin could be helpful in reducing viral load and inflammation during SARS-CoV2 infection, especially for negatively regulating fatal inflammation in severe COVID-19 patients. However, more evidence awaits further clinical verification.", "This is a protocol for a Cochrane Review (Intervention). The objectives are as follows: To assess the effectiveness and safety of yoga for treatment of urinary incontinence in women, compared to no specific treatment, to another active treatment, or to an active treatment without adjuvant yoga, with a focus on patient symptoms and quality of life.", " Some patients develop recurrence after curative resection and adjuvant chemotherapy. S-1, an oral fluoropyrimidine, is one of the standard regimens in adjuvant chemotherapy, and is also used in first-line treatment for advanced/metastatic gastric cancer. It is controversial as to whether the same treatment strategy can be applied for patients who develop recurrence after adjuvant chemotherapy and those who did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy. To investigate this issue, we compared the outcomes of patients who developed recurrences after treatment with or without adjuvant chemotherapy using the results of the Adjuvant Chemotherapy Trial of S-1 for Gastric Cancer (ACTS-GC). METHODS Patients who had confirmed recurrence in the ACTS-GC trial were analyzed. We defined 2 independent cohorts. Cohort 1 patients were divided by whether they received adjuvant chemotherapy (adjuvant S-1 group and surgery-only group). Cohort 2 patients were divided by whether they received a regimen including S-1 (IS) or not including S-1 (NIS) after recurrence. RESULTS A total of 375 patients experienced recurrence (160 in the adjuvant S-1 group and 215 in the surgery-only group). In cohort 1, the median time from recurrence to death (TFRD) was 11.4 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.4-13.9) in the adjuvant S-1 group and 11.3 months (95% CI, 9.7-13.1) in the surgery-only group (hazard ratio [HR], 1.05; 95% CI, 0.84-1.31). In cohort 2, 292 patients received chemotherapy after recurrence and were divided into the IS (n = 189) or the NIS group (n = 103). The median TFRD was 13.9 months (95% CI, 12.7-15.6) in the IS group and 8.1 months (95% CI, 6.6-9.7) in the NIS group (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.45-0.76), and there was no significant interaction between the adjuvant S-1 group and surgery-only group. CONCLUSION Adjuvant chemotherapy with S-1 prolonged overall survival without influencing the TFRD. The same treatment strategy may be applied for patients who develop recurrence after adjuvant chemotherapy and those who did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy. TRIAL REGISTRATION NCT00152217 . First Posted on September 9, 2005.", "Foodborne illnesses associated with contaminated fresh produce are a common public health problem and there is an upward trend of outbreaks caused by enteric viruses, especially human noroviruses (HNoVs) and hepatitis A virus (HAV). This study aimed to assess the use of DNase and RNase coupled to qPCR and RT-qPCR, respectively, to detect intact particles of human adenoviruses (HAdVs), HNoV GI and GII and HAV in fresh produce. Different concentrations of DNase and RNase were tested to optimize the degradation of free DNA and RNA from inactivated HAdV and murine norovirus (MNV), respectively. Results indicated that 10 \u00b5g/ml of RNase was able to degrade more than 4 log10 (99.99%) of free RNA, and 1 U of DNase degraded the range of 0.84-2.5 log10 of free DNA depending on the fresh produce analysed. The treatment with nucleases coupled to (RT)-qPCR was applied to detect potential infectious virus in organic lettuce, green onions and strawberries collected in different seasons. As a result, no intact particles of HNoV GI and GII were detected in the 36 samples analysed, HAdV was found in one sample and HAV was present in 33.3% of the samples, without any reasonable distribution pattern among seasons. In conclusion, RT-qPCR preceded by RNase treatment of eluted samples from fresh produce is a good alternative to detect undamaged RNA viruses and therefore, potential infectious viruses. Moreover, this study provides data about the prevalence of enteric viruses in organic fresh produce from Brazil.", " Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) represents a common female pelvic floor disorder that has a serious impact on quality of life. Several types of procedures with different surgical approaches have been described to correct these defects, but the optimal management is still debated. OBJECTIVE To describe our surgical technique of robot-assisted sacrocolpopexy (RASC) for POP and to assess its safety and long-term outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A retrospective review of the medical records of 95 consecutive patients who underwent RASC for POP at our centre from April 2006 to December 2011 was performed. SURGICAL PROCEDURE RASC with use of polypropylene meshes was performed in all cases using a standardised technique with the da Vinci Surgical System (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) in a four-arm configuration. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Clinical data were collected in a dedicated database. Intraoperative variables, postoperative complications, and outcomes of RASC were assessed. A descriptive statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS Median operative time was 101 min. No conversion to open surgery was needed. One vaginal and two bladder injuries occurred and were repaired intraoperatively. Only one Clavien grade 3 postoperative complication was observed (bowel obstruction treated laparoscopically). At a median follow-up of 34 mo, persistent POP was observed in four cases (4.2%). One mesh erosion occurred and required robot-assisted removal of the mesh. Ten (10.5%) patients complained de novo urgency after RASC, which resolved in the first few weeks after surgery. No significant de novo bowel or sexual symptoms were reported. CONCLUSIONS Our technique of RASC for correction of POP is safe and effective, with limited risk of complications and good long-term results in the treatment of all types of POP. The robotic surgical system facilitates precise and accurate placement of the meshes with short operative time, thereby favouring wider diffusion of minimally invasive treatment of POP. PATIENT SUMMARY We studied the treatment of patients with vaginal prolapse by using a robot-assisted surgical technique to fix the vaginal wall with a synthetic mesh. This technique was found to be safe and effective, with limited risk of complications and good long-term results.", "Numerous grounds have been offered for the view that healthcare workers have a duty to treat, including expressed consent, implied consent, special training, reciprocity (also called the social contract view), and professional oaths and codes. Quite often, however, these grounds are simply asserted without being adequately defended or without the defenses being critically evaluated. This essay aims to help remedy that problem by providing a critical examination of the strengths and weaknesses of each of these five grounds for asserting that healthcare workers have a duty to treat, especially as that duty would arise in the context of an infectious disease pandemic. Ultimately, it argues that none of the defenses is currently sufficient to ground the kind of duty that would be needed in a pandemic. It concludes by sketching some practical recommendations in that regard.", " Objective Identify clinical and radiographic features of venous infarct as a presenting feature of COVID-19 in the young. Background SARS-CoV-2 infection causes hypercoagulability and inflammation leading to venous thrombotic events (VTE). Although elderly patients with comorbidities are at higher risk, COVID-19 may also cause VTE in a broader patient population without these risks. Neurologic complications and manifestations of COVID-19, including neuropathies, seizures, strokes and encephalopathy usually occur in severe established cases of COVID-19 infection who primarily present with respiratory distress. Case description : Case report of a 29-year-old woman, with no significant past medical history or comorbidities, presenting with new onset seizures. Further questioning revealed a one-week history of headaches, low-grade fever, mild cough and shortness of breath, diagnosed as COVID-19. Imaging revealed a left temporoparietal hemorrhagic venous infarction with left transverse and sigmoid sinus thrombosis treated with full dose anticoagulation and antiepileptics. Conclusion Although elderly patients with comorbidities are considered highest risk for COVID-19 neurologic complications, usually when systemic symptoms are severe, this case report emphasizes that young individuals are at risk for VTE with neurologic complications even when systemic symptoms are mild, likely induced by COVID-19 associated hypercoagulable state.", "PURPOSE OF REVIEW Portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG) and gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE) are two types of upper gastrointestinal bleeding that may present similarly, but are managed very differently. This article reviews the pathogenesis and guidelines in management of both of these conditions with emphasis on recent advances in the field. RECENT FINDINGS Off-label use of Hemospray has been shown in several case series to be useful in managing acute bleeding from PHG. Balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration presents an alternative approach for this condition. Radiofrequency ablation may be an alternative therapy to argon plasma coagulation in the endoscopic treatment of GAVE, as it consists of fewer sessions and has been shown to decrease gastrointestinal blood loss. SUMMARY The treatment options for PHG and GAVE are constantly evolving and expanding. In this review, we present the latest approaches in the gastroenterologist's arsenal to deal with these conditions.", "Background and purpose In patients with acute ischemic stroke who receive antiplatelet treatment, uncertainty exists about the effect and safety of intra-arterial treatment. Our aim was to study whether intra-arterial treatment in patients with prior antiplatelet treatment is safe and whether prior antiplatelet treatment modifies treatment effect. Methods All 500 MR CLEAN patients were included. We estimated the effect of intra-arterial treatment with ordinal logistic regression analysis, and tested for interaction of antiplatelet treatment with intra-arterial treatment on outcome. Furthermore, safety parameters and serious adverse events were analyzed. Results The 144 patients (29%) on antiplatelet treatment were older, more often male, and had more vascular comorbidity. Intra-arterial treatment effect size after adjustments in antiplatelet treatment patients was 1.7 (95% confidence interval 0.9-3.2), and in no antiplatelet treatment patients 1.8 (95% confidence interval: 1.2-2.6). There was no statistically or clinically significant interaction between prior antiplatelet treatment and the relative effect of intra-arterial treatment ( p = 0.78). However, in patients on antiplatelet treatment, the effect of successful reperfusion on functional outcome in the intervention arm of the trial was doubled: the absolute risk difference for favorable outcome after successful reperfusion in patients on prior antiplatelet treatment was 39% versus 18% in patients not on prior antiplatelet treatment (Pinteraction = 0.025). Patients on antiplatelet treatment more frequently had a symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (15%) compared to patients without antiplatelet treatment (4%), without differences between the control and intervention arm. Conclusions Prior treatment with antiplatelet agents did not modify the effect of intra-arterial treatment in patients with acute ischemic stroke presenting with an intracranial large vessel occlusion. There were no safety concerns. In patients with reperfusion, antiplatelet agents may improve functional outcome.", "PURPOSE To describe the impairments in physical fitness in individuals who were previously diagnosed and treated for childhood cancer. METHODS Using the PRISMA-guidelines, a systematic search was performed in PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase using a combination of the following predefined keywords: \"exercise capacity\" OR \"aerobic capacity\" OR \"fitness\" OR \"cardiorespiratory fitness\" OR \"cardiopulmonary fitness\" OR \"physical fitness\" OR \"exercise testing\" OR \"exercise tolerance\" OR \"exercise\" OR \"oxygen consumption\" AND \"leukemia\" OR \"childhood cancer\" OR \"childhood cancer survivors (CCS)\". Studies that met our inclusion criteria were reviewed on methodological quality, while the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used for evidence synthesis. RESULTS A total of 2644 articles were identified from the database search. After screening based on the eligibility (abstracts) and inclusion (full texts) criteria, 49 articles remained. Even though the risk-of-bias scores in the studies were generally low, yet the results from those with high-quality studies revealed that poor fitness levels were prevalent in individuals with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, brain tumor, and mixed cancer histories, compared to healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS A global glance at CCS shows poor levels of fitness that is continuous and life-long even after active cancer treatment has ended. Nevertheless, the results presented in this review were based on a limited number of high-quality studies suggesting the need to for additional clinical trials in the topic area.", "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused more than 200,000 reported COVID-19 cases in Spain resulting in more than 20,800 deaths as of April 21, 2020. Faecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from COVID-19 patients has extensively been reported. Therefore, we investigated the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in six wastewater treatments plants (WWTPs) serving the major municipalities within the Region of Murcia (Spain), the area with the lowest COVID-19 prevalence within Iberian Peninsula. Firstly, an aluminum hydroxide adsorption-precipitation concentration method was validated using a porcine coronavirus (Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus, PEDV) and mengovirus (MgV). The procedure resulted in average recoveries of 10 \u00b1 3.5% and 10 \u00b1 2.1% in influent water (n = 2) and 3.3 \u00b1 1.6% and 6.2 \u00b1 1.0% in effluent water (n = 2) samples for PEDV and MgV, respectively. Then, the method was used to monitor the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 from March 12 to April 14, 2020 in influent, secondary and tertiary effluent water samples. By using the real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) Diagnostic Panel validated by US CDC that targets three regions of the virus nucleocapsid (N) gene, we estimated quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA titers in untreated wastewater samples of 5.4 \u00b1 0.2 log10 genomic copies/L on average. Two secondary water samples resulted positive (2 out of 18) and all tertiary water samples tested as negative (0 out 12). This environmental surveillance data were compared to declared COVID-19 cases at municipality level, revealing that members of the community were shedding SARS-CoV-2 RNA in their stool even before the first cases were reported by local or national authorities in many of the cities where wastewaters have been sampled. The detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater in early stages of the spread of COVID-19 highlights the relevance of this strategy as an early indicator of the infection within a specific population. At this point, this environmental surveillance could be implemented by municipalities right away as a tool, designed to help authorities to coordinate the exit strategy to gradually lift its coronavirus lockdown.", "The annular pancreas in adults is a rare congenital anomaly that is detected after development of complications, such as gastric outlet obstruction, recurrent pancreatitis, and peptic ulcer. Duodenal bypass is the procedure of choice for treating duodenal obstruction caused by the annular pancreas in both children and adults. Duodenoduodenostomy is routinely performed in neonates and children. In adults, duodenojejunostomy or gastrojejunostomy are recommended, because the duodenum is less mobile. We report a case of annular pancreas in a 33-year-old male that was successfully treated with laparoscopic gastrojejunostomy.", "Wuhan, the city in Hubei province in China is in the focus of global community due to the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), formerly known as 2019-nCoV. The virus emerged in humans from Wuhan seafood market probably via zoonotic transmission. Within a few days the virus spread its tentacles rapidly to neighboring cities in China and to different geographical regions through travelers and to some extent by human to human transmission leading to significant disease burden globally. More than 2,00,000 people (including more than 8000 deaths) have been infected with this respiratory illness across 167 countries and territories worldwide leading to a pandemic. The present review provides an outline about emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 from Wuhan, China in 2019\u20132020. We have also provided information about the classification, genome, proteins, clinical presentation of COVID-19, type of clinical specimens to be collected and diagnostic methods adopted to identify the respiratory illness. In addition we have also provided information about transmission dynamics, prevention measures and treatment options that are available at the present. Subsequently, we have given a comprehensive overview of the spread of this infection from China to the other parts of the globe. Management of the ongoing outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 encompassing surveillance, clinical, immunological, genetic and evolutionary investigations are likely to provide the desired results. Joint efforts of global scientific community are needed at this hour in terms of enhancement of research on development of accurate diagnostics, antiviral therapeutics and finally into formation of an effective vaccine against the emerging novel coronavirus.", " Single-port laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (SPSG) is performed routinely in our department as an alternative to a conventional laparoscopic approach. OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to report our surgical results and follow-up outcome after SPSG. SETTING Department of Digestive Minimally Invasive Surgery, Antoine B\u00e9cl\u00e8re Hospital, Assistance Publique-H\u00f4pitaux de Paris, Paris-Saclay University, France. METHODS Data from consecutive patients who underwent SPSG in our institution between August 2010 and July 2015 were prospectively collected and retrospectively analyzed. Patients with more than 1-year follow-up were included in our analysis for weight loss and co-morbidity. RESULTS A total of 1000 patients underwent SPSG during the study period. Median body mass index was 42.6 kg/m\u00b2 (range: 33.8-84.6 kg/m\u00b2). Median operative time was 112 minutes (range: 50-360 min) and decreased over the years. Completion of the procedure required introduction of an extraport in 78 patients (7.8%). Postoperative mortality and morbidity rates were .1% and 8.1%, respectively. Relaparoscopy and/or endoscopic treatment were required to treat intra-abdominal bleeding in 24 patients (2.4%) and staple-line leakage in 28 patients (2.8%). Five hundred forty-six patients were considered for 1-year follow-up evaluation. Mean excess weight loss was 69% after 1 year and 62.2% after 2 years. Incisional hernia from the trocar site occurred in 20 (3.7%) patients. CONCLUSION Sleeve gastrectomy can be routinely performed using a single-incision laparoscopic technique with equivalent outcomes of surgical morbidity and weight loss compared with conventional laparoscopic surgery. Prospective comparative studies are necessary to assess the potential benefits of this minimally-invasive approach.", "PURPOSE To characterize the two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) fractal properties of rectal cancer regional blood flow assessed by using volumetric helical perfusion computed tomography (CT) and to determine its reproducibility. MATERIALS AND METHODS Institutional review board approval and informed consent were obtained. Ten prospective patients (eight men, two women; mean age, 72.3 years) with rectal adenocarcinoma underwent two repeated volumetric helical perfusion CT studies (four-dimensional adaptive spiral mode, 11.4-cm z-axis coverage) without intervening treatment within 24 hours, with regional blood flow derived by using deconvolution analysis. Two-dimensional and 3D fractal analyses of the rectal tumor were performed, after segmentation from surrounding structures by using thresholding, to derive fractal dimension and fractal abundance. Reproducibility was quantitatively assessed by using Bland-Altman statistics. Two-dimensional and 3D lacunarity plots were also generated, allowing qualitative assessment of reproducibility. Statistical significance was at 5%. RESULTS Mean blood flow was 63.50 mL/min/100 mL \u00b1 8.95 (standard deviation). Good agreement was noted between the repeated studies for fractal dimension; mean difference was -0.024 (95% limits of agreement: -0.212, 0.372) for 2D fractal analysis and -0.024 (95% limits of agreement: -0.307, 0.355) for 3D fractal analysis. Mean difference for fractal abundance was -0.355 (95% limits of agreement: -0.869, 1.579) for 2D fractal analysis and -0.043 (95% limits of agreement: -1.154, 1.239) for 3D fractal analysis. The 95% limits of agreement were narrower for 3D than 2D analysis. Lacunarity plots also visually confirmed close agreement between repeat studies. CONCLUSION Regional blood flow in rectal cancer exhibits fractal properties. Good reproducibility was achieved between repeated studies with 2D and 3D fractal analysis.", "OBJECTIVE The aims of this study were to assess locality of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) in cervical carcinoma and examine factors affecting bilateral SLN detection. METHODS This was a retrospective review of SLN data (anatomical location, count and laterality) in patients with early-stage cervical cancer (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IA1 with lymphovascular space invasion to stage IIA) using intraoperative gamma probe and blue dye. The preoperative single-photon emission computed tomography with computed tomography was used to detect laterality, number of the SLNs, and rare locations. Patients were treated between January 2005 to January 2015 at the West Kent Gynaecological Oncology Centre, Maidstone Hospital, Maidstone, United Kingdom. RESULTS A total of 132 women were investigated. The most common SLN location was the external iliac (38.6%) followed by obturator (25.3%) and internal iliac (23.6%) regions. A small percentage was identified in presacral (1.4%) and para-aortic regions (0.7%). Older age (P = 0.01) and an elevated body mass index (P = 0.03) were associated with decreased SLN count by preoperative single-photon emission computed tomography with computed tomography, and only age affected SLN count by gamma probe (P = 0.01). Initial surgery, large loop excision of the transformation zone, or cone biopsy of the cervix had no effect on SLN count. There was no difference observed in bilateral detection with respect to surgical approach (open: n = 48/laparoscopic: n = 84). However, older age was independently associated with a decrease in bilateral SLN detection (P = 0.003). In these patients who underwent unilateral full pelvic lymphadenectomy, all the nonsentinel nodes were negative. CONCLUSIONS The majority of SLNs were located in the external iliac, obturator, and internal iliac regions. Both older age and an elevated body mass index were associated with a reduced SLN count. Unilateral detection of SLN was independently associated with older age, which may be due to sclerosis in the lymphatic vessels or reduced perfusion in the pelvis in these women. If no SLN is detected on one side, the consensus is to perform a full pelvic lymphadenectomy on that side of the pelvis.", " Congenital pigmented nevi of the auricle are uncommon. The authors' approach is to excise these nevi and perform reconstruction because of the risk of malignant transformation and the aesthetic and psychological effects these nevi can have on the child. This study presents the authors' experience in treating congenital nevi of the ear and suggests treatment principles and guidelines for the reconstructive surgeon. METHODS Fourteen patients with congenital nevus of the ear were treated from October of 1992 to September of 2008 by the senior surgeon (B.S.B.). Nevi involving the more stable areas such as the concha can be resected and grafted early; the antihelix, scapha, and triangular fossa area can be resected and grafted next; and the helical rim, having the most easily distorted cartilage, should be treated last. Lobule reconstruction requires combined flaps and a dermal fat graft or a postauricular fascial fat flap. RESULTS Successful reconstruction was achieved in 10 patients. Three patients require final revision procedures (lobule reconstruction). One patient, early in our series, developed a deformed helical rim resulting from skin grafting at age 16 months, before the cartilage was firm enough to withstand the contraction forces of the skin graft. All subsequent patients with helical rim involvement had treatment delayed until the ear was at or near completion of its growth. CONCLUSIONS Congenital nevi of the ear present a challenging reconstruction surgeon. The authors developed a treatment plan that breaks the ear down to aesthetic units and considers the location of the nevus, patient age, and the firmness of the cartilage.", " Port-site metastases (PSMs) are a rare occurrence after robotic surgery. For robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC), isolated cases have been reported but management has not been previously described. We present a case of PSM that occurred after RARC and report the results of our systematic review of previously reported PSMs and describe the treatment options. Search Criteria and Methods: We describe a case of a PSM in a 55-year-old man who had undergone intracorporeal RARC. We performed a systematic review of MEDLINE and Embase databases for previously reported PSMs, detailing the stage and grade of the primary tumor, time to presentation of PSM, treatment offered, and outcomes for the identified cases. RESULTS We identified 4 cases of PSMs after RARC in published studies and also included our case for analysis. All 5 patients had muscle-invasive bladder cancer at cystectomy (stage \u2265 T2) and 3 had local lymph node-positive disease. Our aggressive treatment of chemotherapy, wide surgical excision of PSM, and radiotherapy provided our patient with a 2-year disease-free status. CONCLUSION PSMs are a rare event in RARC, with only 4 other cases reported in published studies. The outcomes have not been well reported for these cases. We propose that multimodality treatment consisting of salvage chemotherapy, surgery, and radiotherapy should be considered, although concessions could be needed after consideration of patient factors.", "Flow diverter (FD) stents represent a new endovascular technique developed for the treatment of complex intracranial aneurysms (wide neck, fusiform, large, and giant aneurysms) that are challenging for classic endovascular techniques such as coiling, balloon-assisted coiling and stent-assisted coiling. Low porosity, high metal coverage, and high pore density are the main properties of FD stents. These properties induce hemodynamic changes redirecting the blood flow away from the aneurysm and into the parent artery leading to gradual thrombosis of the aneurysm. FD stents also provide scaffolding for subsequent neoendothelial proliferation, and vessel wall remodeling. This is considered as a paradigm shift compared to prior endovascular methods, which predominantly aimed at providing treatment inside the aneurysmal sac. This paper describes in detail the first released FD stent, the Silk flow-diverter stent (Balt Extrusion, Montmorency, France), its mechanism of action and deployment technique. It reviews the pertinent literature regarding safety, efficacy and potential risks and complications associated with the use of this stent.", " AND OBJECTIVES Recent studies have supported minimally invasive techniques as a viable alternative to open surgery in the treatment of gastric cancer. The goal of this study is to review our institution's experience with totally laparoscopic gastrectomy for the treatment of both early- and advanced-stage gastric cancer. METHODS A retrospective study was conducted to examine the short-term outcomes of laparoscopic gastrectomy performed at Monmouth Medical Center between May 2003 and June 2012. We reviewed postoperative complications, surgical margins, number of resected lymph nodes, estimated blood loss, length of stay, narcotic use, and recurrence rate. RESULTS Forty patients were included in the study. There were 21 cases of adenocarcinoma, 15 cases of gastrointestinal stromal tumor, 2 cases of carcinoid, 1 case of small cell neuroendocrine tumor, and 1 case of squamous cell carcinoma. The mean operative time was 220 minutes (range, 67- 450 minutes). The median length of stay was 6 days (range, 1-37 days). The mean number of harvested lymph nodes was 11. Early postoperative complications occurred in 7 patients and included anastomotic stricture, wound infection, intra-abdominal abscess, bowel obstruction, and esophageal pneumatosis. There were two deaths. The Kaplan-Meier 5-year overall and recurrence-free survival rate for all cases of adenocarcinoma was 63.2%. CONCLUSIONS Totally laparoscopic gastrectomy is a reasonable option for the treatment of gastric malignancy, with early data showing acceptable survival rates and perioperative outcomes. Large-scale randomized trials are still needed to confirm oncologic equivalency to open gastrectomy in patients with advanced disease.", " The management of acute thrombosis of inferior vena cava (AT-IVC) has evolved to catheter-based therapies, the results of which remain uncertain. We report our institution's experience treating AT-IVC using endovascular methods. METHODS A 10-year retrospective review of patients presenting with symptomatic IVC thrombosis between the years 2005 and 2014 was performed. Demographic data, treatment modalities, and outcomes were reviewed. RESULTS Twenty-five patients (44% men) underwent treatment for acute (<2 weeks) symptomatic IVC thrombosis. Presenting symptoms included pain and limb swelling in 23 (92%), motor dysfunction in 16 (64%), sensory loss in 14 (56%), and pulmonary embolism (PE) in 2 (8%) patients. Phlegmasia cerulea dolens was present in 5 patients, a history of malignancy was identified in 7 patients, and 21 patients had an IVC filter at presentation (Trapease 12, G2X 3, Option 2, Eclipse 2, Meridian 2). Four patients had a documented hypercoagulable state, 21 patients underwent venous angioplasty, and 7 (28%) patients underwent venous stenting of the IVC or iliofemoral veins. Significant (>50% luminal gain) angiographic resolution of venous thrombus was achieved in all 25 patients. Twenty-one (84%) patients reported moderate-to-complete symptomatic improvement immediately after completion of the procedures. Two patients had a clinically symptomatic PE and 1 patient underwent an above-knee amputation secondary to venous gangrene. Other complications included 6 minor bleeding complications (2 local hematoma, 4 hematuria) all of which resolved spontaneously. There were 2 major bleeding complications (1 disseminated intravascular coagulation, 1 retroperitoneal hematoma). CONCLUSIONS Endovascular treatment of AT-IVC, regardless of etiology, is safe and effective with excellent short-term clinical results. An aggressive endovascular approach to treatment of AT-IVC is warranted even in the presence of a thrombosed vena cava filter.", " AND PURPOSE The PED is a new endoluminal construct designed to exclude aneurysms from the parent cerebrovasculature. We report the very late (>1 year) thrombosis of PED constructs in 2 patients. RESULTS Two patients with very large fusiform basilar trunk aneurysms underwent parent artery reconstruction with the PED. Both patients were maintained on dual antiplatelet therapy throughout the first year following treatment. Follow-up conventional angiography, performed 12 months after treatment, demonstrated, in both patients, thrombosis of most of the aneurysm with minimal residual flow through the construct and into the aneurysm fundus. In response to the residual filling, clopidogrel was discontinued (aspirin therapy was maintained). Both patients presented with symptomatic acute occlusions of the PED constructs within 14 days of clopidogrel discontinuation. DISCUSSION Patient 1 presented with constitutional symptoms that progressed to severe headache without other neurologic signs or symptoms. Occlusion of the PED construct was confirmed with conventional angiography. MR imaging demonstrated no evidence of infarction or parenchymal injury. The headaches were managed successfully with steroid therapy. Patient 2 presented with a syndrome of acute basilar occlusion with brain stem stroke. Complete occlusion was confirmed on angiography. Emergent thrombolysis with mechanical revascularization was performed successfully; however, the patient ultimately succumbed to the infarction. CONCLUSIONS It appears that flow-diverting constructs built across large circumferential aneurysms may remain thrombogenic for much longer than conventional intracranial or peripheral bare metal stents. Constructs in these patients may remain susceptible to very late thrombosis, >1 year after implantation. These patients likely require long-term dual antiplatelet therapy (>1 year) to provide adequate prophylaxis against thrombosis. If these types of aneurysms demonstrate persistent residual filling months after PED reconstruction, operators should consider the placement of additional devices as an alternative to the discontinuation of 1 of the antiplatelet medications.", "Hysterectomy is the most common surgical gynecologic procedure, which is frequently related to the treatment of leiomyoma. The laparoscopic hysterectomy is associated with a shorter hospital stay, fewer infection rates, and a faster return to daily activities. Most gynecologists do not recommend a hysterectomy via the vagina or a laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH) in the case of a uterus weighing more than 300 g. This case report presents the case of an LAVH undertaken in a 43-year-old patient with a uterus weighing 2,800 g. There are no definite guidelines concerning the procedure for a large uterus, and the literature is vague regarding the best surgical procedure for these cases. The size of the uterus does not seem to be an absolute contraindication for endoscopic surgery. This procedure relies entirely on the surgeon's ability.", "OBJECTIVE To develop and validate a scoring tool capable of accurately predicting which patients with Barrett's esophagus (BE) will progress to dysplasia and/or esophageal adenocarcinoma.  Endoscopic therapies have emerged capable of eradicating BE with high efficacy and low complication rates, but which patients should receive treatment is still debated. Current knowledge of risk factors is insufficient to allow for the accurate prediction of which patients will progress to dysplasia or adenocarcinoma. METHODS We retrospectively collected data from a cohort of BE patients over a 13-year period. A multivariable logistic regression model was constructed to predict progression. A simplified risk of progression (ROP) score was developed from weighted beta coefficients. Internal validation was performed using bootstrap analysis, and model discrimination was assessed using k-fold cross-validation. RESULTS The cohort included 2591 BE patients of which 133 progressed to dysplasia/adenocarcinoma. Multivariable analysis with bootstrap internal validation resulted in 5 variables associated with an increased ROP (age \u226570 years, male sex, lack of proton-pump inhibitor use, segment greater than 3 cm, and history of esophageal candidiasis). Using this model, we developed a simple ROP score between 0 and 8. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed a cutoff of 3 or higher to have a sensitivity and specificity of 70% and 79%, respectively. Patients with a score of 3 or higher had an odds ratio of 9.04 (95% confidence interval 6.06-13.46). The c-statistic obtained from 10-fold cross-validation was 0.76 (95% confidence interval 0.72-0.79), indicating good overall discrimination. CONCLUSIONS Our data show the development and internal validation of the Barrett's Esophagus Assessment of Risk Score as capable of quantifying the likelihood of progression to dysplasia/adenocarcinoma. The Barrett's Esophagus Assessment of Risk Score can be used clinically to guide treatment decisions in nondysplastic BE patients.", "Covid-19 disease is caused by a novel SARS-CoV-2 virus and has been declared a pandemic on the 9th of March by WHO. Hallmark of COVID-19 management is supportive care and there is still no convincing evidence on a treatment which will reduce mortality. Severe COVID-19 associated sepsis characterized by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), secondary bacterial pneumonias thrombotic complications, myocarditis, and gastrointestinal involvement are more prevalent in those with comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiac disease, cancer and age>70 years (Liang et al; 2020, Guan et al; 2019).", "PURPOSE: Asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic infection with COVID-19 can result in silent transmission to large numbers of individuals, resulting in expansion of the pandemic with a global increase in morbidity and mortality. New ways of screening the general population for COVID-19 are urgently needed along with novel effective prevention and treatment strategies. HYPOTHESIS: A hypothetical three-part prevention, diagnostic, and treatment approach based on an up-to-date scientific literature review for COVID- 19 is proposed. Regarding diagnosis, a validated screening questionnaire and digital app for COVID-19 could help identify individuals who are at risk of transmitting the disease, as well as those at highest risk for poor clinical outcomes. Global implementation and online tracking of vital signs and scored questionnaires that are statistically validated would help health authorities properly allocate essential health care resources to test and isolate those at highest risk for transmission and poor outcomes. Second, regarding prevention, no validated protocols except for physical distancing, hand washing, and isolation exist, and recently ivermectin and the antimalarial drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine has been published to have anti-viral properties against COVID-19. A randomized trial of ivermectin or hydroxychloroquine alone, and/or nutraceuticals that have been published to support immune function including Vitamin C, zinc, and immunomodulatory supplements (3,6 Beta glucan) could be beneficial in preventing transmission or lessening symptomatology but requires statistical validation. Third, concerning treatment, COVID-19 induced inflammation and \u201ccytokine storm syndrome\u201d with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)/Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS) have resulted in extreme morbidity and mortality in those with certain comorbidities, secondary to \u201cacute respiratory distress syndrome\u201d (ARDS) and multiorgan dysfunction with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Deficiency in red blood cell, serum and alveolar glutathione has been published in the medical literature for ARDS, as well as viral and bacterial pneumonias, resulting from increased levels of free radical/oxidative stress. A randomized controlled trial of blocking NFKappa B and cytokine formation using glutathione precursors (N-acetyl-cysteine [NAC] and alpha lipoic acid) and PO/IV glutathione should be performed, along with an evaluation of Nrf2 activators (curcumin, sulforaphane glucosinolate) which have been scientifically proven to lower inflammation. Since high mortality rates from sepsis induced DIC due to COVID 19 infection has also been associated with thrombotic events and elevated levels of D-dimer, randomized controlled trials of using anticoagulant therapy with heparin is urgently required. This is especially important in patients on ventilators who have met certain sepsis induced coagulopathy (SIC) criteria. The use of acetazolamide with or without sildenafil also needs to be explored with or without heparin, since increased oxygen delivery to vital organs through prevention of thrombosis/pulmonary emboli along with carbonic anhydrase inhibition may help increase oxygenation and prevent adverse clinical outcomes. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: a three-part prevention, diagnostic, and treatment plan is proposed for addressing the severe complications of COVID-19. Digital monitoring of symptoms to clinically diagnose early exposure and response to treatment; prevention with hydroxychloroquine and/or ivermetin as well as nutritional therapies that support a healthy immune response; treatment with anti-inflammatory therapies that block NFKappaB and activate Nrf2 pathways, as well as novel therapies that address COVID-19 pneumonia and ARDS with DIC including anticoagulation and/ or novel respiratory therapies with or without acetazolamide and sildenafil. These three broad-based interventions urgently need to be subjected to randomized, controlled trials.", "UNLABELLED A response to Seiler et al: Interrupted or continuous slowly absorbable sutures for closure of primary elective midline abdominal incisions: a multicenter randomized trial (INSECT: ISRCTN24023541). Ann Surg 2009, 249(4):576-582.  Existing evidence suggests that the transfer of results of randomized controlled trials into clinical practice may be limited. Potential reasons can be attributed to aspects of external validity. The aim of this study is to investigate issues related to the external validity of the INSECT trial. METHODS All participating surgical departments were categorized and the clinical and baseline characteristics of randomized patients were evaluated. In addition, demographic and clinical data of all screened and randomized patients at the Departments of Surgery in Heidelberg and Erlangen were analyzed. RESULTS Twenty-five centers enrolled a total of 625 patients. These centers included eight primary, 11 secondary, and six tertiary care centers. The tertiary care centers enrolled the most patients (n = 237, 38%) followed by the primary care centers (n = 199, 32%) and the secondary care centers (n = 189 patients; 30%). The mean number and baseline data of randomized patients did not differ between the three types of care centers (p = 0.09). Overall, the treatment according to protocol was at least 92%. At the Department of Surgery, University of Heidelberg, 307 patients were screened and 60 out of 130 eligible patients were randomized. There were no differences in demographic and clinical baseline data between included and non-included patients. In Erlangen, 351 patients were screened and 57 out of 106 eligible patients randomized. CONCLUSIONS Results of the INSECT trial are applicable to a broad spectrum of patients treated at different hospital levels.", "The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is clinically characterized by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is responsible for a high number of patients needing mechanical ventilation or intensive care units treatment and for the elevated mortality risk. A link between COVID-19 and multiorgan failure may be dependent on the fact that most COVID-19 patients are complicated by pneumonia, which is known to be associated with early changes of clotting and platelet activation and artery dysfunction; these changes may implicate in thrombotic-related events such as myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke. Recent data showed that myocardial injury compatible with coronary ischemia may be detectable in SARS-CoV-2 patients and laboratory data exploring clotting system suggest the presence of a hypercoagulation state. Thus, we performed a systematic review of COVID-19 literature reporting measures of clotting activation to assess if changes are detectable in this setting and their relationship with clinical severity. Furthermore, we discussed the biologic plausibility of the thrombotic risk in SARS-CoV-2 and the potential use of an antithrombotic treatment.", "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a non-rheumatoid joint disease characterized by progressive degeneration of extra-cellular cartilage matrix (ECM), enhanced subchondral bone remodeling, osteophyte formation and synovial thickening. Alendronate (ALN) is a potent inhibitor of osteoclastic bone resorption and results in reduced bone remodeling. This study investigated the effects of pre-emptive use of ALN on OA related osteoclastic subchondral bone resorption in an in vivo rat model for severe OA. Using multi-modality imaging we measured effects of ALN treatment within cartilage and synovium. Severe osteoarthritis was induced in left rat knees using papain injections in combination with a moderate running protocol. Twenty rats were treated with subcutaneous ALN injections and compared to twenty untreated controls. Animals were longitudinally monitored for 12weeks with in vivo \u03bcCT to measure subchondral bone changes and SPECT/CT to determine synovial macrophage activation using a folate-based radiotracer. Articular cartilage was analyzed at 6 and 12weeks with ex vivo contrast enhanced \u03bcCT and histology to measure sulfated-glycosaminoglycan (sGAG) content and cartilage thickness. ALN treatment successfully inhibited subchondral bone remodeling. As a result we found less subchondral plate porosity and reduced osteophytosis. ALN treatment did not reduce subchondral sclerosis. However, after the OA induction phase, ALN treatment protected cartilage ECM from degradation and reduced synovial macrophage activation. Surprisingly, ALN treatment also improved sGAG content of tibia cartilage in healthy joints. Our data was consistent with the hypothesis that osteoclastic bone resorption might play an important role in OA and may be a driving force for progression of the disease. However, our study suggest that this effect might not solely be effects on osteoclastic activity, since ALN treatment also influenced macrophage functioning. Additionally, ALN treatment and physical activity exercised a positive effect in healthy control joints, which increased cartilage sGAG content. More research on this topic might lead to novel insights as to improve cartilage quality.", "Venous thromboembolic disease is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly in the setting of large volume pulmonary embolism. Thrombolytic therapy has been shown to be a successful treatment modality; however, its use somewhat limited due to the risk of hemorrhage and potential for distal embolization in the setting of large mobile thrombi. In patients where either thrombolysis is contraindicated or unsuccessful, and conventional therapies prove inadequate, surgical thrombectomy may be considered. We present a case of percutaneous endovascular extraction of a large mobile mass extending from the inferior vena cava into the right atrium using the Angiovac device, a venovenous bypass system designed for high-volume aspiration of undesired endovascular material. Standard endovascular methods for removal of cancer-associated thrombus, such as catheter-directed lysis, maceration, and exclusion, may prove inadequate in the setting of underlying tumor thrombus. Where conventional endovascular methods either fail or are unsuitable, endovascular thrombectomy with the Angiovac device may be a useful and safe minimally invasive alternative to open resection.", " Esophageal endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is an effective minimally invasive therapy for early esophageal cancer and high-grade Barrett dysplasia. However, esophageal stricture formation after circumferential or large ESD has limited its wide adoption. Mitomycin C (MMC), halofuginone (Hal), and transforming growth factor \u03b23 (TGF-\u03b23) exhibits antiscarring effects that may prevent post-ESD stricture formation. METHODS Using endoscopic mucosectomy (EEM) technique, an 8- to 10-cm-long circumferential esophageal mucosal segment was excised in a porcine model. The site was either untreated (control, n = 6) or received 40 evenly distributed injections of antiscarring agent immediately and at weeks 1 and 2. High and low doses were used: MMC 5 mg (n = 2), 0.5 mg (n = 2); Hal 5 mg (n = 2), 1.5 mg (n = 2), 0.5 mg (n = 2); TGF-\u03b23 2 \u03bcg (n = 2), 0.5 \u03bcg (n = 2). The degree of stricture formation was determined by the percentage reduction of the esophageal lumen on weekly fluoroscopic examination. Animals were euthanized when strictures exceeded 80 % or the animals were unable to maintain weight. RESULTS The control group had a luminal diameter reduction of 78.2 \u00b1 10.9 % by 2 weeks and were euthanized by week 3. Compared at 2 weeks, the Hal group showed a decrease in mean stricture formation (68.4 % low dose, 57.7 % high dose), while both TGF-\u03b23 dosage groups showed no significant change (65.3 % low dose, 76.2 % high dose). MMC was most effective in stricture prevention (53.6 % low dose, 35 % high dose). Of concern, the esophageal wall treated with high-dose MMC appeared to be necrotic and eventually led to perforation. In contrast, low dose MMC, TGF-\u03b23 and Hal treated areas appeared re-epithelialized and healthy. CONCLUSIONS Preliminary data on MMC and Hal demonstrated promise in reducing esophageal stricture formation after EEM. More animal data are needed to perform adequate statistical analysis in order to determine overall efficacy of antiscarring therapy.", " Uveitis is a common cause of blindness in feline patients as incorrectly treated or its chronicization can lead to formation of pre-iridal fibrovascular membranes, pupillary block and secondary glaucoma. The objective of this study was to investigate the causes of uveitis in cats diagnosed at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Bucharest between 2012 and 2015. Medical records were reviewed and cats were considered if complete diagnostic work-up, clinical examination and imaging studies were performed. All the feline cases were serologically tested for at least two of the common infectious causes: feline leukemia virus, feline immunodeficiency virus, feline coronavirus, Toxoplasma gondii, and Bartonella spp. Ninety-six cats with a mean age of 5.42 years, ranging from 1 month to 17 years old, with a male to female ratio of 1.33/1 were diagnosed with uveitis. The European domestic cat was overrepresented at 76% followed by Birman cat (6.3%), Persian cat (4.2%), Russian blue (4.2%), Norwegian cat (2%), British Short Hair (1%), Sphynx (1%) and Cornish Rex (1%). Infectious diseases were the cause of uveitis in 31 cases (32.3%), neoplasia was diagnosed in 22 cases (22.9%), uveitis secondary to septic keratitis in 8 cases (8.3%) and uveitis secondary to direct ocular trauma in 6 cases (6.3%). Twenty-nine cats (30.2%) with a mean age of 4.33 years old were diagnosed with idiopathic or immune-mediated uveitis, less than previously reported. Aqueous flare occurred in 91 cats and keratic precipitates were noted in 39 cats. The most common infectious cause of uveitis in this study was Toxoplasma gondii (n=18). Infectious diseases remain the most common cause of feline uveitis, therefore systemic evaluation and serological investigations should be performed in all cats with uveitis, cataract and glaucoma.", "OBJECTIVE The aim of the present analysis was to report on the relationship between long-term improvement in quality of life (QOL) and fecal incontinence (FI) severity and long-term reduction in FI episodes after sacral nerve stimulation (SNS) or sacral neuromodulation. METHODS Patients who met inclusion/exclusion criteria, and initially had more than 2 FI episodes per week, were offered SNS therapy. Patients with 50% or higher reduction in FI during a 2-week test period were implanted with a neurostimulator (InterStim; Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minn). Assessments were completed by patients at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months after implant, and annually thereafter. The present report includes data from the 4-year postimplant follow-up. RESULTS A total of 133 patients underwent test stimulation with a 90% success rate, and as a result, 120 (110 females) with a mean age of 60.5 years and a mean duration of FI of 6.8 years received long-term implantation. Of them, 78 patients completed all or part of the 4-year follow-up assessment. Fecal incontinence episodes decreased from a mean of 9.4 per week at baseline to 1.9 per week at 48 months (P < 0.001). The 4-year analyses showed that SNS had a positive and sustained impact on all 4 scales of the Fecal Incontinence Quality of Life questionnaire (P < 0.001), Fecal Incontinence Severity Index scores improved from a mean of 39.9 to 28 (P < 0.001), and self-rated bowel health scores improved from a mean of 3.5 to 6.9 (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Sacral nerve stimulation not only restores or improves continence in treated patients with chronic FI but also improves their quality of life and symptom severity.", " Anemia is a well-recognized risk factor for both bleeding and ischemic events after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). We sought to determine the impact of baseline anemia on dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) cessation patterns \u22642 years after PCI and the subsequent risk of clinical adverse events. METHODS AND RESULTS PARIS (Patterns of Non-Adherence to Dual Anti-Platelet Regimen in Stented Patients) was a prospective multicenter observational registry of PCI-treated patients (n=5018). Anemia was defined as baseline Hb (hemoglobin) <12 g/dL for men and <11 g/dL for women. DAPT cessation modes included physician-recommended discontinuation, temporary interruption (\u226414 days), and disruption due to bleeding or noncompliance. The primary end point was 2-year major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), a composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, or target vessel revascularization. We identified 824 (18%) anemic and 4194 (82%) nonanemic patients. Anemic patients were older and had a higher rate of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and prior PCI. DAPT interruption and disruption were significantly more common in anemic patients throughout 2 years after PCI, whereas physician-recommended discontinuation occurred more often in anemic patients during the first year after PCI and in nonanemic patients during the second year. The 2-year adjusted risks of MACE and Bleeding Academic Research Consortium 3 or 5 bleeding events were significantly higher in anemic patients. Compared with uninterrupted DAPT, disruption, but not interruption and physician-recommended discontinuation, was associated with a higher risk of myocardial infarction in nonanemic patients and a higher risk of both myocardial infarction and MACE in anemic patients. There was no significant interaction between anemia and risk of clinical outcomes associated with each DAPT cessation mode. CONCLUSIONS Baseline anemia was associated with a significantly higher adjusted risk of MACE and major bleeding. Physicians more frequently recommend DAPT discontinuation to anemic patients during the first year, and to nonanemic patients during the second year after PCI. DAPT disruption was associated with a higher risk of MACE outcomes.", " With its growing popularity and potential outcome, complete uniportal thoracoscopic (CUT) surgery has been used in the treatment of thoracic diseases. This study aimed to summarize a personal experience of CUT anatomic lung resection with systematic mediastinal lymphadenectomy (CUT-ALR-SML) for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and to evaluate the feasibility and safety of CUT-ALR-SML in our institute. MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 326 patients with NSCLC were chosen to undergo CUT-ALR-SML in our institute from August 2013 to July 2018. Data such as clinicopathologic characteristics and perioperative outcomes were reviewed in this article. RESULTS For the 326 cases of ALR, the specific procedures and the corresponding number of cases were as follows: segmentectomy, 90; lobectomy, 218; sleeve lobectomy, 9; ipsilateral lobe combined with segment resected synchronously (i-L+S), 6; and pneumonectomy, 3. A total of 31 cases required conversion to open surgery, and 4 cases were converted to multiportal thoracoscopic surgery. All patients underwent SML. The average mediastinal lymph node stations and mediastinal lymph nodes dissected under CUT-ALR-SML were 3.3\u00b11.4 and 9.6\u00b18.4, respectively. Approximately 99.7% of the patients acquired free resection margins. A total of 42 (12.9%) patients suffered from postoperative complications, and 1 patient died of pneumonia during the perioperative period. CONCLUSIONS Complete uniportal ALR, particularly for segmentectomy and lobectomy is safe and feasible with low complication rates and excellent free resection margin rates. SML during complete uniportal thoracoscopic surgery adequately assesses the N2 lymph node. However, further studies need to be conducted to evaluate the role of CUT-ALR-SML in the treatment of NSCLC.", "Current anti-VEGF therapies for colorectal cancer (CRC) provide limited survival benefit, as tumors rapidly develop resistance to these agents. Here, we have uncovered an immunosuppressive role for nonclassical Ly6Clo monocytes that mediates resistance to anti-VEGFR2 treatment. We found that the chemokine CX3CL1 was upregulated in both human and murine tumors following VEGF signaling blockade, resulting in recruitment of CX3CR1+Ly6Clo monocytes into the tumor. We also found that treatment with VEGFA reduced expression of CX3CL1 in endothelial cells in vitro. Intravital microscopy revealed that CX3CR1 is critical for Ly6Clo monocyte transmigration across the endothelium in murine CRC tumors. Moreover, Ly6Clo monocytes recruit Ly6G+ neutrophils via CXCL5 and produce IL-10, which inhibits adaptive immunity. Preventing Ly6Clo monocyte or Ly6G+ neutrophil infiltration into tumors enhanced inhibition of tumor growth with anti-VEGFR2 therapy. Furthermore, a gene therapy using a nanoparticle formulated with an siRNA against CX3CL1 reduced Ly6Clo monocyte recruitment and improved outcome of anti-VEGFR2 therapy in mouse CRCs. Our study unveils an immunosuppressive function of Ly6Clo monocytes that, to our knowledge, has yet to be reported in any context. We also reveal molecular mechanisms underlying antiangiogenic treatment resistance, suggesting potential immunomodulatory strategies to enhance the long-term clinical outcome of anti-VEGF therapies.", " We describe the implementation of minimal sufficient balance randomization, a covariate-adaptive randomization technique, used for the \"Endovascular treatment for Small Core and Anterior circulation Proximal occlusion with Emphasis on minimizing CT to recanalization times\" (ESCAPE) trial. METHODS The ESCAPE trial is a prospective, multicenter, randomized clinical trial that enrolled subjects with the following main inclusion criteria: less than 12 h from symptom onset, age 18 years or older, baseline NIHSS score > 5, ASPECTS score > 5 and computed tomography angiography (CTA) evidence of carotid T/L or M1-segment middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion, and at least moderate collaterals by CTA. Patients were randomized using a real-time, dynamic, Internet-based, minimal sufficient balance randomization method that balanced the study arms with respect to baseline covariates including age, sex, baseline NIHSS score, site of arterial occlusion, baseline ASPECTS score and treatment with intravenously administered alteplase. RESULTS Permutation-based tests of group differences confirmed group balance across several baseline covariates including sex (p = 1.00), baseline NIHSS score (p = 0.95), site of arterial occlusion (p = 1.00), baseline ASPECTS score (p = 0.28), treatment with intravenously administered alteplase (p = 0.31), and age (p = 0.67). CONCLUSION Results from the ESCAPE trial demonstrate the feasibility and the benefit of this covariate adaptive randomization scheme in small-sample trials and for data monitoring endeavors. TRIAL REGISTRATION ESCAPE trial - NCT01778335 - at www.clinicaltrials.gov . Registered on 29 January 2013.", " Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is an established treatment in patients with heart failure and prolonged QRS duration where a biventricular pacemaker is implanted to achieve faster activation and more synchronous contraction of the left ventricle (LV). Despite the convincing effect of CRT, 30-40% of patients do not respond. Among the most important correctable causes of non-response to CRT is non-optimal LV lead position. METHODS We will enroll 122 patients in this patient-blinded and assessor-blinded, randomized, clinical trial aiming to investigate if implanting the LV lead guided by electrical mapping towards the latest LV activation as compared with imaging-guided implantation, causes an excess increase in left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (LVEF). The patients are randomly assigned to either the intervention group: preceded by cardiac computed tomography of the cardiac venous anatomy, the LV lead is placed according to the latest LV activation in the coronary sinus (CS) branches identified by systematic electrical mapping of the CS at implantation and post-implant optimization of the interventricular pacing delay; or patients are assigned to the control group: placement of the LV lead guided by cardiac imaging. The LV lead is targeted towards the latest mechanical LV activation as identified by echocardiography and outside myocardial scar as identified by myocardial perfusion (MP) imaging. The primary endpoint is change in LVEF at 6-month follow up (6MFU) as compared with baseline measured by two-dimensional echocardiography. Secondary endpoints include relative percentage reduction in LV end-systolic volume, all-cause mortality, hospitalization for heart failure, and a clinical combined endpoint of response to CRT at 6MFU defined as the patient being alive, not hospitalized for heart failure, and experiencing improvement in NYHA functional class or/and > 10% increase in 6-minute walk test. DISCUSSION We assume an absolute increase in LVEF of 12% in the intervention group versus 8% in the control group. If an excess increase in LVEF can be achieved by LV lead implantation guided by electrical mapping, this study supports the conduct of larger trials investigating the impact of this strategy for LV-lead implantation on clinical outcomes in patients treated with CRT.

Patients were enrolled between 16 February 2015 and 13 December 2017.", " Endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms can be technically difficult when the neck is wide. The Solitaire AB stent (Covidien, Irvine, California), the only fully retrieved stent, assists in the coiling of wide-neck intracranial aneurysms. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the mid-term angiographic follow-up of wide-necked aneurysms treated with the Solitaire AB stent. METHODS SOLARE (SOLitaire Aneurysm Remodeling) is a consecutive, prospective study conducted in 7 European centers. A core laboratory evaluated the postoperative and mid-term (6 month \u00b1 15 days) angiographic results by using the Raymond classification Scale. Recanalization was defined as worsening, and progressive thrombosis was defined as improvement in the Raymond scale score. RESULTS The mean width of the aneurysm sac was 7.5 mm, and the mean diameter of the aneurysm neck was 4.7 mm. Angiographic mid-term follow-up was obtained in 55 of 65 aneurysms (85.9%). Complete occlusion was achieved in 33 aneurysms (60%); a neck remnant was seen in 16 aneurysms (29.1%) and an aneurysm remnant in 6 aneurysms (10.9%). Of 55 aneurysms, recanalization was observed in 8 aneurysms (14.5%), and progressive thrombosis was observed in 17 aneurysms (30.9%). No bleeding or rebleeding was observed during the follow-up period. CONCLUSION Stent-assisted coiling of wide-necked intracranial aneurysms was found to be safe and effective with the Solitaire AB stent at 6-month follow-up. Angiographic results improve with time due to progressive thrombosis of the aneurysm.", "Between March 10, 2020 and April 17, 2020, of 8/70 (11.4%) SARS-CoV-2 positive infants that presented, 5/8 (63%) developed fever, 4/8 (50%) had lower respiratory tract involvement, 2/8 (25%) had neutropenia and thrombocytosis, and 4/8 infants (50%) were treated for suspected sepsis with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Only 1/8 (13%) required pediatric intensive care. All patients were eventually discharged home well.", "Pancreatico-gastric anastomotic insufficiency successfully treated with endoscopic vacuum therapy.", "Perioperative management of patients treated with the non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants is an ongoing challenge. Due to the lack of good clinical studies involving adequate monitoring and reversal therapies, management requires knowledge and understanding of pharmacokinetics, renal function, drug interactions, and evaluation of the surgical bleeding risk. Consideration of the benefit of reversal of anticoagulation is important and, for some low risk bleeding procedures, it may be in the patient's interest to continue anticoagulation. In case of major intra-operative bleeding in patients likely to have therapeutic or supra-therapeutic levels of anticoagulation, specific reversal agents/antidotes would be of value but are currently lacking. As a consequence, a multimodal approach should be taken which includes the administration of 25 to 50 U/kg 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrates or 30 to 50 U/kg activated prothrombin complex concentrate (FEIBA\u00ae) in some life-threatening situations. Finally, further studies are needed to clarify the ideal therapeutic intervention.", "Interferons (IFNs) are generally considered antiviral cytokines, yet the newly discovered IFN-\u03bb4 is linked with the failure to clear hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection either spontaneously or in response to treatment. IFN-\u03bb4 can be generated only by individuals who carry the IFNL4-\u0394G allele (rs368234815), which is the strongest known host factor for predicting clearance of HCV. The ancestral IFNL4-\u0394G allele is the major variant in Africans while the minor variant in Asians, suggesting very strong negative genetic selection for this allele-most likely driven by an infectious agent other than HCV. IFN-\u03bb4 most closely resembles IFN-\u03bb3, but these proteins share only 29% amino-acid identity, and, in contrast to IFN-\u03bb3, IFN-\u03bb4 is only weakly secreted. Nevertheless, IFN-\u03bb4 signals through the IFN-\u03bb receptor complex and induces expression of IFN-stimulated genes via the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription signaling pathway. Although the IFNL4-\u0394G variant is strongly associated with the failure to clear HCV infection, HCV-infected patients who carry this allele have lower baseline HCV RNA levels in the absence of treatment. Resolving the paradoxical functions of IFN-\u03bb4, which appears to induce antiviral activity yet impair effective clearance of HCV, may yield critical new insights into the immunologic response to HCV infection and IFN biology.", "OBJECTIVE The objectives of this study were to evaluate the need for inferior vena cava (IVC) filters and to identify anatomic and patient-specific risk factors associated with embolization in patients undergoing thrombolysis for acute iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis (DVT). METHODS Consecutive patients who underwent catheter-directed thrombolysis or pharmacomechanical thrombolysis (PMT) for iliofemoral DVT from May 2007 to March 2012 were identified from a prospectively maintained database. Patients were categorized in two groups, depending on the status of IVC filtration during the lysis procedures: patients with an IVC filter protection (group A) and patients without an IVC filter protection (group B). The primary outcome was perioperative clinically significant pulmonary embolism (PE) or intraprocedural IVC filter clot capture. RESULTS Eighty patients (mean age, 50 \u00b1 16 years; 39 women) with symptoms averaging 12 \u00b1 10 days were treated. A perioperative IVC filter was placed in 32 patients, and nine patients had an indwelling patent filter (group A, n = 41). Twenty patients received no filter, and 19 patients had an indwelling thrombosed filter (group B, n = 39). There were no clinically significant PE in either group. In group A, nine patients (22%) had documented embolic clot within the filter nest. The clot volume was deemed clinically significant in only two patients (5%). Factors related to embolization included female gender (odds ratio [OR], 5.833; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.038-32.797; P = .032) and preoperative clinical PE (OR, 5.6; 95% CI, 1.043-30.081; P = .054). A trend for increased embolization was seen with a higher average number of DVT risk factors (1.44 vs 1; P = .065) and when PMT was used as a single treatment (OR, 4.32; 95% CI, 0.851-21.929; P = .087). CONCLUSIONS IVC filters during thrombolysis should be used selectively in patients with preoperative clinical PE, in women and potentially in patients with multiple risk factors for DVT, or when stand-alone PMT is planned.", "Case 1, a man in his 70s, was admitted because of a bleeding gastric ulcer during DCF therapy for esophageal cancer(EC). Three days after endoscopic hemostasis, abdominal pain and vomiting occurred.CT revealed hepatic portal venous gas (HPVG).No intestinal necrosis was observed on contrast-enhanced CT.Therefore, we selected a conservative treatment and found improvement.Case 2, a man in his 70s, developed frequent diarrhea during DCF therapy for EC.Case 3, a man in his 80s, developed hematochezie during DCF therapy for EC.Both cases 2 and 3 were diagnosed as HPVG using abdominal ultrasonography.The symptoms were mild, so we selected a conservative treatment and found improvement.Case 4, a man in his 60s, noticed sudden severe abdominal pain during DGS therapy for EC.Plain CT detected HPVG and gas in the small intestinal wall.We suspected intestinal necrosis due to HPVG with peritoneal irritation and performed emergency small intestine resection.We encountered 4 patients who developed HPVG during chemotherapy.The presence of HPVG is a poor prognostic sign, suggestive of intestinal necrosis, but some patients show improvement with conservative treatments.We also discuss previous reviews and reports.", "OBJECTIVE To describe the incidence of patient-ventilator asynchrony and different types of asynchrony in preterm infants treated with non-synchronised nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (nIPPV). DESIGN An observational study was conducted including preterm infants born with a gestational age (GA) less than 32 weeks treated with non-synchronised nIPPV. During 1 hour, spontaneous breathing was measured with transcutaneous electromyography of the diaphragm simultaneous with ventilator inflations. An asynchrony index (AI), a percentage of asynchronous breaths, was calculated and the incidence of different types of inspiratory and expiratory asynchrony were reported. RESULTS Twenty-one preterm infants with a mean GA of 26.0\u00b11.2 weeks were included in the study. The mean inspiratory AI was 68.3%\u00b14.7% and the mean expiratory AI was 67.1%\u00b17.3%. Out of 5044 comparisons of spontaneous inspirations and mechanical inflations, 45.3% of the mechanical inflations occurred late, 23.3% of the mechanical inflations were early and 31.4% of the mechanical inflation were synchronous. 40.3% of 5127 expiratory comparisons showed an early termination of ventilator inflations, 26.7% of the mechanical inflations terminated late and 33.0% mechanical inflations terminated in synchrony with a spontaneous expiration. In addition, 1380 spontaneous breaths were unsupported and 611 extra mechanical inflations were delivered. CONCLUSION Non-synchronised nIPPV results in high patient-ventilator asynchrony in preterm infants during both the inspiratory and expiratory phase of the breathing cycle. New synchronisation techniques are urgently needed and should address both inspiratory and expiratory asynchrony.", " Laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy (LADG) with standard D2 dissection is a complex procedure usually performed only by experienced surgeons, and the feasibility of this procedure still remains unclear. METHOD Patients who underwent LADG at the Cancer Institute Hospital between April 2006 and October 2008 were recruited for this study. Early surgical outcomes were compared between patients who underwent complete D2 dissection (complete D2 group; n = 42) and those who underwent D1 + beta dissection (D1 + beta group; n = 179) to determine the feasibility of laparoscopic D2 lymph node dissection. RESULTS In complete D2 group, the operation time was longer (253 +/- 10 vs 224 +/- 4 min; P = 0.005), and the number of retrieved lymph nodes was larger (41 +/- 2 vs 35 +/- 1; P = 0.002) compared with those in D1 + beta group. The other early surgical outcomes monitored for the two groups were not different between groups. CONCLUSIONS LADG with complete D2 lymph node dissection can be performed safely if the procedure is standardized and an experienced laparoscopic surgeon performs the surgery. To be accepted as a standard treatment for advanced gastric cancer, well-designed prospective trial is necessary.", "PURPOSE A single surgeon skilled in conventional laparoscopic surgery used laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) to treat benign urological diseases. This study reports our surgical results and introduces a simple technique with tips based on our experience. MATERIALS AND METHODS LESS surgery was performed on 116 patients by use of a homemade single-port device composed of an Alexis wound retractor and a powder-free surgical glove. Cases were 44 varicocelectomies (including 8 bilateral cases), 38 renal cyst marsupializations (including 3 bilateral cases), 26 ureterolithotomies (with 1 concomitant ureterolithotomy and contralateral renal cyst marsupialization), 4 prostatic enucleations, and 4 bladder rupture repairs. The mean patient age was 44.43\u00b116.46 years (range, 11 to 76 years), and the male-to-female ratio was 87:29. RESULTS In one ureterolithotomy case, LESS was converted to conventional laparoscopic surgery. The mean operative time was 87.03\u00b145.03 minutes, the estimated blood loss was 61.90 ml (range, 0 to 2,000 ml), and the mean hospital stay was 3.03\u00b12.12 days. Two patients underwent single-port transvesical enucleation of the prostate (STEP) requiring patient-controlled anesthesia. No patients developed major complications, and all patients were satisfied, with 75.86% expressing a high degree of satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS We report successful treatment outcomes for LESS in 116 cases of benign urological disease. Our findings suggest that LESS can replace conventional laparoscopy.", " To analyze survival, neurologic injury, and kidney function after acute type A aortic dissection. METHODS A total of 445 patients undergoing surgery for acute type A aortic dissection were analyzed. Evaluation according to risk factors for mortality, neurologic injury, and kidney function was performed. RESULTS Overall 1-, 5-, and 10-year survival rates were 82.8 \u00b1 1.8%, 73.6 \u00b1 2.4%, and 59.3 \u00b1 3.9, respectively. Independent preoperative risk factors for mortality were preexisting renal impairment (p = 0.001), reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (p < 0.001), and age (p < 0.001). Perioperative risk factors were prolonged cross-clamp (p < 0.001) and cerebral perfusion time (p = 0.001). Risk factors for renal failure were preexisting renal impairment (p < 0.001), prolonged cross-clamp time (p < 0.001), cerebral perfusion time (p < 0.001), and age (p = 0.022). Risk factors for neurologic injury were cross-clamp time (p = 0.038), cerebral perfusion time (p = 0.007), and age (p = 0.045). CONCLUSION In addition to classic risk factors, survival after type A aortic dissection is affected by preexisting renal impairment. Preexisting renal impairment is predictive of postoperative renal failure. Therefore treatment and prevention strategies for renal failure during the acute and long-term course after acute type A aortic dissection are warranted.", "Endovascular mechanical thrombectomy (MT) is reserved for acute ischaemic stroke secondary to large vessel occlusion. The various MT techniques employed in the treatment of hyperacute strokes are constantly evolving with new devices and improvisation of existing technology (Wahlgren, et al 2016). In this review, we describe a variety of MT techniques gained from our experience of performing over 350 procedures in 7 years of providing a 24/7 service within the national framework of a hyperacute stroke centre. We outline a number of endovascular techniques, procedure limitations, and potential complications.", "COVID-19 has created enormous challenges for health systems worldwide, with the rapidly growing number of deaths and critical patients with pneumonia requiring ventilatory support. Alternative methods to control the spread of the disease such as social isolation, extreme quarantine measures, and contact tracing have been used around the world. However, these measures may not be totally effective to fight COVID-19, in step with the necessary national preparations to meet the new patient care demands. A wide range of digital technologies can be used to enhance these public health strategies, and the pandemic has sparked increasing use of telehealth. This field has grown considerably in Brazil in recent years. Still, despite the intense proliferation of recommendations and rules, until the current pandemic the country still lacked a fully consolidated regulatory framework. The emergence of COVID-19 marks a key moment in the expansion of applications and use of telehealth for improving the health system's response to the current crisis. The article discusses telehealth's contribution to the fight against COVID-19 and the recent initiatives triggered in Brazil as opportunities for the consolidation of telemedicine and improvement of the Brazilian Unified National Health System. The authors conclude that telehealth offers capabilities for remote screening, care and treatment, and assists monitoring, surveillance, detection, prevention, and mitigation of the impacts on healthcare indirectly related to COVID-19. The initiatives triggered in this process can reshape the future space of telemedicine in health services in the territory.", " Comparable oncological outcomes have been seen after surgical nephrectomy and thermal ablation of renal tumors recently. However, periprocedural outcome needs to be assessed for aiding treatment decision. PURPOSE To compare efficacy rates and periprocedural outcome (technical success, session time, hospitalization time, and complications) after renal tumor treatment with laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (LPN) or radiofrequency ablation (RFA). MATERIAL AND METHODS The initial experience with 49 (treated with LPN) and 84 (treated with RFA) consecutive patients for a single renal tumor (diameter \u2264 5 cm, limited to the kidney) during 2007-2014 was evaluated. Patient and tumor characteristics, efficacy rates, and periprocedural outcome were collected retrospectively. The stratified Mantel Haenzel and Van Elteren tests, adjusted for tumor complexity (with the modified R.E.N.A.L nephrometry score [m-RNS]), were used to assess differences in treatment outcomes. RESULTS Primary efficacy rate was 98% for LPN and 85.7% for RFA; secondary efficacy rate was 93.9% for LPN and 95.2% for RFA; and technical success rate was 87.8% for LPN and 100% for RFA. Median session (m-RNS adjusted P < 0.001; LPN 215 min, RFA 137 min) and median hospitalization time were longer after LPN (m-RNS adjusted P < 0.001; LPN 5 days, RFA 2 days). Side effects were uncommon (LPN 2%, RFA 4.8%). Complications were more frequent after LPN (m-RNS adjusted P < 0.001; LPN 42.9%, RFA 10.7%). CONCLUSION Both methods achieved equivalent secondary efficacy rates. RFA included several treatment sessions, but session and hospitalization times were shorter, and complications were less frequent than for LPN. The differences remained after adjustment for renal tumor complexity.", "Purpose The mechanism by which bariatric surgery facilitates diabetic control is still unknown. Duodenojejunal bypass supports the foregut theory; however, its efficacy when used alone is not yet established. Methods During the period from January 2008 to December 2009, patients who underwent laparoscopic duodenojejunal bypass (LDJB) or laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with or without morbid obesity were included. Patients who had a follow-up for less than 3 years were excluded. Patient baseline characteristics, change of body weight, body mass index (BMI), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and diabetic treatments were analyzed. Results In total, 8 LDJB and 20 LRYGB patients were analyzed. The LDJB group had more number of male patients than the LRYGB group (LDJB 75% vs. LRYGB 30%, P = 0.030). Baseline BMI in the LRYGB group was higher than in the LDJB group (LDJB 27.0 \u00b1 2.5 vs. LRYGB 32.6 \u00b1 3.4, P < 0.001). Age, DM duration, baseline HbA1c, and C-peptide levels were similar. Longer operation time was needed to perform LDJB (LDJB 367.5 \u00b1 120.2 vs. LRYGB 232.9 \u00b1 41.1, P < 0.001), but no differences were observed in the hospital stay and complication rate between the 2 groups. At the third year of follow-up, the T2DM remission rate was observed in 40% of patients in the LRYGB group and 12.5% of patients in the LDJB group. Conclusion LDJB is not an effective method for controlling T2DM compared with LRYGB. Foregut theory may not be the main mechanism of diabetic control during bariatric surgery.", "PURPOSE The purpose of the study was to evaluate feasibility of pharmacomechanical thrombectomy (PMT) in the treatment of Paget-Schroetter syndrome (PSS) followed by thoracoscopic or open surgical decompression of the subclavian vein. METHODS Twenty-two out of 27 consecutive patients with PSS received PMT using the Trellis-8 peripheral infusion system (Covidien) between 2010 and 2014. Subsequent surgery was performed in 18 of those patients, 9 patients were treated with thoracoscopic, 7 patients with subclavicular, and 2 patients with transaxillary first rib resection, 4 patients were treated with PMT and anticoagulation alone. Technical success, complications, and patency were registered. RESULTS PMT was successful in 21 (95 %) patients; 1 patient with unsatisfactory lysis received further catheter-directed thrombolysis, which, however, did not improve the result. The mean endovascular procedure time was 105 \u00b1 33 min (range 70-200 min), and the required median amount of thrombolytic agent was 500,000 international unit (IU; range 250,000-1,000,000 IU). Adjunctive balloon venoplasty and aspiration were used in 18 (82 %) and 7 (32 %) cases, respectively. One patient had an intimal tear of the subclavian vein that was discovered and repaired during surgery. There were no other complications related to the endovascular procedure. At follow-up, 18 of 21 patients (86 %) with follow-up imaging available had patent subclavian vein, and all except 1 of the 22 patients were asymptomatic. The mean follow-up time was 25 \u00b1 17 months. CONCLUSIONS In experienced hands, PMT is effective for early thrombus removal in PSS. Surgical decompression must be considered after PMT.", " Brain arteriovenous malformation (BAVM) is a rare pathology diagnosed mostly in young adults. However, due to its hemorrhagic complications, it constitutes an important clinical problem. Treatment modalities available include endovascular, surgery and radiosurgery. The aim of the study was to assess the efficacy and safety of endovascular treatment of BAVM with Onyx\u00ae by reporting one-center experience. MATERIAL AND METHODS Between 2006 and 2013, 54 patients with BAVM were embolized with Onyx. The group consisted of 24 males and 30 females, aged 10 to 65 years (mean 42.6\u00b115.4). Clinical manifestations of BAVMs were: hemorrhage in 27 (50.0%), headaches in 12 (22.2%), seizures in 7 (13.0%) and focal neurologic deficits in 2 (3.7%) patients. Six (11.1%) patients were asymptomatic. A majority of BAVMs were of II and III grade in Spetzler-Martin scale (19 and 22 cases respectively). RESULTS A total number of 108 endovascular procedures were performed (mean 2.00\u00b10.98 sessions/patient). Complete obliteration of malformation was achieved in 25 (46.3%) patients, mostly with grade II and III BAVMs. In 29 (53.7%) patients, embolization led to a decrease in size of BAVM that made it feasible for other treatment modality. Morbidity and mortality rates were 5.6% and 1.8% respectively. The rate of hemorrhagic complications was 9.3%. CONCLUSION Embolization of BAVM with Onyx\u00ae is an effective and safe method of treatment. However, regarding type and consequences of complications, the technique needs further improvement.", " A delta-shaped anastomosis in totally laparoscopic Billroth I gastrectomy could be performed easily and sufficiently using only laparoscopic linear staplers. However, the restricted maneuverability and severe blurring of these staplers along with their limited hemostability induced strain. In this study, we determined the feasibility and safety of performing delta-shaped anastomosis using the Endo GIA\u2122 Reloads with Tri-Staple\u2122 Technology combined with Endo GIA\u2122 Ultra Universal stapler (Tri-Staple) with a particular focus on short-term surgical outcomes. METHODS We performed a single-institutional prospective interventional study (UMIN 000008014). The Tri-Staple was prospectively used on 23 consecutive patients who underwent a curative totally laparoscopic Billroth I gastrectomy with delta-shaped anastomosis. These patients were matched with the 19 patients previously treated using the ENDOPATH(\u00ae) ETS Articulating Linear Cutters (ETS) on clinical and demographic characteristics. RESULTS There were no differences between the groups in anastomosis-related local complications, morbidity, non-anastomosis-related local complications, total systemic complications, and short-term outcomes with the exception of significantly reduced blood loss in the Tri-Staple group (ETS vs. Tri-Staple: 37 [10-306] vs. 15 [5-210] mL, p = 0.02). Intraoperative bleeding from the staple line was significantly reduced in the Tri-Staple group. The postoperative drain indwelling period (ETS vs. Tri-Staple, 6 [4-10] vs. 4 [2-43] days, p = 0.032), fasting period (5 [3-7] vs. 3 [3-24] days, p = 0.022), and hospital stay (14 [10-47] vs. 11 [6-58] days, p = 0.025) were significantly shorter in the Tri-Staple group. There was no mortality in this series. Acceleration assessed as indices of blurring of stapler tip might have a significant adverse influence on staple-line bleeding at stapling sites. CONCLUSION Totally laparoscopic Billroth I distal gastrectomy using Tri-Staple was feasible and safe with favorable short-term surgical outcomes. Reduced blurring while stapling may be a novel endpoint which newly developed stapling devices should target.", " AND PURPOSE The Low-Profile Visualized Intraluminal Support (LVIS) stent is a new device recently introduced for the treatment of wide-neck intracranial aneurysms. This single-center study presents the authors' preliminary experience using the LVIS stent to treat saccular aneurysms with parent arteries smaller than 2.5 mm. MATERIALS AND METHODS Aneurysms with a LVIS stent used in a small parent vessel (<2.5 mm in diameter) between October 2014 and April 2016 were included. Procedure-related complications, angiographic results, clinical outcomes, and midterm follow-up data were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS A total of 22 patients was studied, including 5 ruptured and 17 unruptured aneurysms. Most of the aneurysms were located in the anterior circulation (90.9%). Stent placement in the parent arteries measuring 1.7-2.4 mm in diameter (mean, 2.1 mm) was successful in 100% of cases. Procedure-related complication developed in 1 patient (4.5%) who presented with aneurysm rupture. No permanent morbidity and mortality occurred. Immediate angiographic outcome showed complete occlusion in 8 aneurysms (36.4%), neck residual in 8 (36.4%), and residual aneurysm in 6 (27.3%). All patients underwent angiographic follow-up at a mean of 8.3 months, which revealed complete occlusion in 18 (81.8%) patients, neck remnant in 3 (13.6%), and residual sac in 1 (4.5%). No recanalization of the target aneurysm was observed. There was 1 case with asymptomatic in-stent stenosis. CONCLUSIONS Our preliminary results show that the deployment of LVIS stents in small vessels is feasible, safe, and effective in the midterm. Larger studies with long-term follow-up are needed to validate our promising results.", "Central venous catheter-related blood stream infections (CR-BSIs) are a serious complication in patients with hematological malignancies. However, it remains unclear whether there is a difference in the rate of CR-BSI associated with the conventional type of central venous catheters (cCVCs) and peripherally inserted CVCs (PICCs) in such patients. To address this question, we retrospectively investigated the incidence of CR-BSIs associated with PICCs versus cCVCs in patients with hematological malignancies. We used PICCs in all consecutive patients requiring CVC placement between February 2009 and February 2013. We compared the CR-BSI rate in patients with PICCs with that in patients with cCVCs treated between September 2006 and January 2009 (control group). Eighty-four patients received PICCs and 85 received cCVCs. The most common reason for removal due to catheter-related complications was CR-BSI. The CR-BSI rate in the PICC group was significantly lower than that in the cCVC group (PICCs: 1.23/1000 catheter days; cCVCs: 5.30/1000 catheter days; P < 0.01). Catheter-related complications other than CR-BSIs occurred at an extremely low rate in the PICC group. The median catheter-related complication-free survival duration was significantly longer in the PICC group than in the cCVC group. Our study shows that PICCs are useful in patients with hematological malignancies.", "Pancreatico-gastric anastomotic insufficiency successfully treated with endoscopic vacuum therapy.", "Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute self-limiting systemic vasculitis of unknown aetiology. It is the most common cause of acquired heart disease in young children. The intense inflammatory process has a predilection for the coronary arteries, resulting in the development of aneurysmal lesions, arterial thrombotic occlusion or, potentially, sudden death. There is no specific diagnostic test; however, treatment with immunoglobulin and aspirin effectively reduces cardiac complications from 25% to 4.7% in the UK. Inflammation of the myocardium, endocardium or pericardium can occur early in the disease and endothelial dysfunction along with abnormalities of myocardial blood flow may require continuing medication, interventional catheterisation or even cardiac surgery. Several new pharmacological treatments may have important roles to play in managing KD in children and adolescents. This review discusses the history of the disease, the diagnostic challenges, epidemiology, aetiology, pathology, immunopathogenesis, treatment, genetic influences and the long-term cardiovascular sequelae.", "Patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE) are prone to the development of both short-term and long-term complications that can substantially affect their functional capacity and quality of life. Patients with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) often develop recurrent VTE or the post-thrombotic syndrome, whereas patients with pulmonary embolism (PE) can develop long-term symptoms and functional limitations along a broad spectrum extending to full-blown chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. Clinicians who care for patients showing severe clinical manifestations of DVT and PE are often faced with challenging decisions concerning whether and how to escalate to more aggressive treatments such as those involving the use of thrombolytic drugs. The purpose of this chapter is to provide guidance on how best to individualize care to these patients.", " AND PURPOSE Flow-diverter stents are widely used for the treatment of wide-neck intracranial aneurysms. Various parameters may influence intracranial aneurysm thrombosis, including the flow reduction induced by flow-diverter stent implantation, which is assumed to play a leading role. However, its actual impact remains unclear due to the lack of detailed intra-aneurysmal flow measurements. This study aimed to clarify this relationship by quantitatively measuring the intra-aneurysmal flow using 4D phase-contrast MR imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS We acquired prospective pre- and post-stent implantation 4D phase-contrast MR imaging data of a consecutive series of 23 patients treated with flow-diverter stents. Velocity field data were combined with the intraprocedural 3D angiogram vessel geometries for precise intracranial aneurysm extraction and partial volume correction. Intra-aneurysmal hemodynamic modifications were compared with occlusion outcomes at 6 and 12 months. RESULTS The averaged velocities at systole were lower after flow-diverter stent implantation for all patients and ranged from 21.7 \u00b1 7.1 cm/s before to 7.2 \u00b1 2.9 cm/s after stent placement. The velocity reduction was more important for the group of patients with aneurysm thrombosis at 6 months (68.8%) and decreased gradually from 66.2% to 55% for 12-month thrombosis and no thrombosis, respectively (P = .08). CONCLUSIONS We propose an innovative approach to measure intracranial flow changes after flow-diverter stent implantation. We identified a trend between flow reduction and thrombosis outcome that brings a new insight into current understanding of the flow-diversion treatment response.", "In the beta-cells of pancreatic islets, insulin is stored as the predominant protein within storage granules that undergo regulated exocytosis in response to glucose. By pulse-chase analysis of radiolabeled protein condensation in beta-cells, the formation of insoluble aggregates of regulated secretory protein lags behind the conversion of proinsulin to insulin. Condensation occurs within immature granules (IGs), accounting for passive protein sorting as demonstrated by constitutive-like secretion of newly synthesized C- peptide in stoichiometric excess of insulin (Kuliawat, R., and P. Arvan. J. Cell Biol. 1992. 118:521-529). Experimental manipulation of condensation conditions in vivo reveals a direct relationship between sorting of regulated secretory protein and polymer assembly within IGs. By contrast, entry from the trans-Golgi network into IGs does not appear especially selective for regulated secretory proteins. Specifically, in normal islets, lysosomal enzyme precursors enter the stimulus-dependent secretory pathway with comparable efficiency to that of proinsulin. However, within 2 h after synthesis (the same period during which proinsulin processing occurs), newly synthesized hydrolases are fairly efficiently relocated out of the stimulus- dependent pathway. In tunicamycin-treated islets, while entry of new lysosomal enzymes into the regulated secretory pathway continues unperturbed, exit of nonglycosylated hydrolases from this pathway does not occur. Consequently, the ultimate targeting of nonglycosylated hydrolases in beta-cells is to storage granules rather than lysosomes. These results implicate a post-Golgi mechanism for the active removal of lysosomal hydrolases away from condensed granule contents during the storage process for regulated secretory proteins.", "PURPOSE To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing physical function and complications following DIATF surgery with external fixation (EF) or open reduction internal fixation (ORIF). METHOD A search was conducted using PubMed, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, Open Grey and Orthopaedic Proceedings. Studies with a level of evidence of I-III on patients (\u2265 18 years) with DIATFs operated on with either EF or ORIF were included. A total of 3814 studies were identified. The Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for randomised controlled trials and the ROBINS-I tool for nonrandomised studies were used to assess risk of bias. RESULTS Nine studies with 478 patients, 271 ORIF and 197 EF met the inclusion criteria. The mean follow-up ranged from 12 to 38 months. The meta-analysis showed a higher incidence of superficial wound infections (RR = 2.94, 95% CI 1.62-5.34, p = 0.0004) and malunions (RR = 2.62, 95% CI 1.27-5.43, p = 0.009) in the EF group compared to the ORIF group. Also worse physical function was associated with the EF group. However, the overall evidence was low. CONCLUSION This systematic review is the first to report on physical function following DIATF surgery. In general, decreased physical function was reported. The meta-analysis showed lower incidence of superficial wound infection and malunion rates in the ORIF group. Heterogeneity was low. In conclusion, this review reports lower complication rates following ORIF for DIATF. The overall evidence was limited, and therefore, the authors cannot recommend ORIF to be superior to EF treatment for DIATF. More multi-centre studies with larger sample sizes are needed to assess long-term physical function and complications following DIATF surgery. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Level 1.", "Patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE) are prone to the development of both short-term and long-term complications that can substantially affect their functional capacity and quality of life.

It is injected to increase the distance between the prostate and rectum. During the course of external radiotherapy treatment, physiological changes in rectal volume exist. When using polyethylene glycol material, such as DuraSeal(\u00ae) (Covidien, Mansfield, MA), gel resorption also occurs. Together, these factors alter the original dose plan distribution. METHODS External dose planning and calculations were simulated using images acquired from 10 patients who were treated with brachytherapy and gel. The CT series was taken relative to gel injection: pre 1 day, post 1 day, post 1 month and post 2 months. Adaptive planning was compared with a single plan. RESULTS Adaptive planning shows better results compared with the single plan used in the total treatment course; however, the effect is minor. CONCLUSION Gel usage is clearly favourable to rectal DVH. Using adaptive planning with gel improves rectal DVH but is not necessary according to this study. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE Spacer gel is used in prostate radiotherapy to increase distance between the prostate and the rectum, thus reducing the rectal doses. During the treatment course, gel resorption exists which affects the rectal doses. The usefulness of adaptive planning to compensate this resorption effect has not been studied before.", " AND PURPOSE Computed tomographic angiography and magnetic resonance angiography are used increasingly to assess arterial patency in patients with ischemic stroke. We determined which baseline angiography features predict response to intravenous thrombolytics in ischemic stroke using randomized controlled trial data. METHODS We analyzed angiograms from the IST-3 (Third International Stroke Trial), an international, multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled trial of intravenous alteplase. Readers, masked to clinical, treatment, and outcome data, assessed prerandomization computed tomographic angiography and magnetic resonance angiography for presence, extent, location, and completeness of obstruction and collaterals. We compared angiography findings to 6-month functional outcome (Oxford Handicap Scale) and tested for interactions with alteplase, using ordinal regression in adjusted analyses. We also meta-analyzed all available angiography data from other randomized controlled trials of intravenous thrombolytics. RESULTS In IST-3, 300 patients had prerandomization angiography (computed tomographic angiography=271 and magnetic resonance angiography=29). On multivariable analysis, more extensive angiographic obstruction and poor collaterals independently predicted poor outcome (P<0.01). We identified no significant interaction between angiography findings and alteplase effect on Oxford Handicap Scale (P\u22650.075) in IST-3. In meta-analysis (5 trials of alteplase or desmoteplase, including IST-3, n=591), there was a significantly increased benefit of thrombolytics on outcome (odds ratio>1 indicates benefit) in patients with (odds ratio, 2.07; 95% confidence interval, 1.18-3.64; P=0.011) versus without (odds ratio, 0.88; 95% confidence interval, 0.58-1.35; P=0.566) arterial obstruction (P for interaction 0.017). CONCLUSIONS Intravenous thrombolytics provide benefit to stroke patients with computed tomographic angiography or magnetic resonance angiography evidence of arterial obstruction, but the sample was underpowered to demonstrate significant treatment benefit or harm among patients with apparently patent arteries. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION URL: https://www.isrctn.com. Unique identifier: ISRCTN25765518.", "Mechanical ablation of bone marrow in young rats induces rapid but transient bone growth, which can be enhanced and maintained for three weeks by the administration of parathyroid hormone (PTH). Additionally, marrow ablation, followed by PTH treatment for three months leads to increased cortical thickness. In this study, we sought to determine whether PTH enhances bone formation after marrow ablation in aged rats. Aged rats underwent unilateral femoral marrow ablation and treatment with PTH or vehicle for four weeks. Both femurs from each rat were analyzed by X-ray and pQCT, then analyzed either by microCT, histology or biomechanical testing. Marrow ablation alone induced transient bone formation of low abundance that persisted over four weeks, while marrow ablation followed by PTH induced bone formation of high abundance that also persisted over four weeks. Our data confirms that the osteo-inducive effect of marrow ablation and the additive effect of marrow ablation, followed by PTH, occurs in aged rats. Our observations open new avenues of investigations in the field of tissue regeneration. Local marrow ablation, in conjunction with an anabolic agent, might provide a new platform for rapid site-directed bone growth in areas of high bone loss, such as in the hip and wrist, which are subject to fracture.", "Background and Aims The GEMINI long-term safety [LTS] study is a continuing phase 3 trial investigating the safety and efficacy of vedolizumab, an \u03b14\u03b27 integrin antagonist for ulcerative colitis [UC] and Crohn's disease. We provide an interim analysis of efficacy in patients with UC. Methods Patients from the C13004 and GEMINI 1 studies and a cohort of vedolizumab-na\u00efve patients received open-label vedolizumab every 4 weeks. Interim data were collected from May 22, 2009 to June 27, 2013. Clinical response and remission, evaluated using partial Mayo scores, and health-related quality of life [HRQL] were assessed for up to 152 weeks of cumulative treatment in the efficacy population. Results As of June 27, 2013, 63% of the efficacy population [n = 532/845] were continuing treatment. Among patients who responded to vedolizumab induction and had data available, 88% [n = 120/136] were in remission after 104 weeks of exposure (96% [n = 70/73] after 152 weeks). Among patients who withdrew from every-8-week vedolizumab maintenance in GEMINI 1 [n = 32] before week 52, increased dosing to every 4 weeks in GEMINI LTS resulted in response and remission rates of 41% and 28%, respectively, after 52 weeks, an increase from 19% and 6%, respectively, from before the dose increase. Similar benefits were demonstrated regardless of prior tumour necrosis factor-antagonist exposure. Durable benefits on HRQL were also observed. Conclusions Patients with UC experienced clinical and HRQL improvements with continued vedolizumab treatment. Increased dosing frequency to every 4 weeks was beneficial in patients who had loss of response to 8-weekly dosing.", " The treatment of incompetent truncal veins has been innovated by the introduction of minimally invasive non-thermal non-tumescent (NTNT) techniques. One of these consists of the use of cyanoacrylate glue to occlude the vein lumen by means of the VenaSeal device. Areas covered: This expert-review aims to evaluate NTNT ablation of incompetent saphenous trunks using the VenaSeal device. Expert commentary: Cyanoacrylate adhesive embolization of incompetent truncal veins using the VenaSeal device is a safe and efficacious innovative technique. Further studies are needed to evaluate anatomical and clinical outcomes at long term.", "PURPOSE To report hepatic arterial-related complications encountered during planning and treatment angiograms for radioembolization and understand any potential-associated risk factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS 518 mapping or treatment angiograms for 180 patients with primary or metastatic disease to the liver treated by Yttrium-90 radioembolization between 2/2010 and 12/2015 were retrospectively reviewed. Intra-procedural complications were recorded per SIR guidelines. Patient demographics, indication for treatment, prior exposure to chemotherapeutic agents, operator experience, and disease burden were reviewed. Technical variables including type of radioembolic (glass vs. resin microspheres), indication for angiography (mapping vs. treatment), variant anatomy, and attempts at coil embolization were also assessed. RESULTS Thirteen (13/518, 2.5%) arterial-related complications occurred in 13 patients. All but two complications resulted during transcatheter coil embolization to prevent non-target embolization. Complications included coil migration (n = 6), arterial dissection (n = 2), focal vessel perforation (n = 2), arterial thrombus (n = 2), and vasospasm prohibiting further arterial sub-selection (n = 1). Transarterial coiling was identified as a significant risk factor of complications on both univariate and multivariate regression analysis (odds ratio 7.8, P = 0.004). Usage of resin microspheres was also a significant risk factor (odds ratio 9.5, P = 0.042). No other technical parameters or pre-procedural variables were significant after adjusting for confounding on multivariate analysis (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION Intra-procedural hepatic arterial complications encountered during radioembolization were infrequent but occurred mainly during coil embolization to prevent non-target delivery to extra-hepatic arteries.", "Obesity is one of the key noncommunicable diseases leading to significant comorbidities. In recent years, obesity has become a major public health issue and has threatened the wellbeing of millions of patients. Although there are multiple reasons for people becoming obese, sustained positive energy balance - energy intake is greater than energy expenditure - is the key for accumulating excess bodyfat. Prevention of obesity by lifestyle changes, healthy eating and increased physical activity are more cost effective than pharmacotherapy, bariatric surgery or ultimately treating complications of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Not all patients with obesity experience complications such as T2DM. The distribution of bodyfat is important in determining whether a person is obese and healthy or needs medical attention; however, the use of BMI alone will not differentiate this. Obesity patients with excess abdominal fat have the highest risk for T2DM, insulin resistance and thus, higher incidence of cardiovascular diseases. Obesity-associated complications can be reversed through healthy eating habits and increased duration and intensity of physical activity. Increasing work- and leisure-related physical activities increase the energy expenditure, having salutary effects on weightloss programs. Although treating symptoms of obesity and related disorders is important, it is not a solution for the obesity epidemic. Causes that lead to weight-gain need to be identified in individual patients, who should be educated about the causes of weight gain and ways to prevent it, and be provided with simple and practical interventions to lose weight.", "Gastric cancer with metastases outside of the regional lymph nodes is deemed oncologically unresectable. Nevertheless, some metastatic lesions are technically resectable by applying established surgical techniques such as para-aortic lymphadenectomy and hepatectomy. At the time of compilation of the Japanese gastric cancer treatment guidelines version 4, systematic reviews were conducted to see whether it is feasible to make any recommendation to dissect both the primary and metastatic lesions with intent to cure, possibly as part of multimodality treatment. Long-term survivors were found among carefully selected groups of patients both in prospective and retrospective studies. In addition, there is a growing list of publications reporting encouraging outcomes of gastrectomy conducted after exceptionally good response to chemotherapy, usually among patients who underwent R0 resection. This type of surgery is often referred to as conversion surgery. It is sometimes difficult to define a clear borderline between curative surgery scheduled after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and the conversion surgery. This review summarizes what we knew after the literature reviews conducted at the time of compiling the Japanese guidelines and in addition reflects some new findings obtained thereafter through clinical trials and retrospective studies. Metastases were divided into three categories based on the major metastatic pathways: lymphatic, hematogenous, and peritoneal. In each of these categories, there were findings that could provide hope for patients with metastatic disease. These findings implied that the surgical technique that we already use could become more useful upon further developments in antineoplastic agents and drug delivery.", " Leaks after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) are not very frequent but are a difficult complication that can become chronic. Various treatment options have been suggested but no definitive treatment regimen has been established. The aim of our study is to report leak complications after LSG, their management, and outcomes. METHODS Between June 2008 and October 2013, a total of 539 patients underwent laparoscopic and robot-assisted laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy at our institution. A retrospective review of a prospectively collected database was performed for all LSG patients, noting the outcomes and complications of the procedure. RESULTS Fifteen (2.8%) patients presented with a leak after LSG. The diagnosis was made at a mean of 27.2\u00b129.9 days (range, 1-102) after LSG. Eight (53.3%) patients underwent conservative treatment initially and 6 (75.0%) of these patients required stenting as secondary treatment. Although leaks from 3 patients resolved with stenting, the other 3 required restenting and 2 eventually underwent conversion to gastric bypass. Five (33.3%) patients underwent endoscopic intervention, closing the leak with fibrin glue (n=3) or hemoclips (n=2). Two (13.3%) patients who were diagnosed with a leak immediately after LSG before discharge had their leak oversewn laparoscopically with an omental patch. Leaks in 9 (60.0%) patients did not heal after the first intervention, and the mean number of intervention required was 2.3\u00b11.7 times (range, 1-7) for the treatment of this condition. CONCLUSION Management of leaks after LSG can be challenging. Early diagnosis and treatment is important in the management of a leak. However, it can be treated safely via various management options depending on the time of diagnosis and size of the leak.", " Studies have suggested that increasing whole body blood flow and oxygen delivery around the time of surgery reduces mortality, morbidity and the expense of major operations. OBJECTIVES To describe the effects of increasing perioperative blood flow using fluids with or without inotropes or vasoactive drugs. Outcomes were mortality, morbidity, resource utilization and health status. SEARCH METHODS We searched CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to March 2012) and EMBASE (1982 to March 2012). We manually searched the proceedings of major conferences and personal reference databases up to December 2011. We contacted experts in the field and pharmaceutical companies for published and unpublished data. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomized controlled trials with or without blinding. We included studies involving adult patients (aged 16 years or older) undergoing surgery (patients having a procedure in an operating room). The intervention met the following criteria. 'Perioperative' was defined as starting up to 24 hours before surgery and stopping up to six hours after surgery. 'Targeted to increase global blood flow' was defined by explicit measured goals that were greater than in controls, specifically one or more of cardiac index, oxygen delivery, oxygen consumption, stroke volume (and the respective derived indices), mixed venous oxygen saturation (SVO(2)), oxygen extraction ratio (0(2)ER) or lactate. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two authors independently extracted the data. We contacted study authors for additional data. We used Review Manager software. MAIN RESULTS We included 31 studies of 5292 participants. There was no difference in mortality: 282/2615 (10.8%) died in the control group and 238/2677 (8.9%) in the treatment group, RR of 0.89 (95% CI 0.76 to 1.05, P = 0.18). However, the results were sensitive to analytical methods and the intervention was better than control when inverse variance or Mantel-Haenszel random-effects models were used, RR of 0.72 (95% CI 0.55 to 0.95, P = 0.02). The results were also sensitive to withdrawal of studies with methodological limitations. The rates of three morbidities were reduced by increasing global blood flow: renal failure, RR of 0.71 (95% CI 0.57 to 0.90); respiratory failure, RR of 0.51 (95% CI 0.28 to 0.93); and wound infections, RR of 0.65 (95% CI 0.51 to 0.84). There were no differences in the rates of nine other morbidities: arrhythmia, pneumonia, sepsis, abdominal infection, urinary tract infection, myocardial infarction, congestive cardiac failure or pulmonary oedema, or venous thrombosis. The number of patients with complications was reduced by the intervention, RR of 0.68 (95% CI 0.58 to 0.80). Hospital length of stay was reduced in the treatment group by a mean of 1.16 days (95% CI 0.43 to 1.89, P = 0.002). There was no difference in critical care length of stay. There were insufficient data to comment on quality of life and cost effectiveness. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS It remains uncertain whether increasing blood flow using fluids, with or without inotropes or vasoactive drugs, reduces mortality in adults undergoing surgery. The primary analysis in this review (mortality at longest follow-up) showed no difference between the intervention and control, but this result was sensitive to the method of analysis, the withdrawal of studies with methodological limitations, and is dominated by a single large RCT. Overall, for every 100 patients in whom blood flow is increased perioperatively to defined goals, one can expect 13 in 100 patients (from 40/100 to 27/100) to avoid a complication, 2/100 to avoid renal impairment (from 8/100 to 6/100), 5/100 to avoid respiratory failure (from 10/100 to 5/100), and 4/100 to avoid postoperative wound infection (from 10/100 to 6/100). On average, patients receiving the intervention stay in hospital one day less. It is unlikely that the intervention causes harm. The balance of current evidence does not support widespread implementation of this approach to reduce mortality but does suggest that complications and duration of hospital stay are reduced.", "Isolated laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy is increasingly being used for the treatment of morbid obesity. However, doubts still persist regarding long-term weight loss, and the 5-year results are awaited. Whether the aetiology of failed excess weight loss is the result of an inadequate sleeve or attributable to dilatation of the sleeve is not clear. In an effort to prevent gastric dilatation and increase gastric restriction to promote further weight loss in the long term, we performed a combined procedure of laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding with sleeve gastrectomy. The patient was a 39-year-old woman with a life-long history of obesity and a body mass index of 79.8 kg/m(2). The surgical technique of the laparoscopic adjustable gastric banded sleeve gastrectomy is described. There were no immediate complications, and the patient was discharged home on the third postoperative day. She is doing extremely well on clinic follow-up at 6 weeks. To the best of our knowledge, laparoscopic adjustable gastric banded sleeve gastrectomy, as a primary operation, has not been described in the literature. It is hoped that this combined procedure will be most useful in the super-super obese (body mass index > 60) patients. More patients with a long-term follow-up are necessary to provide definitive conclusions regarding long-term benefits and complications of this combined bariatric procedure.", "Ablative therapies have become a great alternative to surgical treatment of hepatic nodules. Some technical difficulties may negatively influence the effectiveness of this therapy, such as lesions located near the diaphragm. The transthoracic approach is commonly used to access these lesions. However, it is associated with an increased risk of complications, such as pneumothorax, hemothorax, alveolar bleeding, and others. We report a case of a radiofrequency ablation of a lesion in the hepatic dome, where an artificially induced pneumothorax was performed to guarantee a safe and effective access. The air was easily injected by a spinal needle and later aspirated by a single-lumen catheter. Induced pneumothorax shoud be considered in ablation of hepatic dome lesions, mainly when the transhepatic access is not appropriate.", "Development of novel antiviral reagents is of great importance for the control of virus spread. Here, Ag2S nanoclusters (NCs) were proved for the first time to possess highly efficient antiviral activity by using porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) as a model of coronavirus. Analyses of virus titers showed that Ag2S NCs significantly suppressed the infection of PEDV by about 3 orders of magnitude at the noncytotoxic concentration at 12 h postinfection, which was further confirmed by the expression of viral proteins. Mechanism investigations indicated that Ag2S NCs treatment inhibits the synthesis of viral negative-strand RNA and viral budding. Ag2S NCs treatment was also found to positively regulate the generation of IFN-stimulating genes (ISGs) and the expression of proinflammation cytokines, which might prevent PEDV infection. This study suggest the novel underlying of Ag2S NCs as a promising therapeutic drug for coronavirus.", "Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2014coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly spread around the world resulting in an acute respiratory illness pandemic. The majority of patients presents with mild symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, about 5% become critically ill and require intensive care treatment. Acute hypoxemic failure with severe dyspnea and an increased respiratory rate (>30/min) usually leads to ICU admission. At that point, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates are typically seen. Patients often develop a severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). To date there is no specific treatment available\u2014the main goal of supportive therapy is to ascertain adequate oxygenation. Early intubation and repeated prone positioning are key elements in treating hypoxemic COVID-19 patients. Strict adherence to basic infection control measures (including hand hygiene) and use of personal protection equipment (PPE) are essential in the care of patients. Procedures that lead to formation of aerosols should be avoided where possible and carried out with utmost precaution.", "Human exposure to high altitude is increasing, through inhabitation of areas of high altitude, expansion of tourism into more remote areas, and air travel exposing passengers to typical altitudes equivalent to 8005 ft (2440 m). With ascent to high altitude, a number of acute and chronic physiological changes occur, influencing all systems of the human body. When considering that cardiac arrest is the second most common cause of death in the mountains and that up to 60% of the elderly have significant heart disease or other health problems, these changes are of particular importance as they may have a significant impact on resuscitation efforts. Current guidelines for resuscitation lack specific recommendations regarding treatment of cardiac arrest after ascent to high altitude or in aircraft. Therefore, we performed a comprehensive search in PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and Scopus databases for studies relevant to resuscitation at high altitude. As no randomized trials evaluating the effects of physiological changes after ascent to high altitude on cardiopulmonary resuscitation were identified, our search was expanded to include all studies addressing important aspects on high altitude physiology which could have a potential impact on the resuscitation of cardiac arrest victims. The aim of this review is to discuss the major physiological changes occurring after ascent to high altitude and their potential effects on cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Based on the available data, specific suggestions are proposed regarding resuscitation at high altitude.", " Dual-antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel after percutaneous coronary intervention reduces the risk for coronary thrombotic events (CTEs) at the expense of increasing risk for major bleeding (MB). Metrics to accurately predict the occurrence of each respective event and inform clinical decision making are lacking. OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to develop and validate separate models to predict risks for out-of-hospital thrombotic and bleeding events after percutaneous coronary intervention with drug-eluting stents. METHODS Using data from 4,190 patients treated with drug-eluting stents and enrolled in the PARIS (Patterns of Non-Adherence to Anti-Platelet Regimen in Stented Patients) registry, separate risk scores were developed to predict CTE (defined as the composite of stent thrombosis or myocardial infarction) and MB (defined as the occurrence of a Bleeding Academic Research Consortium type 3 or 5 bleed). External validation was performed in the ADAPT-DES (Assessment of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy With Drug-Eluting Stents) registry. RESULTS Over 2 years, CTEs occurred in 151 patients (3.8%) and MB in 133 (3.3%). Independent predictors of CTEs included acute coronary syndrome, prior revascularization, diabetes mellitus, renal dysfunction, and current smoking. Independent predictors of MB included older age, body mass index, triple therapy at discharge, anemia, current smoking, and renal dysfunction. Each model displayed moderate levels of discrimination and adequate calibration. CONCLUSIONS Simple risk scores of baseline clinical variables may be useful to predict risks for ischemic and bleeding events after PCI with DES, thereby facilitating clinical decisions surrounding the optimal duration of DAPT. (Patterns of Non-Adherence to Anti-Platelet Regimen in Stented Patients [PARIS]; NCT00998127).", "OBJECTIVE To compare outcomes of vaginal and abdominal hysterectomy procedures in women with benign gynaecological diseases. METHODS This was a prospective study of outcomes of consecutive patients who underwent total vaginal hysterectomy (VH) or abdominal hysterectomy (AH) for benign gynaecological diseases. Patient characteristics before, during, and after the operations were reviewed. Patients were followed up for three months to evaluate postoperative complications. RESULTS This study included a total of 313 patients. 143 patients underwent AH and 170 patients underwent VH. Baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups. There were no intraoperative complications in either group. Operation time, intraoperative blood loss, first postoperative flatus time, time to out-of-bed activity, mean maximum postoperative body temperature, and duration of fever were all significantly shorter and less severe in the VH group compared with the AH group. In addition, vaginal length in the VH group was significantly shorter than in the AH group. CONCLUSIONS Vaginal hysterectomy has advantages over AH in the treatment of benign gynaecological diseases, providing greater efficacy and safety with minimal invasiveness.", "PURPOSE To report the results and complications of a single-center experience of above-the-knee angioplasty via transradial access (TRA). METHODS In a prospective study, 110 consecutive patients (88 men; mean age 72 years, range 37-90) referred for critical limb ischemia (26, 24%) or claudication were eligible for lower limb angioplasty via TRA (patients with TASC D lesions of the superficial femoral artery and below-the-knee lesions were excluded). RESULTS The majority of patients (84, 76%) were treated via a left TRA. A total of 170 lesions were addressed, of which 38 (22%) were occlusions; 113 stents were positioned in 82 patients. The overall technical success rate was 91%, with a 63% success rate in occlusions and a 98% success rate in stenoses; by location, the success rates were 91% in suprainguinal lesions and 90% in infrainguinal lesions. No hemorrhagic or local complications requiring surgery were observed. At 1-month follow-up, 101 patients had a downward shift of at least one category in the Rutherford classification of symptoms (clinical success rate 92%); 18 (16%) patients had occlusion of their access radial artery, but none had symptoms or discomfort. CONCLUSION The present study demonstrates that TRA is a safe and effective approach for lower extremity arterial revascularization, at least for interventionists with longstanding experience in TRA and in selected anatomical subsets.", " Because of its hemostatic and adhesive properties, fibrin glue has been used in many areas of surgical treatment in recent years. One example is hernia repair, where fibrin gluing has become increasingly established as an alternative method for mesh fixation. Clinically, fixation with fibrin glue shows a reduced postoperative complication rate compared to other fixation methods (staples, sutures), particularly with regard to pain. MATERIALS AND METHODS Six different lightweight meshes were tested: TiMesh light, TiMesh extralight, Parietene light, Ultrapro, Optilene LP, and BARD Soft Mesh. Two millimeters Tissucol was used for fixation. Five meshes from each group were tested on muscular tissue with and without fibrin glue. The defined defect was 4.5 cm in diameter. The biomechanical measurements were taken in a standardized way using a materials testing machine. The minimum fixation strength required was 32 N, calculated from a corresponding model. RESULTS The fixation strength measurements without fibrin glue gave a mean value for all 30 meshes of 2.98 N with a SD of 0.92 N. This was far below the 32 N required. With fibrin glue, the mean of all the measurements (30 meshes) was 61.86 +/- 23.0 N (min 34.9 N, max 97.3 N). The lowest value was recorded for Ultrapro (34.9 +/- 12.5 N). All the other meshes had a significantly higher fixation strength when fixed with fibrin glue than Ultrapro (p = 0.001). The best results were found for Optilene LP, and this was significantly better than all the other meshes (97.3 +/- 8.9 N; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION Given the adequate stability and superior biocompatibility of lightweight large pore monofilament polypropylene meshes, heavyweight polypropylene meshes should no longer be used. It is possible to achieve adequate fixation of the meshes using fibrin glue. However, careful consideration should be given to the particular structure of the mesh in each case. Not every mesh is equally suitable for this purpose.", "OBJECTIVE Our objective was to compare the cost effectiveness of stapled haemorrhoidopexy (SH) and traditional haemorrhoidectomy (TH) in the treatment of grade II-IV haemorrhoidal disease from the perspective of the UK national health service. METHODS An economic evaluation was conducted alongside an open, two-arm, parallel-group, pragmatic, multicentre, randomised controlled trial conducted in several hospitals in the UK. Patients were randomised into either SH or TH surgery between January 2011 and August 2014 and were followed up for 24 months. Intervention and subsequent resource use data were collected using case review forms and questionnaires. Benefits were collected using the EQ-5D-3L (EuroQoL-five dimensions-three levels) instrument. The primary economic outcome was incremental cost measured in pounds (\u00a3), year 2016 values, relative to the incremental benefit, which was estimated using quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Cost and benefits accrued in the second year were discounted at 3.5%. The base-case analysis was based on imputed data. Uncertainty was explored using univariate sensitivity analyses. RESULTS Participants (n = 777) were randomised to SH (n = 389) or TH (n = 388). The mean cost of SH was \u00a3337 (95% confidence interval [CI] 251-423) higher than that of TH and the mean QALYs were -0.070 (95% CI -0.127 to -0.011) lower than for TH. The base-case cost-utility analysis indicated that SH has zero probability of being cost effective at both the \u00a320,000 and the \u00a330,000 threshold. Results from the sensitivity analyses were similar to those from the base-case analysis. CONCLUSIONS The evidence suggests that, on average, the total mean costs over the 24-month follow-up period were significantly higher for the SH arm than for the TH arm. The QALYs were also, on average, significantly lower for the SH arm. These results were supported by the sensitivity analyses. Therefore, in terms of cost effectiveness, TH is a superior surgical treatment for the management of grade II-IV haemorrhoids when compared with SH.", "PURPOSE To report the use of parallel grafts to extend the proximal landing zone for stent-graft repair of aortic transection involving an aberrant right subclavian artery (ARSA). CASE REPORT A 28-year-old patient was referred for treatment of traumatic aortic transection with contained rupture at the level of an ARSA. Immediate thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) was planned because of hemodynamic instability. To achieve rapid sealing and maintain perfusion to both subclavian arteries, a chimney stent to the left subclavian artery (LSA) and a periscope stent-graft to the ARSA were deployed successfully. After surgical repair of all fractures, the patient was discharged 1 month after the initial injury in good condition. Imaging follow-up at 10 months showed a stable repair, patent parallel grafts, and no complications. CONCLUSION TEVAR with chimney and periscope grafts proved to be a safe and quick treatment for a patient requiring ARSA repair in acute aortic transection. This technique maintained blood flow to the ARSA and LSA in a totally endovascular approach, which could be very valuable in transection cases where bypass surgery to supra-aortic branches is compromised or deemed challenging due to thoracic wall and/or neck trauma. Parallel grafting can be a valuable tool to address any acute aortic pathology as it can be performed with off-the-shelf devices.", "The large diversity of viruses that exist in human populations are potentially excreted into sewage collection systems and concentrated in sewage sludge. In the U.S., the primary fate of processed sewage sludge (class B biosolids) is application to agricultural land as a soil amendment. To characterize and understand infectious risks associated with land application, and to describe the diversity of viruses in human populations, shotgun viral metagenomics was applied to 10 sewage sludge samples from 5 wastewater treatment plants throughout the continental U.S, each serving between 100,000 and 1,000,000 people. Nearly 330 million DNA sequences were produced and assembled, and annotation resulted in identifying 43 (26 DNA, 17 RNA) different types of human viruses in sewage sludge. Novel insights include the high abundance of newly emerging viruses (e.g., Coronavirus HKU1, Klassevirus, and Cosavirus) the strong representation of respiratory viruses, and the relatively minor abundance and occurrence of Enteroviruses. Viral metagenome sequence annotations were reproducible and independent PCR-based identification of selected viruses suggests that viral metagenomes were a conservative estimate of the true viral occurrence and diversity. These results represent the most complete description of human virus diversity in any wastewater sample to date, provide engineers and environmental scientists with critical information on important viral agents and routes of infection from exposure to wastewater and sewage sludge, and represent a significant leap forward in understanding the pathogen content of class B biosolids.", "PURPOSE To estimate the prevalence, risk factors, prophylactic treatment and impact on mortality for venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) treated in the intensive care unit. METHODS A post hoc analysis of the erythropoietin in traumatic brain injury (EPO-TBI) trial that included twice-weekly lower limb ultrasound screening. Venous thrombotic events were defined as ultrasound-proven proximal deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or clinically detected pulmonary embolism (PE). Results are reported as events, percentages or medians and interquartile range (IQR). Cox regression analysis was used to calculate adjusted hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for time to VTE and death. RESULTS Of 603 patients, 119 (19.7%) developed VTE, mostly comprising DVT (102 patients, 16.9%) with a smaller number of PE events (24 patients, 4.0%). Median time to DVT diagnosis was 6 days (IQR 2-11) and to PE diagnosis 6.5 days (IQR 2-16.5). Mechanical prophylaxis (MP) was used in 91% of patients on day 1, 97% of patients on day 3 and 98% of patients on day 7. Pharmacological prophylaxis was given in 5% of patients on day 1, 30% of patients on day 3 and 57% of patients on day 7. Factors associated with time to VTE were age (HR per year 1.02, 95% CI 1.01-1.03), patient weight (HR per kg 1.01, 95% CI 1-1.02) and TBI severity according to the International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials risk of poor outcome (HR per 10% increase 1.12, 95% CI 1.01-1.25). The development of VTE was not associated with mortality (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.51-1.65). CONCLUSIONS Despite mechanical and pharmacological prophylaxis, VTE occurs in one out of every five patients with TBI treated in the ICU. Higher age, greater weight and greater severity of TBI increase the risk. The development of VTE was not associated with excess mortality.", " AND PURPOSE We hypothesized that permanent stenting may be a rescue treatment for stentriever-failed anterior circulation large artery occlusion. We compared the outcomes among patients with permanent stenting and those without stenting after stentriever failure. METHODS We retrospectively evaluated 208 patients who underwent stentriever thrombectomy for anterior circulation large artery occlusion between September 2010 and September 2015. Modified thrombolysis in cerebral ischemia 2b-3 recanalization was achieved with stentriever alone or in combination with Penumbra device in 155 patients (74.5%). An additional 8 patients (3.8%) obtained modified thrombolysis in cerebral ischemia 2b-3 with urokinase or glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor infusion. Of the remaining 45 patients (21.6%), 17 underwent stenting (stenting group; mean age, 68 years), whereas 28 did not undergo stenting (nonstenting group; mean age, 72 years). The rate of modified thrombolysis in cerebral ischemia 2b-3 in stenting group was assessed, and clinical outcomes were compared between groups. RESULTS There were no differences in clinical and laboratory findings, initial National Institute of Health Stroke Scale score, location of anterior circulation large artery occlusion, and onset-to-puncture time between groups. Modified thrombolysis in cerebral ischemia 2b-3 was achieved in 14 members (83.3%) of the stenting group. Stenting group had more favorable outcomes (modified Rankin Scale score 0-2, 35.3%) and less cerebral herniation (11.8%) than nonstenting group (modified Rankin Scale score 0-2, 7.1%; cerebral herniation, 42.9%; P<0.05 for both). Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and mortality rates did not differ between stenting group (symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, 11.8%; mortality, 23.5%) and nonstenting group (symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, 14.3%; mortality, 39.3%). CONCLUSIONS Permanent stenting may be a rescue modality for stentriever-failed anterior circulation large artery occlusion. A large prospective study is necessary for confirmation because of the small sample size of this study.", "PURPOSE The purpose of this study was to sequentially investigate the biomechanical effects of anterosuperior rotator cuff tear size on superior and anterosuperior translation, including tears interrupting the anterior cable attachment and the anterior force couple. METHODS Five cadaveric shoulders were subjected to different loading conditions in both the superior and anterosuperior directions in the intact state, with the supraspinatus cut and with sequentially larger anterosuperior rotator cuff tears. RESULTS Isolated tears of the supraspinatus had no significant biomechanical consequences under any condition tested. Anterosuperior translation was greater than superior translation in the intact specimen and for every combination of anterosuperior rotator cuff defect. With the supraspinatus and the superior half of the subscapularis (i.e., the anterior cable attachment) released, there was no significant increase in anterosuperior or superior glenohumeral translation in response to lower loading conditions (10 to 20 N). At higher loading conditions (40 to 50 N), tears of the supraspinatus and superior half of the subscapularis led to significantly increased translation in both directions. CONCLUSIONS Simulated anterosuperior rotator cuff tears involving the superior half of the subscapularis significantly alter shoulder biomechanics and lead to increased anterosuperior and superior glenohumeral translation under higher loads. The anterior attachment of the rotator cuff cable is therefore an important determinant of the biomechanics of anterosuperior rotator cuff tears at higher loads but not at lower loads. Preserving the inferior half of the subscapularis was sufficient to maintain relatively normal shoulder kinematics under lower loading conditions. Tears of the entire subscapularis altered glenohumeral kinematics at essentially all loads. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Knowledge of the biomechanics of anterosuperior rotator cuff tears enhances our understanding of how to best treat these lesions.", "Shaofu Zhuyu decoction (SFZY) or Sobokchugeo-tang, a traditional herbal formula, is used as a treatment for primary dysmenorrhea. We searched four English, seven Korean, three Chinese, and one Japanese database from inception through January 2016 without a language restriction. All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of SFZY or modified SFZY (MSFZY) were included. Data extraction and risk of bias assessments were performed by two independent reviewers. A total of 51 potentially relevant studies were identified, and 9 RCTs met our inclusion criteria. Seven RCTs tested the effects of SFZY or modified SFZY in treating dysmenorrhea. Three RCTs showed superior effects of (M)SFZY on the response rate, while the other three RCTs failed to do so (n=531, RR: 1.17, 95% CI: 1.09 to 1.26, P<0.0001, I(2)=0%). Three RCTs showed favorable effects of MSFZY for pain reduction compared with conventional drugs (n=340, SMD: -1.39, 95% CI: -2.23 to -0.55, P=0.01). Two RCTs examined the effects of modified SFZY plus conventional drugs and conventional drugs alone. The meta-analysis showed favorable effects of MSFZY (n=206; RR, 1.12; 95% CI 1.08 to 1.36; P=0.0009, I(2)=0%). Our systemic review and meta-analysis provide suggestive evidence of the superiority of SFZY over conventional drugs for treating primary dysmenorrhea. However, the level of evidence is low because of a high risk of bias.", " Wound closure accounts for a relatively constant portion of the time required to complete a surgical case. Both longer closure times and wound infections contribute to higher medical costs and patient morbidity. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES We therefore determined whether (1) biologic and treatment factors greater influenced wound healing than the choice of sutures or staples; and (2) different times to closure affected cost when sutures or staples are used in patients with musculoskeletal tumors. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed 511 patients who had sarcoma resections of the buttock, thigh, and femur from 2003 to 2010; 376 had closure with sutures and 135 with staples. Data were abstracted on patient demographics, comorbidities, select procedural data, and wound complications. Wound complications were defined by hospitalization within 6 months postoperatively for a wound problem, irrigation and d\u00e9bridement, or infection treated with antibiotics. We determined the association between staples versus sutures and wound complications after controlling for confounding factors. The minimum followup was 2 weeks. A prospective, timed analysis of wounds closed with either sutures or staples was also performed. RESULTS We found an association between obesity and radiation and wound complications. Wounds were closed an average of 5.3 minutes faster with staples than with suture (0.29 minutes versus 5.6 minutes, respectively), saving a mean 2.1% of the total operating time although the total operating time was similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS We found no difference in wound complications after closure with sutures or staples, although obesity and radiation treatment appear to affect wound outcomes. Data suggest that time saved in the operating room by closing with staples compensates for added material costs and does not compromise wound care in patients with lower extremity sarcomas. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Level II, prognostic study. See Guidelines for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.", " This study aimed to compare laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) total extraperitoneal (TEP) repair with conventional laparoscopic TEP repair for the treatment of inguinal hernias. To date, no other studies have compared the LESS and conventional laparoscopic TEP approaches for the treatment of inguinal hernia in a prospective randomized study setting. METHODS For this study, 100 patients undergoing inguinal hernia repair were prospectively randomized into either the LESS TEP group or the conventional laparoscopic TEP group. Pre-, intra-, and postoperative factors were recorded. The primary end point was postoperative pain. The patients were interviewed at outpatient clinics at 1 week, 3 months, and 6 months postoperatively. RESULTS The demographic data were comparable between the two groups. The median operative time was longer in the LESS TEP group (63.5 min) than in the conventional TEP group (50.5 min) (p = 0.001). No conversion was performed in either group. The mean pain score 2 h postoperatively during rest was significantly higher in the conventional TEP group than in the LESS TEP group (3.9 vs. 2.6; p = 0.02). The postoperative results were comparable between the groups in terms of analgesic requirements, systemic stress responses, complications, and postoperative convalescence. CONCLUSIONS The LESS TEP technique is associated with a longer operative time but offers the minor benefit of a reduction in immediate postoperative pain.", "Varicella virus is a neurotropic virus that can reactivate later in life to cause zoster or shingles. Typically, it affects elderly, immunocompromised population. We report an unusual case of an immunocompetent young adult presenting with occipital headache and zoster rash, without preherpetic and postherpetic neuralgia, who was diagnosed with varicella meningitis on Polymerase chain reaction (PCR). He was treated with intravenous acyclovir and later discharged on famciclovir. Diagnosis of varicella meningitis is difficult in the absence of typical features of zoster rash and requires high index of suspicion. Rapid diagnostic tests including varicella PCR and antithecal antibody testing can help in the confirmation of varicella zoster meningitis.", "OBJECT Pediatric cerebral arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) are rare but potentially lethal vascular lesions. Management strategies for these lesions have undergone considerable evolution in the last decade with the advent of new endovascular, surgical, and radiosurgical technologies. This study sought to review current treatment strategies and long-term clinical outcomes at a high-volume cerebrovascular institute. METHODS A retrospective chart review was performed on patients with a diagnosis of cerebral AVF from 1999 to 2012. Patients with carotid-cavernous fistulas, vein of Galen malformations, and age > 18 years were excluded from final analysis. Medical history, surgical and nonsurgical treatment, and clinical outcomes were documented. Pre- and postoperative angiograms were analyzed to assess for obliteration of the fistula. RESULTS Seventeen patients with pial AVFs (29.4%), dural AVFs (64.7%), or mixed pial/dural AVFs (5.9%) were identified. The majority of lesions were paramedian (70.6%) and supratentorial (76.5%). The study population had a mean age of 6.4 years, with a slight male predominance (52.9%), and the most common presenting symptoms were seizures (23.5%), headaches (17.6%), congestive heart failure (11.7%), and enlarging head circumference (11.7%). Among patients who underwent intervention (n = 16), 56.3% were treated with endovascular therapy alone, 6.3% were treated with open surgery alone, and 37.5% required a multimodal approach. Overall, 93.8% of the treated patients received endovascular treatment, 43.8% received open surgery, and 12.5% received radiosurgery. Endovascular embolysates included Onyx (n = 5), N-butyl cyanoacrylate (NBCA; n = 4), or coil embolization (n = 7) with or without balloon assistance (n = 2). Complete angiographic obliteration was achieved in 87.5% at the last follow-up evaluation (mean follow-up 3.1 years). One infant with incomplete AVF obliteration died of congestive heart failure, and 1 patient with complete obliteration died of acute sinus thrombosis, with an overall complication rate of 18.8%. CONCLUSIONS Pediatric cerebral AVFs are challenging neurosurgical lesions. Although advancements in endovascular therapy in the last decade have greatly changed the natural course of this disease, a multidisciplinary approach remains necessary for a large subset of patients. Surgeon experience with a thorough analysis of preoperative imaging is paramount to achieving acceptable clinical outcomes.", "Arteriotomy closure devices (ACDs) are routinely used for vascular closure during invasive cardiovascular procedures. They decrease time to hemostasis as well as length of stay. Major complications such as arterial ischemia and occlusion can be encountered in a minority of patients. We are describing a series of 3 patients with access site closure using Angio-Seal after coronary angiography who developed intermittent claudication within 2-3 weeks of follow-up. Access site thrombosis/stenosis in the CFA was found in all the three cases. They were successfully revascularized using Jetstream atherectomy with embolic protection filter followed by balloon angioplasty. This technique can treat extensive thrombus burden as well as extract the collagen and foot plate of Angio-Seal through atherectomy with cutting blades and thrombectomy via rheolytic macerating aspiration port. All cases had excellent angiographic and clinical results.", " Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are a standard treatment for osteoarthritis (OA), but the use of oral NSAIDs has been linked to an elevated risk for cardiovascular and gastrointestinal adverse events and renal toxicity. Topical NSAIDs are thought to afford efficacy that is comparable to oral formulations while reducing widespread systemic drug exposure, which may provide a benefit in terms of safety and tolerability. As a result, European treatment guidelines have, for many years, recommended the use of topical NSAIDs as a safe and effective treatment option for OA. Following the recent approval of several topical NSAID formulations by the US Food and Drug Administration, US treatment guidelines are increasingly recommending the use of topical NSAIDs as an alternative therapy and, in some cases, as a first-line option for OA. This commentary summarizes OA treatment guidelines that are currently available and discusses their potential evolution with regard to the increased inclusion of topical NSAIDs.", "Endovascular therapy of cerebral venous thrombosis using modern approaches to intracranial recanalization, such as stent retrievers and aspiration thrombectomy, is not well described. We performed a retrospective review of data for consecutive patients with venous sinus thrombosis who underwent endovascular treatment between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2013 at participating institutions. We identified a total of 13 patients with a diagnosis of cerebral venous thrombosis. The most frequently utilized type of endovascular intervention was the Penumbra aspiration system (Penumbra Inc., Alameda, California, USA) (nine cases), followed by local infusion of tissue plasminogen activator (bolus and/or drip in six cases) and stent retrievers (Solitaire FR (Covidien, Irvine, California, USA) in three cases and Trevo (Stryker, Kalamazoo, Michigan, USA) in one case). Overall, multimodality treatment (two or more different types of devices or approaches) was performed in 62% of cases. Follow-up data were available for 11 patients; of those, five had a favorable clinical outcome (defined as modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2) and three patients died. Various endovascular approaches are utilized in current clinical practice. A multimodal approach to endovascular therapy for the treatment of cerebral venous thrombosis resulted in partial or complete restoration of flow in all cases, yet the mortality rate of 27% indicates the need for improvement in recanalization strategies for this disorder.", " Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) affects men and women differently. Not only are women twice as likely as men to develop PTSD, they experience different symptoms and comorbidities associated with PTSD. Yet the dearth of preclinical research on females leaves a notable gap in understanding the underlying neuropathology of this sex difference. METHODS Using two standard measures of PTSD-like responses in rats, the acoustic startle response (ASR) and dexamethasone suppression test (DST), we tested the effects of traumatic stress in adult male and female rats using two rodent models of PTSD, single prolonged stress and predator exposure. We then examined the neural correlates underlying these responses with cFos and glucocorticoid receptor immunohistochemistry in brain regions implicated in the traumatic stress response. RESULTS We now report that adult male and female rats across two models of PTSD show consistent sex-specific responses that recapitulate fundamental differences of PTSD in men and women. Trauma-exposed males showed the well-established hyper-responsive phenotype of enhanced ASR and exaggerated negative feedback control of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, while the same traumatic event had little effect on these same measures in females. Dramatic sex differences in how trauma affected cFos and glucocorticoid receptor expression in the brain lend further support to the idea that the trauma response of male and female rats is fundamentally different. CONCLUSIONS Two standard measures, ASR and DST, might suggest that females are resilient to the effects of traumatic stress, but other measures make it clear that females are not resilient, but simply respond differently to trauma. The next important question to answer is why. We conclude that males and females show fundamentally different responses to trauma that do not simply reflect differences in resilience. The divergent effects of trauma in the brains of males and females begin to shed light on the neurobiological underpinnings of these sex differences, paving the way for improved diagnostics and therapeutics that effectively treat both men and women.", "A three-year-old male greyhound was presented with acute onset right forelimb lameness because of medial displacement of the biceps tendon of origin. Ultrasonographic examination confirmed the diagnosis, and a concomitant partial tear of the medial glenohumeral ligament was detected during arthroscopy. To stabilise the biceps tendon, polypropylene mesh was fixed across the intertubercular groove to replace the torn transverse humeral retinaculum. Recovery was uneventful and lameness resolved. Fifteen months later, the dog was presented with medial displacement of the biceps tendon of origin of the left shoulder, and was treated successfully using the same technique.", " Endovascular recanalization of a completely occluded proximal internal carotid artery (ICA) with underlying stenosis may be challenging owing to a possible thrombotic component. This is especially true when the landing zone for a balloon-tipped guiding catheter (BGC) at the bulb portion is insufficient. Sequential application of the balloons of a BGC and an angioplasty catheter may prevent thromboembolism during revascularization. This study analyzed the safety and effectiveness of this relay-balloon technique. METHODS Ten consecutive patients with acute symptomatic proximal ICA occlusion were treated by the relay-balloon technique. Outcomes analyzed included technical success rate, procedure-related complications, and short-term clinical outcomes. RESULTS Successful revascularization was achieved in all 10 patients. One patient experienced a post-procedural infarct extension, but there was no change in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score. Mean NIHSS score decreased from 12.0\u00b15.6 (range 0-18) initially to 6.8\u00b15.4 (range 0-18) at discharge. CONCLUSIONS The relay-balloon technique is safe and effective in the endovascular revascularization of acute symptomatic proximal ICA occlusions, which are at high risk of distal thromboembolism due to insufficient landing zone for the BGC.", "OPINION STATEMENT The need to develop highly qualified, multidisciplinary critical limb ischemia (CLI) programs has gained significant momentum. Due to the systemic nature of the disease, patients with CLI are inherently medically complex and often present with multiple comorbidities. Successful care for these patients depends on community screening, early referral, accurate diagnosis, risk stratification, risk factor modification, invasive and non-invasive treatment strategies, and appropriate surveillance. Patients with CLI are often treated by multiple subspecialists-often lacking a unified team which could lead to inefficiencies and redundancy. Establishing an effective critical limb ischemia program relies on the joint efforts of multiple physician specialists, nurses, technicians, wound care specialists, researchers, and administrators who together form an integrated network that is easily accessible to the patient.
