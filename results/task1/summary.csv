Disease primers,,"Colorectal cancer had a low incidence several decades ago. However, it has become a predominant cancer and now accounts for approximately 10% of cancer-related mortality in western countries. The 'rise' of colorectal cancer in developed countries can be attributed to the increasingly ageing population, unfavourable modern dietary habits and an increase in risk factors, such as smoking, low physical exercise and obesity. New treatments for primary and metastatic colorectal cancer have emerged, providing additional options for patients; these treatments include laparoscopic surgery for primary disease, more-aggressive resection of metastatic disease (such as liver and pulmonary metastases), radiotherapy for rectal cancer, and neoadjuvant and palliative chemotherapies. However, these new treatment options have had limited impact on cure rates and long-term survival. For these reasons, and the recognition that colorectal cancer is long preceded by a polypoid precursor, screening programmes have gained momentum.

We estimate (i) the time and treatment scale-up required to achieve the World Health Organization's HCV elimination target of an 80% reduction in incidence; and (ii) the ongoing frequency of HCV testing and harm reduction coverage among people who inject drugs (PWID) required to minimize the likelihood of future HCV outbreaks occurring. METHODS We used a dynamic compartmental model of HCV transmission, liver disease progression and the HCV cascade of care, calibrated to reproduce the epidemic of HCV in Iceland. The model was stratified according to injecting drug use status, age and stage of engagement. Four scenarios were considered for the projections. RESULTS The model estimated that an 80% reduction in domestic HCV incidence was achievable by 2030, 2025 or 2020 if a minimum of 55/1,000, 75/1,000 and 188/1,000 PWID were treated per year, respectively (a total of 22, 30 and 75 of the estimated 400 PWID in Iceland per year, respectively). Regardless of time frame, this required an increased number of PWID to be diagnosed to generate enough treatment demand, or a 20% scale-up of harm reduction services to complement treatment-as-prevention incidence reductions. When DAA scale-up was combined with annual antibody testing of PWID, the incidence reduction target was reached by 2024. Treatment scale-up with no other changes to current testing and harm reduction services reduced the basic reproduction number of HCV from 1.08 to 0.59, indicating that future outbreaks would be unlikely. CONCLUSION HCV elimination in Iceland is achievable by 2020 with some additional screening of PWID. Maintaining current monitoring and harm reduction services while providing ongoing access to DAA therapy for people diagnosed with HCV would ensure that outbreaks are unlikely to occur once elimination targets have been reached. LAY SUMMARY In Iceland, a nationwide program has been launched offering treatment for the entire population living with hepatitis C virus (HCV). A mathematical model was used to estimate the additional health system requirements to achieve the HCV elimination targets of the World Health Organization (WHO), as well as the year that this could occur. With some additional screening of people who inject drugs, Iceland could reach the WHO targets by 2020, becoming one of the first countries to achieve HCV elimination. The model estimated that once elimination targets were reached, maintaining current monitoring and harm reduction services while providing ongoing access to DAA therapy for people diagnosed with HCV would ensure that future HCV outbreaks are unlikely to occur.",wrp48q3y

Uniportal thoracoscopic procedures seem to offer substantial benefit in terms of postoperative pain and cosmesis with similar outcomes as other surgical techniques. A 60-year-old female patient was referred to our clinic for the surgical treatment of diaphragmatic eventration of an unknown cause. The patient was referred to our institution from another hospital, where she had undergone a femoro-popliteal and crural bypass which was unsuccessful, requiring amputation of her leg. Following surgery, she was unable to breath spontaneously without any specific reason. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging showed no pathology and the neurologists did not have a diagnosis for her comatose state. There was consensus in both hospitals that surgical plication of her elevated diaphragm might be the only option for respiratory improvement. We performed a double-lined diaphragmatic plication procedure by means of uniportal video-assisted thoracic surgery technique with CO2 insufflation using GelPort. Despite the time-consuming adhesiolysis and the need for lung suturing at the end of the procedure, the operative time was 120 min.

STUDY DESIGN Retrospective cohort study (Canadian Task Force classification II2). All procedures were performed by one surgeon between January 2004 and July 2012. Data was collected via chart review. SETTING Tertiary referral center for treatment of endometriosis. PATIENTS Four hundred twenty women with advanced endometriosis. INTERVENTIONS Fertility-sparing surgery to treat advanced endometriosis, either via conventional or robotic-assisted laparoscopy. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Patient demographic data, operative time, estimated blood loss, complication rate, and length of hospital stay were compared between the 2 groups. Two hundred seventy-three patients underwent conventional laparoscopy and 147 patients underwent robotic-assisted laparoscopy for fertility-sparing treatment of advanced stage endometriosis. Patients in both groups had similar characteristics insofar as age, body mass index, and previous abdominal surgeries. There were no significant differences in blood loss or complication rate between the 2 groups. Mean operative time in the conventional laparoscopy group was 135 minutes (range, 115-156 minutes), and in the robotic-assisted laparoscopy group was 196 minutes (range, 185-209 minutes), with a mean difference in operative time of 61 minutes (p < .001). Length of hospital stay was also significantly increased in the robotic-assisted laparoscopy group. Most patients who underwent conventional laparoscopy were discharged to home on the day of surgery. Of 273 patients in the conventional laparoscopy group, only 63 remained in the hospital overnight, and all 147 patients in the robotic-assisted laparoscopy group were discharged on postoperative day 1. CONCLUSION Conventional laparoscopy and robotic-assisted laparoscopy are excellent methods for treatment of advanced stages of endometriosis. However, use of the robotic platform may increase operative time and might also be associated with longer hospital stay.",sbkbzm03

This study aimed to delineate human midfacial strain patterns under uniform muscle loading. The left sides of 5 fresh-frozen human cadaveric heads were dissected of all soft tissues except the temporalis and masseter muscles. Tensile forces were applied to the free mandibular ends of the muscles. Maxillary alveolar arches were used to restrain the skulls. Eight strain gauges were bonded to the surface of the midface to measure the strain under single muscle loading conditions (100 N). Maxillary strain gauges revealed a biaxial load state for both muscles. Thin antral bone experienced high maximum principal tensile strains (maximum of 685.5 με) and high minimum principal compressive strains (maximum of -722.44 με). Similar biaxial patterns of lower magnitude were measured on the zygoma (maximum of 208.59 με for maximum principal strains and -78.11 με for minimum principal strains). Results, consistent for all specimens and counter to previously accepted concepts of biomechanical behavior of the midface under masticatory muscle loading, included high strain in the thin maxillary antral wall, rotational bending through the maxilla and zygoma, and a previously underestimated contribution of the temporalis muscle. This experimental model produced repeatable strain patterns quantifying the mechanics of the facial skeleton. These new counterintuitive findings underscore the need for accurate characterization of craniofacial strain patterns to address problems in the current treatment methods and develop robust design criteria.",48h7ibf3

The objective of this study is to determine whether specific antidepressant effects, estimated by drug-placebo differences, are reduced in anxious depression during treatment of MDD with duloxetine. METHODS This is a retrospective secondary pooled analysis of all placebo-controlled trials of duloxetine at therapeutic doses conducted by the sponsor in outpatients with nonpsychotic unipolar MDD, using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD). Anxious depression was defined by > or =7 on the anxiety/somatization factor of the HAMD. Response was defined as > or =50% improvement from baseline to endpoint on the HAMD. Remission was defined as an endpoint HAMD< or =7. Analyses were performed in the intent-to-treat sample with at least one post-treatment rating. RESULTS Eleven trials included 2,841 patients of whom 1,326 were classified as anxious and 1,515 as nonanxious. Change on the HAMD was greater with duloxetine than placebo in both anxious (9.91 versus 7.55, P<.001) and nonanxious (6.65 versus 5.23, P<.001) patients. Level of anxiety had no effect on the drug-placebo differences. Response and remission rates were significantly greater in duloxetine than placebo-treated patients and drug-placebo differences were unaffected by anxious status. Use of HAMD items psychic and somatic anxiety to define anxious subgroups had similar outcomes. CONCLUSIONS Duloxetine was more effective than placebo in achieving response and remission in both anxious and nonanxious patients.

We aimed to investigate the effects produced by a new-generation MWA system on human liver in vivo with different approaches (percutaneous or intraoperative) and liver conditions (cirrhosis or previous chemotherapy treatment), in comparison with manufacturer-provided predictions based on ex vivo animal models. Complete tumor ablation (CA) and early clinical outcomes were also assessed. From October 2014, 60 consecutive patients (cirrhotic = 31; non-cirrhotic = 10; chemotherapy-treated = 19) with 81 liver nodules (HCC = 31; mets = 50) underwent MWA procedures (percutaneous = 30; laparotomic = 18; laparoscopic = 12), with a 2450 MHz/100 W generator with Thermosphere™ Technology (Emprint™, Medtronic). A contrast-enhanced CT or MR was performed after one month to assess CA and measure AZ. A linear correlation between AZ volumes and ablation times was observed in vivo, without differences from manufacturer-provided ex vivo predictions in all operative approaches and liver conditions. Other independent variables (sex, age, nodule location) showed no relationship when added to the model. Median (IQR) longitudinal and transverse roundness-indexes of the AZs were, respectively, 0.77(0.13) and 0.93(0.11). CA at 1 month was 93% for percutaneous and 100% for intraoperative procedures (p = 0.175). Thirty-day morbidity and mortality were 3% and 0%.

We devised a novel technique to quantify blood permeating through thrombi and determine whether this parameter predicts early recanalization with intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator. METHODS Intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator-treated patients with stroke and complete occlusion on computed tomographic angiography were analyzed using perfusion computed tomography and a delay insensitive algorithm. We generated maps that measure delay in arrival time of contrast within the intracranial arterial tree (T0 maps). A positive sloped regression line of T0 values measured along artery silhouette distal to thrombus was defined as marker of permeable thrombus (occult anterograde flow). Median T0 values at proximal and distal thrombus interface were measured. Early recanalization was assessed on first angiography of subsequent intra-arterial procedure or on a 4-hour computed tomographic angiography. RESULTS Of 66 patients, occult anterograde flow was detected in 17 (25.8%). Early recanalization was more in patients with occult anterograde flow versus not (66.7 versus 29.7%; P=0.031). Median T0 value (in s) at distal thrombus interface (1.5 versus 3.8; P=0.006) and difference in median T0 value between proximal and distal thrombus interface (1.3 versus 3.7; P=0.014) were less in early recanalizers versus in nonrecanalizers. In multivariable analysis, patients with occult anterograde flow and T0 value difference between proximal and distal thrombus interface ≤2 s recanalized most (71.4%; odds ratio, 12.15; 95% confidence interval, 2.05-71.91), whereas patients with retrograde flow and T0 value difference >2 s recanalized least (25.9%; odds ratio, 1). CONCLUSIONS Occult anterograde flow through thrombus can be assessed by perfusion computed tomography T0 maps and predicts early recanalization with intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator robustly.",fovnxxpr

However, the effect of HI-NPPV compared with spontaneous breathing (SB) on minute ventilation (MV) in patients receiving long-term treatment remains to be determined. This study compared MV during HI-NPPV and SB. In addition, the ability of intelligent volume assured pressure support (iVAPS) to increase MV to the same extent as HI-NPPV was determined. METHODS Daytime pneumotachographic measurements were performed during SB, HI-NPPV and iVAPS. RESULTS Twenty-seven stable hypercapnic COPD patients (mean FEV1 34 ± 15% predicted) who had been treated with HI-NPPV for a median of 22 months (interquartile range 8.5-84 months) were enrolled. Mean MV was 9.5 ± 1.7 L/min during SB and 12.1 ± 2.8 L/min during HI-NPPV, an increase of 2.5 L/min (95% CI [1.5-3.6] p < 0.001), or 26%. MV during iVAPS was 11.7 ± 3.6 L/min, an increase of 1.8 L/min (95%CI [0.7-3.0], p = 0.003) compared with SB. There was no difference in MV between HI-NPPV and iVAPS (p = 0.25). CONCLUSION Long-term HI-NPPV increased MV by an average of 26% compared with SB in stable hypercapnic COPD patients. A similar increase in MV was observed during use of iVAPS.",y7je28je

Methods: Minimally invasive autopsies from the spleen were carried out on 10 patients who died from COVID-19 in Wuhan. Routine hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining was used to observe the pathological changes. The changes of lymphocytes were studied further with immunohistochemistry.RT-PCR was used to detect 2019-nCov RNA in the spleen. In addition, the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was detected by in situ hybridization, and coronavirus particles were detected by transmission electron microscopy in 2 cases. Results: There were 7 males and 3 females, with an average age of 68.3 years. Of the 10 cases, 4 had cancer history and another 4 had other underlying diseases respectively. Cough, fever, malaise and dyspnea were the main clinical symptoms. The time from onset to death was 15-45 days. 10 cases patients had normal or slight increase in peripheral blood leukocyte count in the early stage of the disease, 6 cases had significant increase before death. Five patients' peripheral blood lymphocyte count decreased in the early stage of the disease, and 10 patients' peripheral blood lymphocyte count decreased significantly before the disease progressed or died. Seven cases were treated with corticosteroid (methylprednisolone ≤40 mg/d, not more than 5 days). Histopathological examination showed that the cell composition of the spleen decreased, white pulp atrophied at different levels, meanwhile lymphoid follicles decreased or absent; in addition, the ratio of red pulp to white pulp increased with varying degrees. In 7 cases, more neutrophil infiltration was found, and in 5 cases, scattered plasma cell infiltration was found. Macrophage proliferation and hemophagocytic phenomena in a few cells were found in a case. Meanwhile, necrosis and lymphocytic apoptosis were detected in 2 cases, small artery thrombosis and spleen infarction in 1 case, and fungal infection in 1 case. The results of immunohistochemistry showed that the T and B lymphocyte components of the spleen in all cases decreased in varying degrees. CD20(+)B cells were found to accumulate in the lymphoid sheath around the splenic artery in 8 cases. However, CD20 and CD21 immunostaining in 2 cases showed that the number of white pulp was almost normal, and splenic nodules were atrophic. CD3(+), CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were decreased. In 9 cases,CD68+ macrophages were no significant changes in the distribution and quantity. While more CD68+ cells were found in the medullary sinuses of 1 case (related to fungal infection). Few CD56(+) cells were found. EBV was negative by in situ hybridization. RT-PCR was used to detect the nucleic acid of 2019-nCov virus. One of 10 cases was positive, 39 years old, who was the youngest patient in this group, and the other 9 cases were negative. Coronavirus particles were found in the cytoplasm of macrophage under electron microscope in 2 cases. Conclusion: The death of COVID-19 occursmainly in the elderly, and some cases have no underlying diseases. Spleen maybe one of the organs directly attacked by the virus in some patients who died from COVID-19. T and B lymphocyte in the spleen decrease in varying degrees, lymphoid follicles are atrophied, decreased or absent, and the number of NK cells do not change significantly. And the pathological changes of the spleen are not related to the use of low dose corticosteroid, which may be related to the direct attack of virus and the attack of immune system on its own tissues.",s6cd9m67

This study analyzed the risk factors and management of hemorrhagic complications, such as hemoperitoneum, hemothorax, and hemobilia. METHODS We performed 4133 RFA treatments in 2154 patients with primary and metastatic liver tumors from February 1999 to December 2007. Of these, we enrolled patients with hemorrhagic complications and reviewed their medical records thoroughly. The risk factors for each hemorrhagic complication were analyzed using unconditional logistic regression. RESULTS Hemorrhagic complications occurred in 63 out of 4133 treatments (1.5%), including hemoperitoneum in 29 (0.7%), hemothorax in 14 (0.3%), and hemobilia in 20 (0.5%). Eleven, 8, and 4 of these patients, respectively, were categorized as major complications requiring blood transfusion or drainage. Two patients died after hemoperitoneum. Logistic regression analysis revealed large tumor size [odds ratio (OR) 1.06 per 1 mm increase in diameter] and low platelet count (OR 0.88 per 10,000/microL increase) were significant risk factors for hemoperitoneum. The location of tumor nodules was a significant risk factor for hemothorax (segment 7, OR 2.31) and hemobilia (segment 1, OR 3.30). Other factors, including the number of needle insertions or the duration of ablation, were not significant. CONCLUSIONS Although hemorrhagic complications were relatively rare with percutaneous RFA, specific treatments, such as blood transfusion and drainage, were required in some cases. Care must be taken, especially in high-risk patients.",o692zuj6

However, some experience is required to get accustomed to its unpredictable fluoroscopic visibility during injection. This in vitro study aimed to evaluate the characteristics of radiopacity change in a simulated embolization procedure. MATERIALS AND METHODS Using a bench-top Onyx injection experiment simulating a typical brain arteriovenous malformation embolization, nine cycles of casting modes (continuous injection) and plugging modes (injection with intermittent pauses) were performed. Radiodensity of Onyx droplets collected from the microcatheter tip and the distal head portion of the microcatheter were measured as time lapsed. Distribution of droplet radiodensity (radiodensity) and distribution of radiographic grade (grade) were analyzed and compared by repeated measurements. RESULTS Within-group analysis revealed no significant radiodensity change with time (P>0.05). The radiodensity was significantly higher in the casting mode than in the plugging mode (P<0.01). The lateral radiograph of the microcatheter showed higher radiopacity (P<0.01) and better evenness (P<0.01) in the casting mode than in the plugging mode. A significant difference in microcatheter attenuation (both radiographic grade mean and SD; P<0.01) was noted between the two modes. Radiodensity had a significant influence on the radiopacity and radiopacity evenness of the microcatheter. CONCLUSION The radiopacity of the Onyx can vary significantly over time because of early precipitation of tantalum powder. Radiopacity decreased significantly during plugging modes, characterized by pauses between injections.",xacqbs2c

Here, we have uncovered an immunosuppressive role for nonclassical Ly6Clo monocytes that mediates resistance to anti-VEGFR2 treatment. We found that the chemokine CX3CL1 was upregulated in both human and murine tumors following VEGF signaling blockade, resulting in recruitment of CX3CR1+Ly6Clo monocytes into the tumor. We also found that treatment with VEGFA reduced expression of CX3CL1 in endothelial cells in vitro. Intravital microscopy revealed that CX3CR1 is critical for Ly6Clo monocyte transmigration across the endothelium in murine CRC tumors. Moreover, Ly6Clo monocytes recruit Ly6G+ neutrophils via CXCL5 and produce IL-10, which inhibits adaptive immunity. Preventing Ly6Clo monocyte or Ly6G+ neutrophil infiltration into tumors enhanced inhibition of tumor growth with anti-VEGFR2 therapy. Furthermore, a gene therapy using a nanoparticle formulated with an siRNA against CX3CL1 reduced Ly6Clo monocyte recruitment and improved outcome of anti-VEGFR2 therapy in mouse CRCs. Our study unveils an immunosuppressive function of Ly6Clo monocytes that, to our knowledge, has yet to be reported in any context. We also reveal molecular mechanisms underlying antiangiogenic treatment resistance, suggesting potential immunomodulatory strategies to enhance the long-term clinical outcome of anti-VEGF therapies.",fvcdpxvs

The exact physiologic mechanism is not completely understood. Surgical reversal to the original anatomy and distal or total pancreatectomy are current therapeutic options to reverse the hypoglycemic effect, with substantial associated morbidity. Our group reports a pilot clinical series of a novel surgical technique using one-anastomosis jejunal interposition with gastric remnant resection (Branco-Zorron Switch). METHODS Patients with severe symptomatic hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia refractory to conservative therapy were treated using the technique. The procedure started with resection of the remnant stomach close to pylorus. The alimentary limb was sectioned at 20 cm from the gastrojejunal anastomosis, and the rest of the alimentary limb was resected until the Y-Roux anastomosis. A hand-sutured anastomosis was then performed with the proximal alimentary limb and the remnant antrum. RESULTS Four patients were successfully submitted to the procedure with reversal of the symptomatology and normalization of insulin levels, postprandial glucose levels, and oral glucose tolerance test, with a mean follow-up of 24.3 months. Mean operative time was 188 min, and patients recovered without postoperative complications. CONCLUSION Patients suffering from severe hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia after gastric bypass may be efficiently treated by this innovative procedure, avoiding extreme surgical therapy such as pancreatectomy or restoring the gastric anatomy, while still maintaining sustained weight loss. Studies with larger series and longer follow-up are still needed to define the role of this therapy in managing this entity.",d3m69ea9

It remains unclear to what extent the treatment-related reduction in follow-up infarct volume (FIV) explains the improved functional outcome after EVT in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Objective To study whether FIV mediates the relationship between EVT and functional outcome in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Design, Setting, and Participants Patient data from 7 randomized multicenter trials were pooled. These trials were conducted between December 2010 and April 2015 and included 1764 patients randomly assigned to receive either EVT or standard care (control). Follow-up infarct volume was assessed on computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging after stroke onset. Mediation analysis was performed to examine the potential causal chain in which FIV may mediate the relationship between EVT and functional outcome. A total of 1690 patients met the inclusion criteria. Twenty-five additional patients were excluded, resulting in a total of 1665 patients, including 821 (49.3%) in the EVT group and 844 (50.7%) in the control group. Data were analyzed from January to June 2017. Main Outcome and Measure The 90-day functional outcome via the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Results Among 1665 patients, the median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 68 (57-76) years, and 781 (46.9%) were female. The median (IQR) time to FIV measurement was 30 (24-237) hours. The median (IQR) FIV was 41 (14-120) mL. Patients in the EVT group had significantly smaller FIVs compared with patients in the control group (median [IQR] FIV, 33 [11-99] vs 51 [18-134] mL; P = .007) and lower mRS scores at 90 days (median [IQR] score, 3 [1-4] vs 4 [2-5]). Follow-up infarct volume was a predictor of functional outcome (adjusted common odds ratio, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.39-0.54; P < .001). Follow-up infarct volume partially mediated the relationship between treatment type with mRS score, as EVT was still significantly associated with functional outcome after adjustment for FIV (adjusted common odds ratio, 2.22; 95% CI, 1.52-3.21; P < .001). Treatment-reduced FIV explained 12% (95% CI, 1-19) of the relationship between EVT and functional outcome. Conclusions and Relevance In this analysis, follow-up infarct volume predicted functional outcome; however, a reduced infarct volume after treatment with EVT only explained 12% of the treatment benefit. Follow-up infarct volume as measured on computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging is not a valid proxy for estimating treatment effect in phase II and III trials of acute ischemic stroke.",0qiet263

We surveyed general surgery graduates to assess the relationships among rotation satisfaction, CT disease exposure, rotation length, mentorship, and mistreatment. DESIGN A survey assessing CT curriculum, exposure, mentorship, and satisfaction was forwarded to general surgery graduates from 17 residency programs. A Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to assess statistical significance of ordinal level data. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. SETTING This study was conducted at the University of Michigan Health System in Ann Arbor, MI, a tertiary care center. PARTICIPANTS The survey was sent to approximately 1300 graduates of general surgery residency programs who graduated between the years of 1999 to 2014. A total of 94 responses were completed and received. RESULTS Receiving adequate exposure to CT procedures and disease management was significantly associated with higher satisfaction ratings for all procedures, particularly thoracotomy incisions (p < 0.001), empyemas and pleural effusions (p < 0.001), and lung cancer care (p < 0.001). The absence of mistreatment and good/very good mentorship were both positively associated with higher reported satisfaction (p = 0.018 and p < 0.001, respectively). Increased length of time on CT rotation was neither associated with improved levels of satisfaction nor with an improvement in the quality of mentorship. CONCLUSION Rotation satisfaction is positively associated with procedure exposure, better mentorship, and the absence of mistreatment. Longer rotation length was not associated with satisfaction. Shorter rotations are not detrimental to training if they have focused clinical exposure and invested mentors to maximize resident satisfaction. These specific markers of rotation quality are useful in curricular design.",81yvjwdy

The effects were also studied in keratinocytes as a prototype for somatic cells. METHODS HESC (H1) and human keratinocytes (HaCaT, human) were exposed to (125)I-dU (5 × 10(-5) - 5 MBq/ml) and (131)I-iodide (5 × 10(-5) - 12.5 MBq/ml) and apoptosis was measured by DNA-fragmentation. Cell morphology was studied by light microscopy and electron microscopy. Transcriptional profiling was done on the Agilent oligonucleotide microarray platform. RESULTS Auger-process induced no apoptosis but a strong transcriptional response in hESC. In contrast, HaCaT cells showed a pronounced induction of apoptosis but only a moderate transcriptional response. Transcriptional response of hESC was similar after (125)I-dU and (131)I treatments, whereas HaCaT cells expressed a much more pronounced response to (125)I-dU than to (131)I. A striking radiation-induced down-regulation of pluripotency genes was observed in hESC whereas in keratinocytes the enriched gene annotations were related primarily to apoptosis, cell division and proliferation. CONCLUSIONS Human embryonic stem cells respond to ionizing radiation by (125)I-dU and (131)I in a different way compared to keratinocytes. Transcriptional response and gene expression appear to facilitate an escape from programmed cell death by striking a new path which probably leads to cell differentiation.",giu2v4qw

We aimed to describe the outcomes of critically ill ECMO patients undergoing emergency abdominal surgery compared to non-ECMO patients. STUDY DESIGN This is a retrospective case-matched single-center study with propensity score analysis in a tertiary ICU. All patients who underwent abdominal surgery were included. RESULTS From 2006 to 2014, 77 patients admitted in our ICU underwent emergency abdominal surgery, 35 were on ECMO. Surgery indications were comparable for ECMO and non-ECMO patients: mostly intestinal ischemia (42%) and cholecystectomy (25%). Postoperative bleeding was significantly more frequent in ECMO group versus non-ECMO: 77% versus 40% transfused, with medians of 13 (6-22) versus 3 (0-5) packed red blood cell; 9 (3-17) versus 0 (0-4) fresh frozen plasma and 12 (3-22) versus 0 (0-8) platelet units (p < 0.001 for all items). Reintervention for hemorrhage was required in 20% versus 2%, respectively, p = 0.02. At multivariable analysis, ECMO was strongly associated with bleeding (OR, 5.6 [95% CI, 2.0-15.4]; p = 0.001). ICU mortality was higher for ECMO-treated patients (69% vs. 33%; p = 0.003), but perioperative mortality remained comparable between groups (11% vs. 12%, NS). Propensity score-matched analysis confirmed more frequent and severe bleeding in ECMO patients. CONCLUSIONS Abdominal surgery procedures on ECMO-treated patients are associated with a higher risk of hemorrhage compared to non-ECMO ICU patients. Further studies are needed to optimize ECMO patient management during such interventions.",nkk5vqem

Among the 25 cases, 14 were males and 11 were females. The median age was 11.0 (6.3-14.5) years (range 0.6-17.0 years). All children were related to a family cluster outbreak, and 7 children (28%) with a travel or residence history in Hubei Province. These patients could be categorized into different clinical types, including 8 (32%) asymptomatic, 4 (16%) very mild cases and 13 (52%) common cases. No severe or critical cases were identified. The most common symptoms were cough (13 cases, 52%) and fever (6 cases, 24%). The duration time of clinical symptoms was 13.0 (8.0-25.0) days. In the 25 cases, on admission, 21 cases (84%) had normal white blood cell counts, while only 2 cases (8%) more than 10 × 10/L and 2 cases (8%) less than 4 × 10/L, respectively; 22 cases(88%) had normal CD4+ T lymphocyte counts, while in the remaining 3 cases(8%) this increased mildly; 23 cases had normal CD8+ T lymphocyte counts, while in the remaining 2 cases (8%) CD8+ T lymphocyte counts were mildly increased as well. All Lymphocyte counts were normal. There were no statistical differences of lab results between the groups of asymptomatic cases, mild cases and common cases. There were only 13 cases with abnormal CT imaging, most of which were located in the subpleural area of the bottom of the lung. All patients were treated with interferon, 6 cases combined with Ribavirin, and 12 cases combined with lopinavir or ritonavir. The days from onset to RNA turning negative was 15.20 ± 6.54 days. There was no significant difference of RNA turning negative between the groups of interferon, interferon plus ribavirin and interferon plus lopinavir or ritonavir treatment. All the cases recovered and were discharged from hospital. CONCLUSIONS The morbidity of 2019-nCoV infection in children is lower than in adults and the clinical manifestations and inflammatory biomarkers in children are nonspecific and milder than that in adults. RNA-PCR test is still the most reliable diagnostic method, especially for asymptomatic patients.",yydc7ksy

The beginning of 2020 has seen the emergence of COVID-19, an outbreak caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, an important pathogen for humans. SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus containing 29891 nucleotides encoding 9889 amino acids. The genome is arranged as 5p-replicase (orf1/ab)-structural proteins [Spike (S) -Envelope (E) - Membrane (M) -Nucleocapsid (N)] -3. Viruses are obligate intracellular infectious agents that use the host cellular machinery to ensure their own fitness and survival. MicroRNAs (miRNA9) systems are potent post-transcriptional gene expression regulators that are important modulators of viral infections, and could play an important role in the treatment of viral infections. This review focuses to the genomic structure of coronaviruses, the functions of genomic proteins, the effects of micro RNA (miRNA) on virus replication and its pathogenesis.",neawc67w

The objective of this study was to compare the biomechanical properties of medial and anterolateral plating constructs used to stabilize simulated varus and valgus fracture patterns of the distal tibia. In 16 synthetic tibia models, a 45° oblique cut was made to model an Orthopedic Trauma Association type 43-A1.2 distal tibia fracture in either a varus or valgus injury pattern. Each fracture was then reduced and plated with a precontoured medial or anterolateral distal tibia plate. The specimens were biomechanically tested in axial and torsional loading, cyclic axial loading, and load to failure. For the varus fracture pattern, medial plating showed less fracture site displacement and rotation and was stiffer in both axial and torsional loading (P<.05). For the valgus fracture pattern, there was no statistically significant difference between medial and anterolateral plating. There were no significant differences between the 2 constructs for either fracture pattern with respect to ultimate load, displacement, or energy absorption in load to failure testing. When used to stabilize varus fracture patterns, medial plates showed superior biomechanical performance compared with anterolateral plates. In this application, the medial plates functioned in anti-glide mode. For valgus fracture patterns, no biomechanical differences between anterolateral and medial plating were observed. In clinical practice, surgeons should take this biomechanical evidence into account when devising a treatment strategy for fixation of distal tibia fractures.",cs5xe75l

Cardiovascular quality and outcomes,Hospital Variation in Functional Recovery After Stroke.," Functional status is a key patient-centric outcome, but there are little data on whether functional recovery post-stroke varies among hospitals. This study examined the distribution of functional status 3 months after stroke, determined whether these outcomes vary among hospitals, and identified hospital characteristics associated with better (or worse) functional outcomes. METHODS AND RESULTS Observational analysis of the AVAIL study (Adherence Evaluation After Ischemic Stroke-Longitudinal) included 2083 ischemic stroke patients enrolled from 82 US hospitals participating in Get With The Guidelines-Stroke and AVAIL. The primary outcome was dependence or death at 3 months (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score of 3-6). Secondary outcomes included functional dependence (mRS score of 3-5), disabled (mRS score of 2-5), and mRS evaluated as a continuous score. By 3 months post-discharge, 36.5% of patients were functionally dependent or dead. Rates of dependence or death varied widely by discharging hospitals (range: 0%-67%). After risk adjustment, patients had lower rates of 3-month dependence or death when treated at teaching hospitals (odds ratio, 0.72; 95% confidence interval, 0.54-0.96) and certified primary stroke centers (odds ratio, 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.53-0.91). In contrast, a composite measure of hospital-level adherence to acute stroke care performance metrics, stroke volume, and bed size was not associated with downstream patient functional status. Findings were robust across mRS end points and sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS One third of acute ischemic stroke patients were functionally dependent or dead 3 months postacute stroke; functional recovery rates varied considerably among hospitals, supporting the need to better determine which care processes can maximize functional outcomes.",0c94roq2

Effective treatment approaches to prevent the development of CPSP in this population have not been extensively investigated. The impact of multimodal strategies to prevent CPSP following elective mid/hindfoot surgery is unknown because of both the heterogeneity of acute pain management and the lack of a recognized definition particular to this surgery. This review aimed to identify and evaluate current pain management strategies after elective mid/hindfoot and ankle surgery. SOURCES Manual and electronic searches (MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library) were conducted of literature published between 1990 and July 2017. Comparative studies of adults undergoing elective mid/hindfoot and ankle surgery were included. Two reviewers independently reviewed studies and assessed their methodological quality. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS We found seven randomized-controlled trials meeting our inclusion criteria. Interventions focused on regional anesthesia techniques such as continuous popliteal sciatic and femoral nerve blockade. Participants were typically followed up to 48 hr postoperatively. Only one study assessed pain six months following elective mid/hindfoot and ankle surgery. CONCLUSION There is an overwhelming lack of evidence regarding CPSP and its management for patients undergoing elective mid/hindfoot and ankle surgery. The lack of a recognized and standard definition of CPSP after this group of surgeries precludes accurate and consistent evaluation.",uhkhb2bx

METHODS We retrospectively investigated 208 patients who underwent laparoscopic gastrectomy for gastric cancer between January 2007 and September 2014. After excluding 15 patients with unusual medical histories or surgical treatments, 193 were selected for this cohort study. We divided the patients into two cohorts: elderly patients (≥75 years old) and non-elderly patients (<74 years old). We compared these cohorts with respect to clinicopathological characteristics and intraoperative and postoperative parameters. RESULTS The overall complication rates were 11.4% (8 of 70 patients) in the elderly cohort and 8.1% (10 of 123 patients) in the non-elderly cohort (P = 0.449). In a univariate analysis, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) of ≥3, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score of 3, operative time of ≥330 min, and intraoperative blood loss of ≥50 ml were found to correlate significantly with postoperative complications. In a multivariate analysis, CCI of ≥3 (P = 0.034), ASA score of 3 (P = 0.019), and intraoperative blood loss of ≥50 ml (P = 0.016) were found to be independent risk factors of postoperative complications. In contrast, age was not found to significantly affect the risk of postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic gastrectomy for gastric cancer can be successfully performed in elderly patients with an acceptable complication rate. This study suggested that high CCI, ASA score, and intraoperative blood loss volume were identified as independent predictors of postoperative complications after laparoscopic gastrectomy for gastric cancer.",v6vcgd93

METHODS In our retrospective single-center analysis of 176 patients with carotid artery stenting between 2009 and 2015, using duplex ultrasound, we detected 9 patients with high-grade carotid artery in-stent restenosis. All restenosis patients were treated with a drug-eluting balloon (DEB) to prevent recurrent neointimal hyperplasia. One patient had bilateral carotid artery disease with bilateral in-stent restenosis, and 1 patient needed repeated DEB treatment 19 months after the first DEB intervention, so 11 DEB procedures, in total, were performed. RESULTS The median time-interval between primary carotid artery stenting and first DEB-treatment was 9 months. In 3 of the 11 interventions, the DEB treatment was assisted by an additional stent. One repeat DEB treatment was necessary, and three DEB treatments were followed by a secondary stent. No peri-interventional complications (TIA, stroke, or death) were observed during or after DEB intervention. Therefore, in the entire group, the 1y event-free survival (EFS) was 100%, and the 2y/3y/5y EFS was 83%. CONCLUSION DEB intervention seems to be an effective and safe treatment for patients with high-grade in-stent restenosis after SPAC.",jstn2dqp

We found that work rates were unachievable (ie, exceeded 1 hour of scheduled work per hour of available labor) for 75% of scheduled due times, despite presumed achievable average work load. OBJECTIVE To determine the optimal strategy for creating work assignments based on work rate. METHODS A focus group used root-cause analysis to identify ways to balance assignments based on work rate. We surveyed employees to assess their willingness to start earlier. We determined the ratio of scheduled to unscheduled work during a 12-month period. The scheduled work comprised administering small-volume nebulizer, metered-dose inhaler, noninvasive ventilation, and mechanical ventilation. The unscheduled work consisted of all other modalities. We also developed a spreadsheet model to assess the effect of shifting the start time on work-rate distribution in a representative 24-hour period. RESULTS The focus group determined that starting treatments 1 hour earlier would help. Fifteen of the 24 clinicians surveyed responded, and 13 of the respondents were willing to start earlier. The scheduled work load averaged approximately 55% of the total work load, but there was high variability per assignment area (range 0-99%). The spreadsheet model showed that shifting treatment start times improved the distribution of work rate throughout the day, but did not guarantee that labor demand never outstrips supply. CONCLUSIONS Our studies to date suggest that: basing assignments on average work load leads to periods of unachievable work rate, resulting in missed treatments and staff dissatisfaction. We have only limited ability to reduce peaks in work rate, but staggering treatment times is effective. Fair assignment of work should differentiate scheduled from unscheduled work.",iyuhgb1d

However, concerns exist over potential overcooling of hyperthermic individuals during cold-water immersion. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the recommendation that removing previously hyperthermic individuals from a cold-water bath at a rectal temperature (T(re)) of 38.6°C would attenuate overcooling. DESIGN Controlled laboratory study. SETTING University research laboratory. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS Participants included 6 men and 4 women (age = 22 ± 3 years, height = 172 ± 10 cm, mass = 67.8 ± 10.7 kg, body fat percentage = 17.1% ± 4.5%, maximum oxygen consumption = 59.3 ± 8.7 mL·kg(-1)·min(-1)). INTERVENTION(S) After exercising at an ambient temperature of 40.0°C for 38.5 ± 9.4 minutes, until T(re) reached 39.5°C, participants were immersed in a 2.0°C circulated water bath until T(re) decreased to either 37.5°C or 38.6°C. Subsequently, participants were removed from the water bath and recovered for 20 minutes at an ambient temperature of 25°C. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) Rectal and esophageal temperatures were measured continuously during the immersion and recovery periods. RESULTS Because of the experimental design, the overall time of immersion was greater during the 37.5°C trial (16.6 ± 5.7 minutes) than the 38.6°C trial (8.8 ± 2.6 minutes) (t(9) = -4.740, P = .001). During the recovery period after cold-water immersion, both rectal (F(1,9) = 50.540, P < .001) and esophageal (F(1,6) = 20.365, P = .007) temperatures remained greater in the 38.6°C trial than in the 37.5°C trial. This was evidenced by low points of 36.47°C ± 0.70°C and 37.19°C ± 0.71°C for rectal temperature (t(9) = 2.975, P = .016) and of 35.67°C ± 1.27°C and 36.72°C ± 0.95°C for esophageal temperature (t(6) = 3.963, P = .007) during the recovery period of the 37.5°C and 38.6°C trials, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Immersion for approximately 9 minutes to a rectal temperature cooling limit of 38.6°C negated any risk associated with overcooling hyperthermic individuals when they were immersed in 2°C water.",h9zgi99c

Ricin is considered to be a major bio-threat as it can be freely and easily acquired in large quantities. A deliberate release of such toxin in civilian populations would very likely overwhelm existing public health systems, resulting in public fear and social unrest. There is currently no commercially available or FDA-approved prophylaxis such as vaccines, or therapeutic antitoxins or antidotes, available for ricin intoxication. Patient treatment is typically supportive care based on symptoms, often designed to reinforce the body's natural response. This paper describes the development and validation of a robust ELISA test kit, which can be used to screen for ricin in biological specimens such as whole blood and faeces. Faecal specimens are shown in this study to have better diagnostic sensitivity and a wider diagnostic window compared to whole blood. From these results, it is concluded that faeces is the most suitable clinical specimen for diagnosis of ricin poisoning via the oral route. The ELISA test kit can also detect ricin in environmental samples. An advantage of this ELISA kit over other commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) detection kits currently on the market that are developed to screen environmental samples only is its ability to diagnose ricin poisoning from clinical specimens as well as detect ricin from environmental samples.",izd29iao

Two groups of participants were included: malaria-negative acute febrile illness (AFI) patients, called febrilers, at three clinics (n = 74) and second, farmers, herders, and veterinary staff found at five government cattle dip-tanks, called dip-tanksters (n = 64). Blood samples were tested using one PCR (Bartonella spp.) and eight antibody-ELISAs, and questionnaires were conducted to assess risk factors. Seventy-seven percent of febrilers and 98% of dip-tanksters had at least one positive test. Bartonella spp. (PCR 9.5%), spotted fever group (SFG) Rickettsia spp. (IgM 24.1%), Coxiella burnetii. (IgM 2.3%), and Leptospira spp. (IgM 6.8%) were present in febrilers and could have been the cause of their fever. Dip-tanksters and febrilers had evidence of past infection to Rickettsia spp. (IgG 92.2% and 63.4%, respectively) and C. burnetii (IgG 60.9% and 37.8%, respectively). No Brucella infection or current Bartonella infection was found in the dip-tanksters, although they had higher levels of recent exposure to Leptospira spp. (IgM 21.9%) compared to the febrilers. Low levels of West Nile and Sindbis, and no Rift Valley fever virus exposure were found in either groups. The only risk factor found to be significant was attending dip-tanks in febrilers for Q fever (p = 0.007). Amoxicillin is the local standard treatment for AFI, but would not be effective for Bartonella spp. infections, SFG rickettsiosis, Q fever infections, or the viral infections. There is a need to revise AFI treatment algorithms, educate medical and veterinary staff about these pathogens, especially SFG rickettsiosis and Q fever, support disease surveillance systems, and inform the population about reducing tick and surface water contact.",14fktd12

Parents, teachers and healthcare providers are also increasingly using such interventions with children. This review examines the use of meditation-based interventions in the treatment of children with Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Electronic databases searched included PsycINFO, Medline, CINAHL, and AMED. Inclusion criteria involved children (aged to 18 years) diagnosed with ADHD, delivery of a meditation-based intervention to children and/or parents, and publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Studies were identified and coded using standard criteria, risk of bias was assessed using Risk of Bias in Non-randomised Studies- of interventions (ROBINS-I), and effect sizes were calculated. A total of 16 studies were identified (8 that included children in treatment, and 8 that included combined parent-child treatment). Results indicated that risk of bias was high across studies. At this stage, no definitive conclusions can be offered regarding the utility of meditation-based interventions for children with ADHD and/or their parents, since the methodological quality of the studies reviewed is low. Future well designed research is needed to establish the efficacy of meditation-based interventions, including commonly used practices such as mindfulness, before recommendations can be made for children with ADHD and their families.",pihbua2c

Dr. Rudolf Nissen was one of the outstanding surgeons who had served in the Turkish university hospitals. He had created an antireflux procedure which is named after his own name while he was working in our clinic, the Cerrahpaşa Hospital. From a laparoscopic approach, the Nissen fundoplication was the gold standard intervention for the surgical treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Currently, video laparoscopic surgery is evolving quickly with the guidance of new technology. Single-port (SP) laparoscopic transumbilical surgery is one of the newest branches of advanced laparoscopy. DISCUSSION Simple or complex manipulations may be performed with SP laparoscopic transumbilical surgery. The advantages, which are gained from conventional laparoscopy, can be invigorated by an SP laparoscopic approach. The retraction technique of the liver and the optical system were the most important factors, which made the Nissen fundoplication possible via single port. Here, we report that totally laparoscopic transumbilical SP Nissen fundoplication procedure was performed in three patients for sliding hiatal hernia with GERD. CONCLUSION Totally laparoscopic transumbilical SP Nissen fundoplication is a safe and feasible technique for the surgical treatment of GERD.",16jebg1u

The Baltic View.,"Background The novel surgical procedure transanal total mesorectal excision (taTME) has rapidly become an interest of research in order to overcome the shortcomings of laparoscopic surgery in the treatment of middle and low rectal cancer. taTME is a new natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery modality combining three rectal surgery techniques. Methods A retrospective clinical study was conducted in a single centre for a period of 3 years, and herein we report on our first 25 taTME procedures in patients with middle and lower third rectal adenocarcinoma. Results The main demographics were evaluated. The mean age of patients was 64 ± 12 years. There were predominantly males (72%) and 7 female patients (28%) with an average body mass index of 29 ± 4.8 kg/m2. High blood pressure, obesity, chronic heart insufficiency, chronic atrial fibrillation, and diabetes mellitus were commonly diagnosed in all patients. A circumferential resection margin >1 mm was achieved in 16% (n = 4), >2 mm in 40% (n = 10), and >3 mm in 44% (n = 11) of operated patients. The average CRM was 1.8 ± 0.9 cm. In 24% of cases, the distance of a tumour from the mesorectal fascia (MRF) was <1 mm; meanwhile, for 76% of patients, the tumour margin was >1 mm from the MRF. Recovery to flatus was 3 ± 1 days. The average length of hospital stay was 11 ± 3 days. The overall postoperative morbidity was 8%, i.e. one (4%) complication classified as Clavien-Dindo degree I and one (4%) major (IIIb) complication. Subsequently, all patients successfully recovered and were discharged from hospital. During the follow-up period no cancer recurrence was observed. Conclusion Our results nicely demonstrate that taTME can be safely performed with acceptable perioperative complications in patients with middle or lower third rectal cancer. In addition, the perioperative morbidity is also acceptable. However, taTME remains a technically highly demanding operation but is feasible and safe after the appropriate experience is gained. Nevertheless, larger multi-centre prospective randomised studies are ongoing to confirm the safety and to verify oncological results when compared to laparoscopic rectal surgery.",aj1j92xl

Recently, local immunomodulation garnered interests as a way to improve the immune response. We were interested in improving the RFA immune response priming to propose a curative treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC) based on antitumor immunity. First, we demonstrated that the RFA did not increase the tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in secondary distant tumors of patients and in mice model and could not avoid relapse. Remarkably, RFA and in situ immunomodulation with GM-CSF-BCG hydrogel induced complete cure of microscopic secondary lesions in mice, related to a strong specific immune response. Then, we demonstrated that the immune escape of large secondary lesions was reversed by addition of the systemic PD-1 blockade to the in situ immunomodulation. The lack of an effective distant immune response in patients treated with RFA confirmed the relevance of this new combination strategy. Increasing the in situ priming response of radiofrequency ablation provides effective adjuvants to induce an abscopal effect. In the case of large lesions, synergy between PD1 blockade inhibitor, ineffective alone or after single RFA, with in situ immunomodulation, could lead to reconsideration of the use of checkpoint inhibition in metastatic MSS CRC.",mxmdvjy7

Anorectal manometry (ARM) and colonic transit testing have allowed classification of subtypes of constipation, raising promise of targeted treatments. There has been limited study of the correlation between physiological parameters and healthcare utilization. METHODS All patients undergoing ARM and colonic transit testing for chronic constipation at two tertiary care centers from 2000 to 2014 were included in this retrospective study. Our primary outcomes included number of constipation-related and gastroenterology visits per year. Multivariate linear regression adjusting for confounders defined independent effect of measures of colonic and anorectal function on healthcare utilization. KEY RESULTS Our study included 612 patients with chronic constipation. More than 50% (n = 333) of patients had outlet obstruction by means of balloon expulsion testing and 43.5% (n = 266) had slow colonic transit. On unadjusted analysis, outlet obstruction (1.98 vs 1.68), slow transit (2.40 vs 2.07) and high resting anal pressure (2.16 vs 1.76) were all associated with greater constipation-related visits/year compared to patients without each of those parameters (p < 0.05 for all). Outlet obstruction and high resting anal pressure were also associated with greater number of gastroenterology visits/year. After multivariate adjustment, high resting anal pressure was the only independent predictor of increased constipation-related visits/year (p = 0.02) and gastroenterology visits/year (p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES Among patients with chronic constipation, high resting anal pressure, rather than outlet obstruction or slow transit, predicts healthcare resource utilization.",lzxweepn

It is anticipated that rationing of health care resources will be required, thus demanding that choices be made about which individuals should receive potentially life-saving care when not all who can be saved can be served. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION Most proposed triage and allocation plans have used medical inclusion and exclusion criteria to reduce this gap, but there will still be many more patients than resources. Thus, the potential to arbitrarily exclude groups of people on non-medical grounds in order to reduce relative scarcity could offer an attractive option. Can societies make reasoned anticipatory decisions to keep certain people from receiving influenza treatment in order to maximize the availability of care for other, more favored groups? RESULTS In this paper, we argue that taking the fundamental moral equality of people seriously requires the inclusion of vulnerable, socially marginalized groups (such as illegal immigrants and incarcerated prisoners) in planning for a pandemic. While there may be a majoritarian justification for a priori discrimination against some groups of people on non-medical grounds, there are no morally defensible reasons to do so and many reasons not to engage in such behavior. CONCLUSIONS Pandemic planners should resist attempts to institute either unsanctioned or authorized discrimination in resource allocation. Because of their unique position in society, their ethical code and their essential role in confronting a pandemic, physicians can (and should) defend egalitarianism in the allocation of health care resources in such a public health crisis and advocate and act against such exclusion were it to occur.",efyctlss

Patients' medications were noted before and after the procedure. Following the injection, patients were followed over time and outcome was assessed. Patients experienced rapid and long-lasting pain relief allowing for significant reduction in antineuralgia medications. This was done with the objective of breaking the pain cycle with subsequent discontinuation or reduction of analgesic medications. CONCLUSION This technique may be an effective treatment for medication-refractory V2 TN. By interrupting the pain cycle, this renders the condition amenable to long-term control using diminished doses of standard antineuralgia pharmaceuticals. The practical implications of the described procedure are that it is simple, safe, and well-tolerated with few or no adverse effects.

Open partial nephrectomy is the standard operative technique. The use of minimally-invasive strategies such as laparoscopic, robot-assisted partial nephrectomy or laparoendoscopic single site (LESS) partial nephrectomy has increased in recent years. PATIENTS/MATERIAL AND METHODS In this retrospective study, patients undergoing laparoscopic partial nephrectomy between December 2008 and November 2013 were evaluated. All patients presented with renal lesions suspicious for malignancy. Operations were performed as conventional laparoscopic transperitoneal partial nephrectomies (cLPN) or LESS partial nephrectomies (LESS-PN) in SITUS technique (single incision transumbilical surgery). The aim of the study was to compare perioperative outcome parameters such as duration of surgery, time of ischaemia, complications, need for transfusion, conversion rates, changes in renal function and duration of hospital stay in both groups. RESULTS A total of 85 laparoscopic partial nephrectomies were performed in this study (72 cLPN and 13 LESS-PN). The average tumour size was 2.68±1.47 cm (cLPN) vs. 2.46±1.11 cm (LESS-PN). The mean duration of surgery was 175.17±50.026 min (cLPN) and 185.77±35.991 min (LESS-PN). 45 (62.5%) operations (cLPN) vs. 10 (76.9%) (LESS-PN) were performed in zero-ischaemia technique. There were no significant differences in perioperative outcome parameters between both groups. Postoperative complication rates (Clavien-Dindo≥3) were 11.1% (cLPN) vs. 7.7% (LESS-PN).

The Saudi Arabian authority successfully organized the Hajj 2009 amidst fear of pandemic influenza. While severe influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was rare, the true burden of pandemic influenza at Hajj that year remains speculative. In this article we review the latest evidence on influenza control and discuss our experience of influenza and its prevention at Hajj and possible application to other mass gatherings. Depending on study design the attack rate of seasonal influenza at Hajj has ranged from 6% in polymerase chain reaction or culture confirmed studies to 38% in serological surveillance. No significant effect of influenza vaccine or the use of personal protective measures against influenza has been established from observational studies, although the uptake of the vaccine and adherence to face masks and hand hygiene has been low. In all, there is a relatively poor evidence base for control of influenza. Until better evidence is obtained, vaccination coupled with rapid antiviral treatment of symptomatic individuals remains the mainstay of prevention at Hajj and other mass gatherings. Hajj pilgrimage provides a unique opportunity to test the effectiveness of various preventive measures that require a large sample size, such as testing the efficacy of plain surgical masks against laboratory-confirmed influenza. After successful completion of a pilot trial conducted among Australian pilgrims at the 2011 Hajj, a large multinational cluster randomized controlled trial is being planned. This will require effective international collaboration.",k3hfoncf

Typically, it affects elderly, immunocompromised population. We report an unusual case of an immunocompetent young adult presenting with occipital headache and zoster rash, without preherpetic and postherpetic neuralgia, who was diagnosed with varicella meningitis on Polymerase chain reaction (PCR). He was treated with intravenous acyclovir and later discharged on famciclovir. Diagnosis of varicella meningitis is difficult in the absence of typical features of zoster rash and requires high index of suspicion.

METHODS We randomly assigned eligible patients who had received intravenous t-PA within 3 hours after symptom onset to receive additional endovascular therapy or intravenous t-PA alone, in a 2:1 ratio. The primary outcome measure was a modified Rankin scale score of 2 or less (indicating functional independence) at 90 days (scores range from 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating greater disability). RESULTS The study was stopped early because of futility after 656 participants had undergone randomization (434 patients to endovascular therapy and 222 to intravenous t-PA alone). The proportion of participants with a modified Rankin score of 2 or less at 90 days did not differ significantly according to treatment (40.8% with endovascular therapy and 38.7% with intravenous t-PA; absolute adjusted difference, 1.5 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], -6.1 to 9.1, with adjustment for the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] score [8-19, indicating moderately severe stroke, or ≥20, indicating severe stroke]), nor were there significant differences for the predefined subgroups of patients with an NIHSS score of 20 or higher (6.8 percentage points; 95% CI, -4.4 to 18.1) and those with a score of 19 or lower (-1.0 percentage point; 95% CI, -10.8 to 8.8). Findings in the endovascular-therapy and intravenous t-PA groups were similar for mortality at 90 days (19.1% and 21.6%, respectively; P=0.52) and the proportion of patients with symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage within 30 hours after initiation of t-PA (6.2% and 5.9%, respectively; P=0.83). CONCLUSIONS The trial showed similar safety outcomes and no significant difference in functional independence with endovascular therapy after intravenous t-PA, as compared with intravenous t-PA alone.

We sought to determine if hernia-related factors, such as defect size and re-operative status correlate with postoperative complications, operative times and length of stay (LOS). METHODS The study is a retrospective review of 30-day perioperative outcomes following LVHR in 91 patients who underwent surgery at a single institution from August 2009 through June 2012. A single surgeon performed all procedures. RESULTS Indications for surgery were recurrent incisional hernia in 33 % of patients and primary incisional or ventral abdominal hernias in the rest. Coated polyester mesh with an average size of 348 cm(2) (±214; range 113-1,036) was used. Mean operative time was 132 min (±66.1; range 53-412). The mean LOS was 4.0 days (±3.5; range 1-22). Complications occurred in 13 patients for overall morbidity of 16.5 % and no mortality. There was one recurrence in 30 days (1.1 %). Patients who had a surgery >120 min or a LOS >1 day were statistically more likely to have multiple hernias, larger defect sizes (>40 cm(2)), larger mesh sizes (>300 cm(2)) or a history of recurrent hernia (P < 0.05). No other clinical or demographic variable evaluated in this study correlated with operative time or LOS. CONCLUSIONS LVHR is safe with a low incidence of perioperative complications. Patients with multiple, larger and recurrent hernias have longer operative times and LOS. This information can be used to guide preoperative planning for the patient, surgeon and treating institution.",v4xejy0t

METHODS From January 2017 the study planned to enroll 100 patients with acute ischemic stroke who were treated with the Revive SE as a first pass. The study primary outcomes were rates of favorable reperfusion using the modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction score [mTICI] 2b/3 and rates of favorable outcome with the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) ≤2 at 3 months. The secondary outcomes were time interval from puncture to vascular reperfusion, number of passes by Revive SE stent-retriever, incidence of distal embolization and into new territories and rate of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (SICH) within 24 h post intervention. RESULTS A total of 100 treated patients (mean age: 65.6 ± 11.3 years) were enrolled. The median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale before the procedure was 16. Target vessel occlusions were as follows: middle cerebral artery (MCA) M1 in 48, M2 in 6, anterior cerebral artery (ACA) in 3, internal carotid artery (ICA) in 22, basilar artery (BA) in 17, and vertebral artery (VA) in 4. Reperfusion rate with Revive SE without rescue devices was 69%. Reperfusion rate with Revive SE only was 83.3% in MCA M2, followed by 82.4% in BA. Thromboembolic complications and SICH developed in 10% and 2% of patients, respectively. Overall, a satisfactory reperfusion was achieved in 92% and a favorable outcome at 90 days in 48%.

To date, no other studies have compared the LESS and conventional laparoscopic TEP approaches for the treatment of inguinal hernia in a prospective randomized study setting. METHODS For this study, 100 patients undergoing inguinal hernia repair were prospectively randomized into either the LESS TEP group or the conventional laparoscopic TEP group. Pre-, intra-, and postoperative factors were recorded. The primary end point was postoperative pain. The patients were interviewed at outpatient clinics at 1 week, 3 months, and 6 months postoperatively. RESULTS The demographic data were comparable between the two groups. The median operative time was longer in the LESS TEP group (63.5 min) than in the conventional TEP group (50.5 min) (p = 0.001). No conversion was performed in either group. The mean pain score 2 h postoperatively during rest was significantly higher in the conventional TEP group than in the LESS TEP group (3.9 vs. 2.6; p = 0.02). The postoperative results were comparable between the groups in terms of analgesic requirements, systemic stress responses, complications, and postoperative convalescence. CONCLUSIONS The LESS TEP technique is associated with a longer operative time but offers the minor benefit of a reduction in immediate postoperative pain.",he3kkgf9

DESIGN A retrospective descriptive study (Canadian Task Force classification III). SETTING Multiple academic teaching hospitals. PATIENTS Women with Fédération Internationale de Gynécologie et d'Obstétrique FIGO stage IA1 to IB1 cervical cancer. INTERVENTIONS LESS-RH as the primary therapy for cervical cancer performed by a gynecologic oncologist with expertise in LESS. A multichannel, single-port access device; a flexible-tipped 5-mm laparoscope; and a multifunctional instrument were used in all cases. Clinicopathologic, surgical, and perioperative outcomes were analyzed. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Twenty-two women were identified in whom a LESS-RH was attempted; 20 (91%) successfully underwent the procedure, including 19 in whom pelvic lymphadenectomy (PLND) was completed. Of the 2 converted procedures, 1 patient underwent 2-port laparoscopy secondary to truncal obesity, and 1 patient underwent conversion to laparotomy secondary to external iliac vein laceration during PLND. The median age and body mass index were 46 years and 23.3 kg/m(2), respectively. The median number of pelvic lymph nodes removed was 22. One patient experienced an intraoperative complication, and no patient required reoperation. The margins of excision were negative. One patient with 2 positive pelvic nodes and 1 patient with microscopic parametrial disease received adjuvant chemosensitized radiation; 3 additional patients received adjuvant radiation therapy secondary to an intermediate risk for recurrence. After a median follow up of 11 months, no recurrences were detected. CONCLUSION LESS-RH/PLND is feasible and safe for select patients with stage I cervical cancer. Larger studies are needed to confirm whether the increased technical difficulty of this procedure justifies its use in routine gynecologic oncology practice.",3iud19dy

METHODS Sixty Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 6 groups according to a random number table: control group, model group, high-, medium- and low-dose BXD groups (9.2, 4.6 and 1.8 g/(kg·d), respectively), and domperidone group (10 mg/(kg·d)), 10 rats per group. DGP model was established initially by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ), and was confirmed by recording gastric emptying, intestinal transport velocity and gastric myoelectric activity of rats after 2 months. Each group was treated with a corresponding drug for 4 weeks. The mRNA and protein expressions of phospholipase C (PLC), inositol triphosphate (IP3), neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) dependent protein kinase G (PKG) were detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot, respectively, while nitric oxide (NO) and cGMP expressions were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Gastric tissues were obtained from rats for primary cell culture preparation. Gastric SM cells were treated with 0.8 µmol/L of STZ or STZ plus 1,000, 500 and 200 µg/mL of BXD or STZ plus 2.5 µmol/mL of domperidone for 24, 48, 72 or 96 h, respectively. The length of gastric SM cells and intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) before and after BXD treatment was measured. RESULTS Compared with the model group, high- and medium-dose BXD and domperidone significantly increased the expressions of PLC, IP3, NO, nNOS, cGMP and PKG in rat's gastric tissue (P<0.01). Gastric SM cells treated with BXD showed a time- and dose-dependent increase in cell viability (P<0.01). The treatment with high- and medium-dose BXD and domperidone inhibited the increase in gastric SM cells length and increased [Ca2+]i compared with the model cells (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS Treatment with high- and medium-dose BXD significantly attenuated STZ-induced experimental DGP in rats. The therapeutic effect of BXD on DGP rats might be associated with the PLC-IP3-Ca2+/NO-cGMP-PKG signal pathway.",obdqkbtw

We describe a technique for treating symptomatic patients, aimed at obtaining remission of symptoms and avoiding recurrences. METHODS After excisional haemorrhoidectomy, a transverse incision is performed on the proximal part of the mucocutaneous bridge, above the plane of the internal sphincter. A flap of anal mucosa is gently raised. Haemorrhoidal tissue is not removed. LigaSure™ may be useful in focussing coagulation and reducing heat diffusion. Denudation of the internal sphincter allows the removal of potential retained staples. Then, stitches are placed between the proximal part of the flap and the proximal divided edge of the rectal mucosa. Excessive devascularisation of the flap must be avoided. RESULTS From January 2007 to January 2011, we treated 11 patients. The procedures lasted a mean of 38.2 ± 11.1 min. One patient (9 %) suffered from bleeding during the night before being discharged, but this did not require surgery, and another (9 %) had urinary retention. No other perioperative complications were observed. The mean visual analogue scale score 1 day and 1 week after surgery was 4.7 ± 1.3 and 2.3 ± 0.5, respectively. At mean follow-up of 4 ± 1.8 years, neither symptomatic nor asymptomatic recurrences have been observed. Two out of three patients presenting with urgency reported regression of symptoms (66.7 %). In all patients suffering from pain after stapled haemorrhoidopexy, the procedure achieved pain relief (2/2, 100 %). No stenoses occurred. CONCLUSIONS This technique is a promising alternative after failed stapled haemorrhoidopexy. Morbidity is low. The procedure may effectively treat associated symptoms.",9trzogg6

However, the compound is short-acting, and there is no extended-release formulation clinically available. A previous hydromorphone extended-release formulation that successfully came to market was subsequently withdrawn on account of safety concerns. Clinical need supports the presence of an extended-release formulation of hydromorphone. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW Medline articles showing from a search of 'hydromorphone and OROS' were included in the review. In addition, searches were done relating to published data regarding regulatory affairs dealing with this specific topic. Physicians prescribing information for hydromorphone was also reviewed.

Varicella zoster infection is almost universally prevalent, making prevention of acute herpes zoster (AHZ) infection and prompt diagnosis and aggressive management of PHN of critical importance. Despite the recent development of a herpes zoster vaccine, prevention of AHZ is not yet widespread or discussed in PHN treatment guidelines. Diagnosis of PHN requires consideration of recognized PHN signs and known risk factors, including advanced age, severe prodromal pain, severe rash, and AHZ location on the trigeminal dermatomes or brachial plexus. PHN pain is typically localized, unilateral and chronic, but may be constant, intermittent, spontaneous and/or evoked. PHN is likely to interfere with sleep and daily activities. First-line therapies for PHN include tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentin and pregabalin, and the lidocaine 5 % patch. Second-line therapies include strong and weak opioids and topical capsaicin cream or 8 % patch. Tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentinoids and strong opioids are effective but are also associated with systemic adverse events that may limit their use in many patients, most notably those with significant medical comorbidities or advanced age. Of the topical therapies, the topical lidocaine 5 % patch has proven more effective than capsaicin cream or 8 % patch and has a more rapid onset of action than the other first-line therapies or capsaicin. Given the low systemic drug exposure, adverse events with topical therapies are generally limited to application-site reactions, which are typically mild and transient with lidocaine 5 % patch, but may involve treatment-limiting discomfort with capsaicin cream or 8 % patch. Based on available clinical data, clinicians should consider administering the herpes zoster vaccine to all patients aged 60 years and older. Clinicians treating patients with PHN may consider a trial of lidocaine 5 % patch monotherapy before resorting to a systemic therapy, or alternatively, may consider administering the lidocaine 5 % patch in combination with a tricyclic antidepressant or a gabapentinoid to provide more rapid analgesic response and lower the dose requirement of systemic therapies.",dji4st0c

MATERIALS AND METHODS From 2009 to 2016, data were prospectively collected for patients who underwent ch-EVAR using long PGs. Data included patient demographics and aortic anatomy, technical success, patency and reintervention rate. RESULTS A total of 29 long PGs were placed in 18 patients (males 16, average age 71 years). Nine (50%) suffered from thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms, 4 (22%) from juxtarenal aortic aneurysms and 3 (17%) from suprarenal aortic aneurysms and 2 (11%) were treated for abdominal aortic aneurysms that required revascularization of a pelvic kidney. Twenty (70%) of the PGs were 100 mm in length, and 9 (30%) were 150 mm. Long PGs were successfully placed in 16 (89%) patients. Two patients (11%) expired in the perioperative period. Mean period of follow-up was 12 months (range 1-43 months). Sac size decreased in size or remained unchanged in 13 patients (72%). Three patients with sac enlargement underwent successful endovascular treatment the type 1A gutter endoleaks. None required reintervention of the PGs. Three patients expired, none from aneurysm-related deaths. CONCLUSION The use of long PGs is a feasible technique and provides a durable repair of complex aortic aneurysms in midterm follow-up. Despite the length of the PGs, gutter endoleaks are encountered only in a minority of the cases and can be treated minimally invasive techniques.",p07uggpq

Although recent studies have revealed the ability of these stem cells in multipotential attribute, their efficiency of hepatic lineage differentiation has not been addressed so far. The aim of this study is to investigate hepatic lineage fate competence of periodontal ligament stem cells through direct media induction. Differentiation of periodontal ligament stem cells into hepatocyte-like cells was conducted by the exposure of two phase media induction. First phase was performed in the presence of hepatocyte growth factors to induce a definitive endoderm formation. In the subsequent phase, the cells were treated with oncostatin M and dexamethosone followed by insulin and transferrin to generate hepatocyte-like cells. Hepatic-related characters of the generated hepatocyte-like cells were determined at both mRNA and protein level followed by functional assays. Foremost changes observed in the generation of hepatocyte-like cells were the morphological features in which these cells were transformed from fibroblastic shape to polygonal shape. Temporal expression of hepatic markers ranging from early endodermal up to late markers were detected in the hepatocyte-like cells. Crucial hepatic markers such as glycogen storage, albumin, and urea secretion were also shown. These findings exhibited the ability of periodontal ligament stem cells of dental origin to be directed into hepatic lineage fate. These cells can be regarded as an alternative autologous source in the usage of stem cell-based treatment for liver diseases.",h728rjnn

The use of opioids has been associated with noninfectious inflammatory masses at the tip of the intrathecal catheter, which can result in neurologic complications. METHODS The Polyanalgesic Consensus Conference is a meeting of a group of well-published and experienced practitioners; the purpose of the meeting is to update the standard of care for intrathecal therapies to reflect current knowledge gleaned from literature and clinical experience. An exhaustive literature search was performed, and information from this search was provided to panel members. Analysis of the published literature was coupled with the clinical experience of panel participants to form recommendations regarding intrathecal inflammatory masses or granulomas. RESULTS The panel has made recommendations for the prevention, diagnosis, and management of intrathecal granulomas. CONCLUSION The use of chronic infusions of intrathecal opioids is associated with the formation of inflammatory masses at the intrathecal catheter tip in a small minority of treated patients. Nonetheless, the appearance of these space-occupying lesions can lead to devastating neurologic sequelae. The prevention, early detection, and successful treatment of intraspinal granulomas are important considerations when offering intrathecal drug therapy to patients with chronic intractable pain.",i9m4agln

DESIGN Multicenter retrospective cohort study SETTING:: One Level 1 Trauma Center and one orthopaedic specialty hospital in New York CityPatients/Participants: Fifty-nine consecutive patients (average age 85, range: 65 - 100 years) treated for a hip fracture (OTA/AO 31, 32.1) over a 5-week period, March 20, 2020 to April 24, 2020, during the height of the COVID-19 crisis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS COVID-19 infection status was used to stratify patients. The primary outcome was inpatient mortality. Secondary outcomes were admission to the intensive care unit, unexpected intubation, pneumonia, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, urinary tract infection, and transfusion. Baseline demographics, comorbidities, treatment characteristics, and COVID-related symptomatology were also evaluated. RESULTS Ten patients (15%) tested positive for COVID-19 (COVID+) (n=9; 7 preoperatively, 2 postoperatively) or were presumed positive (n=1), 40 (68%) patients tested negative, and 9 (15%) patients were not tested in the primary hospitalization. American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) scores were higher in the COVID+ group (d=-0.83; p=0.04); however, the Charlson Comorbidity Index was similar between the study groups (d=-0.17; p=0.63). Inpatient mortality was significantly increased in the COVID+ cohort (56% vs. 4%; OR 30.0, 95% CI 4.3-207; p=0.001). Including the one presumed positive case in the COVID+ cohort increased this difference (60% vs. 2%; OR 72.0, 95% CI 7.9-754; p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS Hip fracture patients with concomitant COVID-19 infection had worse ASA scores but similar baseline comorbidities with significantly higher rates of inpatient mortality compared to those without concomitant COVID-19 infection.

It examined potential treatment targets for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) to be used for a ""treat-to-target"" clinical management strategy using an evidence-based expert consensus process. METHODS A Steering Committee of 28 IBD specialists developed recommendations based on a systematic literature review and expert opinion. Consensus was gained if ≥75% of participants scored the recommendation as 7-10 on a 10-point rating scale (where 10=agree completely). RESULTS The group agreed upon 12 recommendations for ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). The agreed target for UC was clinical/patient-reported outcome (PRO) remission (defined as resolution of rectal bleeding and diarrhea/altered bowel habit) and endoscopic remission (defined as a Mayo endoscopic subscore of 0-1). Histological remission was considered as an adjunctive goal. Clinical/PRO remission was also agreed upon as a target for CD and defined as resolution of abdominal pain and diarrhea/altered bowel habit; and endoscopic remission, defined as resolution of ulceration at ileocolonoscopy, or resolution of findings of inflammation on cross-sectional imaging in patients who cannot be adequately assessed with ileocolonoscopy. Biomarker remission (normal C-reactive protein (CRP) and calprotectin) was considered as an adjunctive target. CONCLUSIONS Evidence- and consensus-based recommendations for selecting the goals for treat-to-target strategies in patients with IBD are made available. Prospective studies are needed to determine how these targets will change disease course and patients' quality of life.",8tarro2y

Adjuvant S-1 has been shown to be non-inferior to uracil and tegafur plus leucovorin in terms of disease-free survival. This study aims to confirm the non-inferiority of S-1 compared with capecitabine as adjuvant treatment in patients with stage III colorectal cancer. METHODS This study was an open-label, non-inferiority, randomised, phase 3, multicentre trial done in 56 Japanese centres to assess the non-inferiority of S-1 to capecitabine as adjuvant chemotherapy. Eligible patients were aged 20-80 years with stage III colorectal adenocarcinoma, as defined by the presence of an inferior margin of the primary tumour above the peritoneal reflection; R0 resection; and colectomy with D3 or D2 lymph node dissection. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive eight courses of capecitabine (1250 mg/m2 orally twice daily, days 1-14, every 21 days) or four courses of S-1 (40 mg/m2 orally twice daily, days 1-28, every 42 days). Randomisation was done via phone call, fax, or web-based systems to the Japan Clinical Oncology Group Data Center and used a minimisation method with a random component adjusted by institution, tumour location (colon vs rectosigmoid and upper rectum), number of positive lymph node metastases (≤3 vs ≥4), and surgical technique (conventional vs non-touch isolation). The primary endpoint was disease-free survival with a non-inferiority margin for the hazard ratio (HR) set at 1·24, analysed by intention to treat. This trial was registered with UMIN Clinical Trial Registry, number UMIN000003272. FINDINGS Between March 1, 2010, and Aug 23, 2013, 1564 patients were randomly assigned to capecitabine (n=782) or S-1 (n=782), all of whom were included in the efficacy analysis; 777 patients in the capecitabine group and 768 in the S-1 group were included in the safety analysis. At the prespecified second interim analysis after final accrual, 258 (48%) of 535 required events were reported, and the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee recommended early publication because S-1 could not show non-inferiority compared with capecitabine for disease-free survival. With a median follow-up of 23·7 months (IQR 14·1-35·2), 3-year disease-free survival was 82·0% (95% CI 78·5-85·0) for the capecitabine group and 77·9% (74·1-81·1) for the S-1 group (HR 1·23, 99·05% CI 0·89-1·70; one-sided pnon-inferiority=0·46). The most frequent grade 3 or higher adverse events in the capecitabine group were hand-foot skin reactions (123 [16%] of 777 patients), and in the S-1 group were diarrhoea (64 [8%] of 768 patients) and neutropenia (61 [8%]). There was one (<1%) treatment-related death in each group. INTERPRETATION Adjuvant capecitabine remains one of the standard treatments for stage III colorectal cancer in Japan; S-1 is not recommended.

The use of a rigid barrier disc (HeartShield™) has been suggested to offer protection against this lethal complication by preventing the heart from being drawn up by the negative pressure and damaged by the sharp sternum bone edges. Seven patients treated with conventional NPWT and seven patients treated with NPWT with a protective barrier disc (HeartShield) were compared with regard to bacterial clearance and infection parameters including C-reactive protein levels and leucocyte counts. C-reactive protein levels and leucocyte counts dropped faster and bacterial clearance occurred earlier in the HeartShield® group compared with the conventional NPWT group. Negative biopsy cultures were shown after 3·1 ± 0·4 NPWT dressing changes in the HeartShield group, and after 5·4 ± 0·6 NPWT dressing changes in the conventional NPWT group (P < 0·001). All patients were followed up with clinical check-up after 3 months. None of the patients in the HeartShield group had any signs of reinfection such as deep sternal wound infection (DSWI) or sternal fistulas, whereas in the conventional NPWT group, two patients had signs of sternal fistulas that demanded hospitalisation. HeartShield hinders the right ventricle to come into contact with the sharp sternal edges during NPWT and thereby protects from heart damage. This study shows that using HeartShield is beneficial in treating patients with DSWI. Improved wound healing by HeartShield may be a result of the efficient drainage of wound effluents from the thoracic cavity.",rwrtvsrm

The installation of a food waste disposer (FWD) may increase the discharge of food waste (FW) into the wastewater; therefore, the installation of a FWD is discouraged in households that have a septic system. This study was conducted to determine how a typical dose of FW from a FWD can affect the performance of a septic system in terms of sewage treatment and solids accumulation. A 20-L control tank was compared with an experiment tank to which FW was added, increasing the amount of total suspended solids (TSS) by 31.3% and total chemical oxygen demands by 46.3% for a period of 110 days. Although the influent water quality changed dramatically, the effluent from the experiment tank had a substantially lower percentage increase in water quality parameters compared with the effluent from the control. It was found that in the experiment tank, 75.8% of FW TSS was degraded, whereas only 36.7% of sewage TSS was degraded, and that 18.8% of FW TSS and 44.9% of sewage TSS accumulated in the experiment tank. The addition of FW increased the scum accumulation, even though the dry matter of the scum layer was much less in quantity than the sludge layer. It also increased the lipid content in the sludge. The increase in the scum layer was mainly due to the increase in protein from the addition of the FW. Overall, compared with sewage TSS, FW TSS tends to be more biodegradable, which indicates that the impact on pumping frequency from adding FW will be insignificant.",lgcnzem2

The optimal surgical approach for more advanced disease is unknown. An evaluation of MIE in patients with advanced tumors having undergone neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) is presented. METHODS A retrospective review of patients with esophageal cancer who underwent MIE from November 2006 to November 2011 was performed RESULTS In total, 96 consecutive patients underwent MIE for malignancy. Median age was 65 years (range 26 to 88), and 86% were male. Adenocarcinoma represented 87% of patients. Eighty-three percent of patients were staged IIa or higher and 62 (65%) patients received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Four (6%) patients additionally received intraoperative electron beam radiotherapy. Twenty-six (27%) patients received postoperative adjuvant therapy with 22 (85%) of these having also received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. All cases were completed thoraco-laparoscopically except for 2 conversions to mini-laparotomy. Twelve (12%) cervical anastomoses and 84 (88%) thoracic anastomoses were performed. Median operative time was 326 minutes (range 193 to 567) and did not differ significantly between those with and without nCRT. Complete pathologic response was seen in 21 (34%) of the 62 patients receiving neoadjuvant treatment. Major and minor morbidities were experienced in 28% and 38.5% of patients. There were 2 (2%) in-hospital mortalities; 1 each having received or not received neoadjuvant therapy. At median follow-up 24 months (range 3 to 70 months), overall survival was 58% and 55 (57%) patients were alive without recurrence. CONCLUSIONS Minimally invasive esophagectomy is an acceptable surgical therapy for advanced-stage esophageal malignancies after nCRT without evidence for increased morbidity or mortality.",ivtz4lca

METHOD Retrospective review of all adult asthma admissions to the Hospital CCC between 2000 and 2015. Demographic, physiological, treatment data and blood gas results were recorded. RESULTS There were 265 asthma admissions to Middlemore Hospital CCC during the study period. The median age was 34 years; 64% were female. NIV was used in 186 admissions, of which eight went on to require intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). Twenty-three other admissions received IMV without a trial of NIV and a further 58 were managed with medical care only. The average pH for all admissions was 7.23 and the IMV group had an average pH of 6.99. Forty-five admissions presented with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of ≤10. Twenty-five of these were managed with NIV with only one requiring subsequent intubation. The mean duration of NIV in this group was 5 h (range 1-17 h) with a mean ICU and hospital length of stay of 17 h and 3.5 days, respectively. All patients in this group effectively lowered the pCO2 over a 2 h period with NIV having an average drop of 5.9 kPa and IMV 3.4 kPa. CONCLUSION The use of NIV appears to be safe and effective in patients with severe asthma, including selected patients with an altered level of consciousness. NIV was well tolerated with a low need for subsequent intubation.",qkk2g77f

This preclinical study compares the behavior of a new mesh (Parietex composite ventral patch [Ptx]) with that of two existing meshes used for ventral hernia repair. MATERIALS AND METHODS Fifty-four New Zealand White rabbits (3000 g) were used in an experimental model of umbilical hernia repair (diameter 1.5 cm). The materials tested were: Ventralex ST hernia patch (Vent) (Bard Davol Inc, Warwick, RI) (n = 18); Proceed ventral patch (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ) (PVP) (n = 18) and Ptx (Covidien, Sofradim, Trevoux, France) (n = 18). At 3, 7, 14 d, and 6 wk after implant, peritoneal behavior and adhesion formation were assessed by sequential laparoscopy. Mesh mesothelial cover was determined by scanning electron microscopy. Host tissue ingrowth (collagens I and III) and the macrophage response were assessed by immunohistochemical labeling. Animals were euthanized at 2, 6 wk, and 6 mo after surgery. Data were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS Adhesion formation from 3 d-6 wk was significantly greater (P < 0.05) for PVP compared with Vent or Ptx. Three encapsulated PVP implants showed ""tissue-integrated"" adhesions affecting the intestinal loops. All three implant types showed similar patterns of collagen l and III deposition. The PVP mesh elicited the greater macrophage response both at 2 wk and 6 mo. CONCLUSIONS Ptx and Vent showed excellent mesothelialization, which led to minimum adhesion formation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS From January 2012 to July 2014, local excision was performed using a TEO system in 46 consecutive patients with rectal tumors. Patient and tumor characteristics and perioperative outcomes were prospectively assessed. RESULTS The median patient age was 56 years for 15 women and 31 men. The mean tumor size was 1.8 cm, and the mean distance from the anal verge was 7.8 cm. The mean operative time was 85 minutes, and the mean postoperative hospital stay was 4.5 days. The postoperative pathologic diagnosis was adenocarcinoma for 17 patients (37%), adenoma for 4 patients (9%), carcinoid tumor for 23 patients (50%), and leiomyoma and lipoma for the 2 remaining patients (2%). A positive resection margin was documented for 4 patients (9%). No mortality was associated with the procedure although postoperative bleeding, leakage, perianal fistula, fecal incontinence, and voiding difficulty developed in 8 patients. According to the cumulative sum (CUSUM) analysis, the operation time and hospital stay significantly decreased after 17 case experiences. CONCLUSIONS TEO is a feasible and safe treatment option for local excision of rectal tumors. TEO has the advantage of being a precise surgical procedure with a stable and magnifying endoscopic view. However, TEO requires a learning period and a careful selection of patients through proper indications and preoperative diagnostics.",4irb8e28

In the current study, we conducted a systematic review of the outcome literature on CBT-E, with both narrative and meta-analytic synthesis. We included single-group uncontrolled pre-post design studies and randomised control trials (RCTs) of CBT-E, which allowed us to include a larger number of studies, and also compare the two methodologies in terms of effect size. The primary analysis included 15 CBT-E studies with a total of 948 participants. Narrative synthesis examined bingeing and purging episodes, BMI change, and follow-up results. A large, statistically significant effect supported CBT-E as a treatment for all EDs (g = 1.06). When comparing methodologies, both pre-post design studies (g = 1.26) and RCTs (g = 0.82) yielded large effects. Narrative synthesis outlined reductions in ED behaviours and increases in BMI which were maintained at follow-up. Limitations include that further RCTs of CBT-E are needed to establish clinical effectiveness of this treatment approach for all EDs; however, results from narrative exploration indicate this endeavour would be worthwhile. Despite the limitations, this study provides additional support for CBT-E as a successful treatment across the range of EDs.",xr41xya0

By screening 102 lung adenocarcinomas negative for known oncogenic alterations, we found four additional fusion-positive tumors, all of which were of the invasive mucinous subtype. Mechanistically, CD74-NRG1 leads to extracellular expression of the EGF-like domain of NRG1 III-β3, thereby providing the ligand for ERBB2-ERBB3 receptor complexes. Accordingly, ERBB2 and ERBB3 expression was high in the index case, and expression of phospho-ERBB3 was specifically found in tumors bearing the fusion (P < 0.0001). Ectopic expression of CD74-NRG1 in lung cancer cell lines expressing ERBB2 and ERBB3 activated ERBB3 and the PI3K-AKT pathway, and led to increased colony formation in soft agar. Thus, CD74-NRG1 gene fusions are activating genomic alterations in invasive mucinous adenocarcinomas and may offer a therapeutic opportunity for a lung tumor subtype with, so far, no effective treatment. SIGNIFICANCE CD74–NRG1 fusions may represent a therapeutic opportunity for invasive mucinous lung adenocarcinomas, a tumor with no effective treatment that frequently presents with multifocal unresectable disease.",eynb8dep

MATERIALS AND METHODS The study encompassed 91 recessions in 29 patients for whom MCAT was combined with CM on one side of the mandible and SCTG on the contralateral one. The following clinical parameters were measured: gingival recession height (GR) and width (RW), probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), width of keratinized tissue (KT), gingival thickness (GT), mean (MRC) and complete root coverage (CRC) and Root Coverage Esthetic Score (RES). RESULTS The MRC proportions on the CM- and SCTG-treated sides were 53.20% and 83.10%, respectively. CRC was achieved in 9 out of 45 (20%) gingival defects treated with CM and 31 out of 46 (67%) treated with SCTG. There were statistically significant differences in MRC, CRC, GR, RW, KT, GT and RES between CM- and CTG-treated sides. CONCLUSIONS Modified coronally advanced tunnel technique leads to reduction in gingival recession both when combined CM and SCTG, of which the latter is more efficient as far as root coverage and aesthetic parameters are concerned.",9ri4rk6r

Clinically, however, the benefits of single-port TEP (SP TEP) are unclear. This study aimed to compare short-term surgical outcomes between SP TEP and conventional laparoscopic TEP(CL TEP) inguinal hernia repair. METHODS Between January 2013 and February 2015, 99 men with primary unilateral inguinal hernia were randomized to the single-port or conventional 3-port TEP procedures. The primary end point was postoperative pain. Secondary end points were complications, postoperative hospital stay, days to return to daily normal activities, cosmesis, and quality of life (QOL). RESULTS We randomized 50 patients to SP TEP and 49 to CL TEP repair. The SP TEP group patients had significantly lower pain scores (visual analog scale) 7 days postoperation (p = 0.017). However, there were no significant differences between the two groups in postoperative pain scores 24 h (p = 0.44) and 4 weeks (p = 0.677) after operation and analgesic requirements on the operation day (p = 0.303) and 7 days after the operation (p = 0.204). Operation time, postoperative hospital stay, and complications were comparable between the two groups. The days to return to daily normal activities, QOL, and cosmetic satisfaction were not different between the two groups. CONCLUSION The outcomes of SP TEP hernia repair for operation time and morbidities were comparable to CL TEP, and postoperative pain was lower at 7 days than in CL TEP hernia repair. The SP TEP technique can be recommended as an alternative treatment for inguinal hernia repair in experienced hands.",yyohn8tt

The use of flow-diverting stents (FDS) has had mixed results. We sought to evaluate our experience of FDS for the treatment of this pathology. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed our database of prospectively collected information for all patients treated only with flow diversion for an unruptured non-saccular aneurysm of the posterior circulation between February 2009 and April 2016. The aneurysms were classified as dolichoectasia, fusiform or transitional, and imaging characteristics including maximal diameter, disease vessel segment, MRI features (intra-aneurysmal thrombus, T1 hyperintensity in the aneurysmal wall, infarctions in the territory of the posterior circulation, and mass effect) were recorded alongside clinical and follow-up data. RESULTS We identified 56 patients (45 men) with 58 aneurysms. The average age of the patients was 63.5 years. Twenty-two patients were symptomatic from the aneurysms at presentation. The majority of the lesions were vertebrobasilar in location (44.8%) with isolated vertebral lesions representing 29.3% of aneurysms. Transitional aneurysms were the most common (48.2%). The mean maximal diameter of the aneurysms was 11 mm. Angiographic exclusion of the aneurysms was seen in 57.4% of aneurysms with follow-up (n=47). During the follow-up period nine patients died. CONCLUSIONS Treatment of non-saccular aneurysms of the posterior fossa is technically possible. Early treatment, particularly of the fusiform and transitional subtypes, is recognized, as is treatment prior to the development of symptoms. A 'watch and wait' strategy with regular imaging follow-up could be employed for asymptomatic dolichoectasia.",355dgzmz

Prior studies of pain caused by heel and arterial needlesticks found oral administration of 24% sucrose to significantly blunt pain during these painful procedures. No studies have evaluated this treatment with needlestick pain associated with PIV catheter insertion. METHODS Oral 24% sucrose or placebo solution was administered 2 minutes prior to PIV catheter insertion. Outcome measures were obtained prior to, during, and for 5 minutes after PIV catheter insertion. Investigators and caregivers were blinded to group assignment. Data were analyzed with longitudinal analysis of repeated measures, with P < .05 for significance. RESULTS A total of 40 neonates (24% sucrose: N = 20; placebo: N = 20) were studied. Pain scores significantly increased from 3.2 ± 1.6 to a maximum of 7.6 ± 3.8 at the time of catheter insertion, returning to baseline levels 8 minutes after PIV catheter insertion (P < .001). No significant differences were found in pain, heart rate, or noninvasive oxygen saturation (SpO2) between the sucrose and placebo groups (P > 0.05). IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE Results from this study did not find that 24% sucrose administered prior to PIV catheter insertion altered the infant's pain response. IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH Since this is the first study to evaluate the pain-blunting effects of 24% sucrose administration before PIV catheter insertion, replication of this study is needed before widespread application of findings.",xoql4bxp

COVID-19 occurrence in a low prevalence area.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused more than 200,000 reported COVID-19 cases in Spain resulting in more than 20,800 deaths as of April 21, 2020. Faecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from COVID-19 patients has extensively been reported. Therefore, we investigated the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in six wastewater treatments plants (WWTPs) serving the major municipalities within the Region of Murcia (Spain), the area with the lowest COVID-19 prevalence within Iberian Peninsula. Firstly, an aluminum hydroxide adsorption-precipitation concentration method was validated using a porcine coronavirus (Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus, PEDV) and mengovirus (MgV). The procedure resulted in average recoveries of 10 ± 3.5% and 10 ± 2.1% in influent water (n = 2) and 3.3 ± 1.6% and 6.2 ± 1.0% in effluent water (n = 2) samples for PEDV and MgV, respectively. Then, the method was used to monitor the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 from March 12 to April 14, 2020 in influent, secondary and tertiary effluent water samples. By using the real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) Diagnostic Panel validated by US CDC that targets three regions of the virus nucleocapsid (N) gene, we estimated quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA titers in untreated wastewater samples of 5.4 ± 0.2 log10 genomic copies/L on average. Two secondary water samples resulted positive (2 out of 18) and all tertiary water samples tested as negative (0 out 12). This environmental surveillance data were compared to declared COVID-19 cases at municipality level, revealing that members of the community were shedding SARS-CoV-2 RNA in their stool even before the first cases were reported by local or national authorities in many of the cities where wastewaters have been sampled. The detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater in early stages of the spread of COVID-19 highlights the relevance of this strategy as an early indicator of the infection within a specific population. At this point, this environmental surveillance could be implemented by municipalities right away as a tool, designed to help authorities to coordinate the exit strategy to gradually lift its coronavirus lockdown.",611ih9pl

It is unclear what is being done in actual practice. The purpose of this study was to report practice patterns for treatment of inguinal hernias among Quebec surgeons, and to identify factors that may be associated with the choice of operative approach. METHODS We studied a population-based cohort of patients who underwent an inguinal hernia repair between 2007 and 2011 in Quebec, Canada. A generalized linear model was used to identify predictors associated with the selection of a laparoscopic approach. RESULTS 49,657 inguinal hernias were repaired by 478 surgeons. Laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair (LIHR) was used in 8 % of all cases. LIHR was used to repair 28 % of bilateral hernias, 10 % of recurrent hernias, 6 % of unilateral hernias, and 4 % of incarcerated hernias. 268 (56 %) surgeons did not perform any laparoscopic repairs, and 11 (2 %) surgeons performed more than 100 repairs. These 11 surgeons performed 61 % of all laparoscopic cases. Patient factors significantly associated with having LIHR included younger age, fewer comorbidities, bilateral hernias, and recurrent hernias. CONCLUSION An open approach is favored for all clinical scenarios, even for situations where published guidelines recommend a laparoscopic approach. Surgeons remain divided on the best technique for inguinal hernia repair: while more than half never perform LIHR, the small proportion who perform many use the technique for a large proportion of their cases. There appears to be a gap between the best practices put forth in guidelines and what surgeons are doing in actual practice. Identification of barriers to the broader uptake of LIHR may help inform the design of educational programs to train those who have the desire to offer this technique for certain cases, and have the volume to overcome the learning curve.",whc2n82g

METHODS Forty-eight patients with localized prostate cancer were enrolled in this study and were divided randomly into two groups, which were treated by the standard PR technique (standard PR group; n = 24) or the three-layer PR technique using peritoneum (three-layer PR group; n = 24) during RARP. We prospectively analyzed the continence rate by the 1-hour pad test. All patients underwent urethrocystography at 6 days postoperatively to evaluate position of vesicourethral junction. Pelvic MRI was also performed at 6 months postoperatively for anatomical evaluation. RESULTS Four weeks after RARP, the urinary continence rate was significantly higher in the three-layer PR group (57%) than in the standard PR group (26%, p = 0.036). Urethrocystography demonstrated that the postoperative craniocaudal distance from the symphysis pubis to the level of the vesicourethral junction was significantly shorter in the three-layer PR group than in the standard PR group (p < 0.01), suggesting that there was less tension on the vesicourethral anastomosis after three-layer PR. MRI confirmed that three-layer PR provided firmer reinforcement of the structures, supporting the posterior aspect of the urethral sphincter complex. CONCLUSIONS This prospective comparative study might suggest that three-layer two-step PR using peritoneum during RARP is a simple and feasible method seeming to improve early recovery of postoperative continence compared with standard two-step PR, although larger multicenter randomized controlled trials will be needed.",bvt886g1

We undertook a study, in a sheep model of acute brain injury, to assess a new non-invasive brain oximeter. The monitor uses the principles of pulse oximetry to record a pulse and oxygen levels. Methods We studied 8 sheep. An acute increase in intracranial pressure was induced with an injection of blood into the cranial vault. The temporal changes in the brain oximeter, intracranial pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure were recorded. Simultaneous conventional skin pulse oximetry was also recorded to assess the possible influence of skin blood flow on the brain oximeter signal. Results At baseline, a pulsatile waveform consistent with the brain circulation was obtained in 7 animals. The baseline brain pulse was quite distinct from the simultaneous conventional skin pulse and similar in shape to a central venous pressure waveform. Injection of blood into the cranial vault triggered an immediate increase in intracranial pressure and fall in cerebral perfusion pressure, by 60-s cerebral perfusion pressure recovered. The brain oximeter oxygen levels demonstrated similar changes with an immediate fall and recovery by 60 s. Periods of high intracranial pressure were also associated with high-frequency oscillations in the brain pulse waveform; there was, however, no change in the conventional skin pulse oximeter pulse waveform. Conclusion The brain oximeter detected acute changes in both oxygen levels and the brain pulse waveform following an increase in intracranial pressure levels. The brain oximeter could assist clinicians in the management of acute brain injury.",81u3wcg7

METHOD Data were analyzed from intake information obtained from 1584 adult patients presenting at a community-based private sleep medical center. The sample was parsed into a Suicidal Ideation (SI) group (N=211) and No Suicidal Ideation (NSI) group (N=1373). Comparisons of these groups were made on measures of self-reported sleep complaints, habits, and behaviors, suicidal ideation, depressive symptoms, and associated psychopathology. RESULTS Approximately 13% of participants reported suicidal ideation. Clinically significant suicidal ideation was present in 4.5% of the sample. Compared to the NSI group, the SI group showed a pervasive pattern of significantly greater frequency or severity of sleep problems in areas of insomnia, nightmares and other parasomnia behaviors, poor sleep quality, and sleep-related psychophysiologic conditioning as well as worse sleep-related impairment and quality of life. Several relationships were significant after controlling for depressive symptoms. DISCUSSION Suicidal ideation was consistently associated with a broad array of sleep complaints, even when controlling for level of depressive symptoms. As these self-reported sleep disturbances are treatable sleep disorders, future research should examine the efficacy of sleep and behavioral medicine for reducing the risk of suicidal ideation.",5r7rgd9e

METHODS A retrospective chart review identified 248 patients who were treated for symptomatic peripheral artery disease with the Lutonix DCB between May 2013 and October 2014. Forty patients were lost to follow-up, leaving 208 patients (mean age 74.1±9.7 years; 138 men) with evaluable data for outcome analysis. The patient cohort suffered from either severe claudication (38.6%) or critical limb ischemia (CLI; 61.4%) in 220 limbs. Almost two-thirds (140, 63.6%) of the 220 target lesions were total occlusions, and 37 (17.8%) of all patients had occlusion of all 3 BTK vessels before intervention. RESULTS Over a median 9-month follow-up, target lesion revascularization occurred in 15.9% of patients with an average time to first reintervention of 8 months. In total, 39 amputations were performed in 31 limbs. However, 17 of these amputations were preplanned minor amputations below the ankle; only 9 (4.1%) major amputations occurred corresponding to 6.6% of the CLI cohort. Freedom from the composite of death or major amputation was estimated as 92% and 85% at 6 and 12 months, respectively, by Kaplan-Meier analysis. In the full cohort, improvement of at least 1 Rutherford category was seen in 130 (59.1%) limbs after 1 year or at the last follow-up, with 104 (80.0%) of those limbs showing an improvement of ≥2 categories. CONCLUSION From this single-center experience, the Lutonix DCB shows therapeutic promise in a disease state where new treatment options are needed.",0ig0ddxr

Advances in minimally invasive surgery have led to the application of these techniques to malignant lesions, including Wilms tumor. We aim to present our experience with laparoscopic nephrectomy (LN) for Wilms tumor. PATIENTS AND METHODS Four patients with Wilms tumor were treated preoperatively with chemotherapy and afterwards underwent an LN and lymph node sampling. Four ports were placed and the tumors were removed without morcellation in an endoscopic bag through an incision by extending the umbilical or the suprapubic port site. RESULTS The average age at the time of surgery was 3 years and 7 months (range, 23 mo to 6 y). There were no intraoperative complications and the blood loss was minimal in all cases. The mean operative time was 125 minutes (range, 90 to 160 min). Among our patients, we had 2 stage IV and 2 stage I cases. The mean time of hospitalization was 3 days (range, 2 to 4 d). There were no long-term complications at the mean follow-up of 3 years and 6 months. CONCLUSIONS LN for Wilms tumor may be considered as an option in selected patients. Minimally invasive surgery allows the surgeon to follow all the oncologic principles required for surgical treatment of this neoplasm and provides the advantages of these techniques for cancer patients.

DESIGN Cross-sectional study. ANIMALS 100 dogs evaluated at an open-admission municipal animal shelter in Florida. PROCEDURES Fecal samples were collected within 24 hours after admission from 50 dogs with normal feces and 50 dogs with diarrhea. Feces were tested by fecal flotation, antigen testing, PCR assay, and electron microscopy for selected enteropathogens. RESULTS 13 enteropathogens were identified. Dogs with diarrhea were significantly more likely to be infected with ≥ 1 enteropathogens (96%) than were dogs with normal feces (78%). Only Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin A gene was significantly more common in dogs with diarrhea (64%) than in dogs with normal feces (40%). Other enteropathogens identified in dogs with and without diarrhea included hookworms (58% and 48%, respectively), Giardia spp (22% and 16%, respectively), canine enteric coronavirus (2% and 18%, respectively), whipworms (12% and 8%, respectively), Cryptosporidium spp (12% and 2%, respectively), ascarids (8% and 8%, respectively), Salmonella spp (2% and 6%, respectively), Cystoisospora spp (2% and 4%, respectively), canine distemper virus (8% and 0%, respectively), Dipylidium caninum (2% and 2%, respectively), canine parvovirus (2% and 2%, respectively), and rotavirus (2% and 0%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Dogs entered the shelter with a variety of enteropathogens, many of which are pathogenic or zoonotic. Most infections were not associated with diarrhea or any specific dog characteristics, making it difficult to predict the risk of infection for individual animals. Guidelines for preventive measures and empirical treatments that are logistically and financially feasible for use in shelters should be developed for control of the most common and important enteropathogens.",wsklte5h

The objective of this study was to evaluate whether aspirin, known to be effective for prevention of VTEs after primary arthroplasty, is also effective after revision TJA. METHODS We studied 2997 consecutive patients who underwent revision TJA between 2005 and 2013 and were treated with intermittent pneumatic compression devices and either aspirin (534 patients) or warfarin (2463 patients) for VTE prophylaxis. Pertinent data including the incidence of symptomatic VTEs, bleeding events, infection, and mortality were retrieved from our prospectively collected database. RESULTS The incidence of symptomatic VTEs was significantly higher in the warfarin group at 1.75% (43 of 2463) compared with 0.56% (3 of 534) in the aspirin group (odds ratio: 3.2; 95% CI: 1.03-16.3; P = .03). There was a higher rate of bleeding events with administration of warfarin (1.5%) compared with aspirin (0.4%; P = .02; odds ratio: 4.1; 95% CI: 1.2-34.0). The rate of surgical site infection was similar between the aspirin group and the warfarin group (1.61% and 1.70%, respectively). CONCLUSION Administration of aspirin as prophylaxis against VTEs after revision arthroplasty may be a viable option as it appears to be more effective than warfarin in prevention of symptomatic VTEs and is associated with a lower rate of complications.",dgjrtfza

SURGICAL PROCEDURE Our standardized anatomic-based ""IVC-first, kidney-last"" technique for robot-assisted IVC thrombectomy focuses on minimizing the chances of an intraoperative tumor thromboembolism and major hemorrhage. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Baseline demographics, pathology data, 90-d and 1-yr complications, and oncologic outcomes at last follow-up were assessed. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS Robot-assisted IVC thrombectomy was successful in 24 patients (96%) (level III: n=11; level II: n=13); one patient was electively converted to open surgery for failure to progress. Median data included operative time of 4.5h, estimated blood loss was 240ml, hospital stay 4 d; five patients (21%) received intraoperative blood transfusion. All surgical margins were negative. Complications occurred in four patients (17%): two were Clavien 2, one was Clavien 3a, and one was Clavien 3b. All patients were alive at a 16-mo median follow-up (range: 12-39 mo). CONCLUSIONS Robotic IVC tumor thrombectomy is feasible for level II-III thrombi. To maximize intraoperative safety and chances of success, a thorough understanding of applied anatomy and altered vascular collateral flow channels, careful patient selection, meticulous cross-sectional imaging, and a highly experienced robotic team are essential. PATIENT SUMMARY We present the detailed operative steps of a new minimally invasive robot-assisted surgical approach to treat patients with advanced kidney cancer. This type of surgery can be performed safely with low blood loss and excellent outcomes. Even patients with advanced kidney cancer could now benefit from robotic surgery with a quicker recovery.",9xvndua0

radiofrequency ablation for large-diameter incompetent great saphenous vein.,"Purpose There is limited data on the outcomes of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for large diameter saphenous veins. This study aimed to determine whether the large-diameter great saphenous vein (GSV) affected closure rate, complications, and clinical and quality of life (QoL) improvement. Methods From January 2012 to September 2016, a total of 722 limbs were treated with ClosureFAST RFA in a single center. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to the vein diameter measured 3 cm below the saphenofemoral junction (group A ≤ 12 mm, group B > 12 mm). Vein closure was evaluated with duplex scan at 3-5 days, 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. The incidence of complications, improvements in symptoms (measured by the Venous Clinical Severity Score [VCSS]) and QoL (measured by the Aberdeen Varicose Vein Symptom Severity Score [AVSS]) were evaluated. Results Groups consisted of 663 GSVs in group A (mean diameter, 6.00 ± 1.74 mm) and 59 in group B (mean diameter, 13.17 ± 1.28 mm). Vein closure rates at 12 months were 98.9% in group A and 100% in group B (P = 0.428). There was no significant difference in the incidence of complications. Both groups showed marked improvements in the VCSS and the AVSS with no significant differences. Conclusion For large-diameter veins, RFA showed comparable outcomes in terms of closure rate, complications, clinical and QoL improvements.",j5vatnxw

Thus, therapeutic options are urgently needed, and will be discussed in this review. Recent findings: Iron-containing enzymes are required for viruses most likely including coronaviruses (CoVs) to complete their replication process. Moreover, poor prognosis occurred in the conditions of iron overload for patients upon infections of viruses. Thus, limiting iron represents a promising adjuvant strategy in treating viral infection through oral uptake or venous injection of iron chelators, or through the manipulation of the key iron regulators. For example, treatment with iron chelator deferiprone has been shown to prolong the survival of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients. Increasing intracellular iron efflux via increasing iron exporter ferroportin expression also exhibits antiviral effect on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The implications of other metals besides iron are also briefly discussed. : For even though we know little about iron regulation in COVID-19 patients thus far, it could be deduced from other viral infections that iron chelation might be an alternative beneficial adjuvant in treating COVID-19.",guifr8hc

OBJECTIVE To assess contemporary outcomes of transvenous embolization as a stand-alone therapy for cerebral AVMs. METHODS We prospectively followed 40 patients with 41 AVMs who underwent transvenous endovascular therapy between January 2008 and January 2015. Patient demographics, AVM characteristics, endovascular techniques used, angiographic results, clinical outcomes, and complications were assessed independently. RESULTS Thirty-eight of 41 (92.6%) AVMs were anatomically cured. The mean patient age was 37.7 yr (range, 18-69 yr) and 55% were female. Twenty-seven (67.5%) patients presented with hemorrhage. The mean size of the AVM nidus was 2.8 ± 1.2 cm, and low Spetzler-Martin grade AVMs comprised 41.5% of lesions. The majority of patients were treated in 1 session (56%; n = 23). The mean follow-up period was 28.4 (range, 6-106 mo). There was 1 (2.5%) hemorrhagic complication related to microcatheter navigation and 1 (2.5%) venous infarction was observed without clinical consequences. At 6-mo follow-up, 1 (2.5%) patient had significant disability. There were no recurrences during the follow-up period. Overall mortality was 2.5% and procedure-related mortality was 0%. CONCLUSION This prospective contemporary series demonstrates a high rate of complete AVM obliteration and excellent functional outcomes in patients with both ruptured and unruptured AVMs treated with transvenous embolization. This approach is promising and warrants further investigation as a treatment for select AVMs.",horr1gyi

Great improvement in endovascular techniques was provided by the introduction of Onyx with different kinds of approach. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy and the safety of Onyx embolization of brain AVMs with the double arterial catheterization technique (DACT). METHODS This was a retrospective study. From January 2006 until June 2011, 61 AVMs eligible for the DACT were treated. Forty-one of the 61 AVMs were treated with single arterial catheterization technique and 20 of 61 with DACT; patient age and Spetzler-Martin AVM grade were similar in the 2 groups. RESULTS In the DACT group, we obtained complete occlusion of the nidus in all small AVMs, whereas in the single arterial catheterization technique group, we obtained complete occlusion in only 1 of the 36% of the cases. Among the medium-size AVMs, there were no significant differences in the 2 groups, but we performed fewer procedures per patient when we used the DACT (1.4 vs 2.2). In the DACT group, we observed fewer hemorrhagic complications (3.4% vs 12.5% per procedure) and lower morbidity (5% vs 7% per patient) and mortality (0% vs 2.4%) rates. CONCLUSION The DACT in multifeeder AVMs may lead to a higher occlusion rate of the nidus for small AVMs and reduce the number of procedures, ensuring a higher standard of safety because of the possibility of managing the progression of Onyx into venous drainage.",iot1n8ij

Complete closure of these lesions is necessary to reduce these risks. The purpose of our study was to compare the outcome of DAVFs treated with Onyx versus those treated with n-Butyl Cyanoacrylate (nBCA) and coil embolization in a case-control study. Compared with nBCA and coil embolization, we hypothesized that Onyx embolization for DAVF is safer and has a higher chance of complete obliteration, with no need for post-embolization surgery for the DAVF. MATERIALS AND METHODS From 1998 to 2015, 29 patients who had DAVFs were treated with endovascular embolization. Of these, 24 patients had imaging available for analysis. Successful closure rates, complications, and procedure time were compared between the embolization techniques. RESULTS The chance of not requiring post-embolization surgery with Onyx (81.8%) was significantly higher (p = 0.005) than with nBCA (22.22%). The complication rate with Onyx (9.1%) tended to be lower compared with that of nBCA (22.22%; p = 0.37). Procedural time was not significantly different between Onyx (mean 267 minutes) and nBCA (mean 288 minutes) (p = 0.59). The odds ratio of a DAVF being treated with Onyx and then requiring no follow-up surgery was 17.5 (95% CI 1.97-155.4). CONCLUSION Our case-control study suggests that Onyx embolization is superior to nBCA and coil embolization in completely obliterating DAVFs, with higher odds of no post-embolization surgery. We also found that Onyx is safe for embolization of DAVFs, with no associated neurological mortality and morbidity.",d9f1o5m7

METHODS we retrospectively identified 60 patients who had been evaluated for known or suspected BVM by both SWI and digital subtraction angiography, without intervening treatment, during a 3-year period. SWI images were retrospectively assessed by 2 independent reviewers for the presence of AVS as determined by the presence of signal hyperintensity within a venous structure in the vicinity of the BVM. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus among a panel of 3 neuroradiologists. Accuracy parameters of SWI for the detection of AVS were calculated using digital subtraction angiography as the reference standard. RESULTS a total of 80 BVM were identified in the 60 patients included in our study. Of the 29 BVM with AVS on digital subtraction angiography, 14 were untreated arteriovenous malformations, 10 were previously treated arteriovenous malformations, and 5 were untreated dural arteriovenous fistulas. Overall, SWI was 93% sensitive and 98% specific for the detection of AVS in BVM, with excellent interobserver agreement (κ=0.94). In the 14 previously treated arteriovenous malformations, SWI was 100% sensitive and specific for the detection of AVS. In the 28 BVM associated with intracerebral hemorrhage, SWI was 100% sensitive and 96% specific for the detection of AVS. CONCLUSIONS SWI is accurate for the detection of arteriovenous shunting in vascular malformations of the brain and, for some patients, SWI may offer a noninvasive alternative to angiography in screening for or follow-up of treated BVM.",z4x06v2u

We investigated the immunomodulating effects of an innovative TCM regimen derived from two herbal formulas (Sang Ju Yin and Yu Ping Feng San) for treating febrile diseases. Thirty-seven healthy volunteers were given the oral TCM regimen daily for 14 days. Peripheral venous blood samples were taken on days 0, 15 and 29 for hematology, biochemistry and immunology tests, including the measurement of blood lymphocyte subsets and plasma T-helper lymphocyte types 1 and 2 cytokines and receptor. After 3 months, 23 of the volunteers participated in a control study without TCM treatment for the same time course of blood tests. Two volunteers withdrew on day 2, due to headache and dizziness. All others remained well without any side effects. No participants showed significant changes in their blood test results, except that the T-lymphocyte CD4/CD8 ratio increased significantly from 1.31 +/- 0.50 (mean +/- SD) on day 0 to 1.41 +/- 0.63 on day 15 (p < 0.02), and reduced to 1.32 +/- 0.47 on day 29 (p < 0.05). In the control study, there were no changes in the CD4/CD8 ratio. The transient increase in CD4/CD8 ratio was likely due to the TCM intake.

We retrospectively reviewed eight patients with craniocervical junction DAVF who were evaluated at our institution between 2009 and 2012. We also conducted a MEDLINE search for all reports of craniocervical junction DAVF between 1970 and 2013, and reviewed 119 patients from 56 studies. From a total of 127 patients, 46 (37.1%) presented with myelopathy, 53 (43.1%) with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and four (3.3%) with brainstem dysfunction. SAH was typically mild, most often Hunt and Hess Grade I or II (83.3%), and associated with ascending venous drainage via the intracranial veins (p<0.001). Higher rates of obliteration were observed after microsurgery compared to embolization. Overall, younger age (odds ratio [OR] 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-1.12; p=0.011), hemorrhagic presentation (OR 0.17; 95% CI 0.06-0.50; p=0.001), and microsurgery (OR 0.23; 95% CI 0.08-0.6; p=0.004) were independently predictive of good outcome at the last follow-up. Microsurgery was the only independent predictor of overall improvement at the last follow-up (OR 4.35; 95% CI 1.44-13.2; p=0.009). Prompt diagnosis and microsurgical management, offering a greater chance of immediate obliteration, may optimize the outcomes for patients with craniocervical junction DAVF. Endovascular treatment is often not feasible due to lesion angioarchitecture, and is associated with a higher risk of lesion recanalization or recurrence.

The benefit of using MPEDs to assist embolization of a direct high-flow carotid cavernous fistula resulting from a ruptured cavernous carotid artery aneurysm is not well documented. METHODS We describe our experience with deploying a tailored multidevice PED construct across the cavernous internal carotid artery (ICA) wall defect in combination with transarterial coil embolization using the ""jailed microcatheter"" technique. RESULTS A 59-year-old woman presented with acute left-sided ophthalmoplegia. Diagnostic cerebral angiography demonstrated a ruptured giant cavernous carotid aneurysm with fistulous outflow via the ipsilateral left superior ophthalmic vein and into the pterygoid venous plexi bilaterally. Via the Marksman microcatheter, a total of three PEDs measuring 4.5 mm × 18 mm, 4.5 mm × 20 mm, and 4.75 mm × 16 mm were telescoped within the ICA across the aneurysm neck. Coiling of the aneurysm fundus and cavernous sinus via the ""jailed"" Rapidtransit microcatheter was subsequently achieved. A 2-year follow-up digital subtraction angiography (DSA) demonstrated stable obliteration of the aneurysm and the fistula, coincident with complete resolution of the patient's symptoms. CONCLUSIONS Based on our long-term clinical and angiographic results, we advocate that the presented method be a valid treatment option for selected cases.",qi6a0ux2

A wide margin (at least 5 mm) is generally recommended to prevent LR, but the optimal method to assess ablation margins is yet to be established. The aim of our study was to evaluate the feasibility and reproducibility of CT-CT co-registration, using MIRADA software, in order to assess ablation margins of patients with CRLM. METHODS In this retrospective study, pre- and post-ablation contrast-enhanced CT scans of 29 patients, treated with percutaneous RFA for a solitary CRLM, were co-registered. Co-registration was performed by two independent radiologist, based on venous structures in proximity to the tumor. Feasibility of CT-CT co-registration and inter-observer agreement for reproducibility and ablation margins was determined. Furthermore, the minimal ablation margin was compared with the occurrence of LR during follow-up. RESULTS Co-registration was considered feasible in 18 patients (61% male, 63.1(±10.9) year), with a perfect inter-observer agreement for completeness of ablation: κ = 1.0(p < 0.001). And substantial inter-observer agreement for measurement of the minimal margin (≤ 0 mm, 1-5 mm, ≥ 5 mm): κ = 0.723(p-value < 0.001). LR occurred in eight of nine(88.9%) incompletely ablated CRLM and in one of the nine completely ablated CRLM(11.1%). CONCLUSION Co-registration using MIRADA is reproducible and potentially a valuable tool in defining technical success. Feasibility of co-registration of pre- and post-ablation CT scans is suboptimal if scans are not acquired concordantly. Co-registration may potentially aid in the prediction of LR after percutaneous ablation.",m3bvyov9

Endovascular therapy has emerged as an adjunctive therapy in select cases but has been associated with increased hemorrhagic complications. We present our experience with a large single-center cohort of DVST cases treated with current-generation thrombectomy devices. MATERIALS AND METHODS In this retrospective cohort study, a chart review was performed to compare presentations and outcomes of patients treated with anticoagulation alone with those treated with additional interventional therapy, using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at discharge and at 90 days' follow-up. RESULTS A total of 66 patients were included; 37 were treated with anticoagulation alone, and 29 underwent additional interventional therapy. Patients presenting with ICH or infarction had a significantly greater likelihood of disability at the time of discharge (odds ratio [OR] of 64.5 and 45.8, respectively; P < .0001) and at 90 days (OR of 28.4 and 22.8, respectively; P < .0001). Patients presenting with ICH or infarction were more likely to be selected for endovascular therapy (P < .05). Endovascular therapy was typically performed within 24 hours of admission; 9 patients (31%) had post-treatment hemorrhage, with 2 being (6.9%) symptomatic. There were fewer patients with slight disability (mRS score ≤1) in the endovascular group compared with the anticoagulation group at discharge (P = .05), but outcomes were not significantly different at 90 days (P = .19). CONCLUSIONS Despite a higher rate of ICH or infarction at presentation in the endovascular group and an increased risk of postprocedural ICH, both treatment groups had similarly good functional outcomes at 90 days.",d8jv9jag

METHODS A prospective, multicentre series was conducted at 11 interventional centres in Europe to evaluate embolisation of bAVMs with the new liquid embolic agent. Technical conditions, complications, clinical outcome and anatomical results were independently analysed. RESULTS From December 2005 to December 2008, 117 patients (72 male; 45 female, aged 18-75 years) were included. Clinical presentation was mostly haemorrhage (34.2 %) and seizures (28.2 %). Most AVMs were located in the brain hemispheres (85.5 %). AVMs were <3 cm in 52.1 % of patients and ≥ 3 cm in 47.9 %. Morbidity was observed in 6/117 patients (5.1 %), related to haemorrhagic events in 2 cases and non-haemorrhagic complications in 4 cases. Five patients (4.3 %) died in relation to the treatment (bleeding in 4 patients and extensive venous thrombosis in 1). Complete occlusion of the AVM by embolisation alone was obtained in 23.5 % of patients. Complementary treatment was performed in 82.3 % of patients with partial AVM occlusion, mostly radiosurgery. CONCLUSIONS In this prospective, multicentre, European, observational series, the new liquid embolic agent proved to be suitable for BAVM embolisation, with acceptable morbidity and mortality and good efficacy. KEY POINTS • Numerous interventional techniques have been used to embolise brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). • This prospective multicentre study demonstrates the suitability of a liquid embolic agent. • The safety of treatment using Onyx is acceptable. • Such embolisation leads to complete AVM occlusion in 23.5 % of patients.",981lsckw

METHODS In a 1-year period, 461 MS patients (261 women; mean age 45.4 years, range 21-79) with CCSVI underwent endovascular treatment of 1012 venous lesions during 495 procedures [34 (6.9%) reinterventions]. While balloon angioplasty was preferred, 98 stents were implanted in 76 patients for lesion recoil, restenosis, or suboptimal dilation. The procedures were analyzed for incidences of major adverse events (death, major bleeding, or clinical deterioration of MS), access site complications, procedure-related complications, and procedural safety-related variables (fluoroscopy and contrast times). The complication rates were compared to published data for similar endovascular methods. RESULTS There were no deaths, major bleeding events, or clinical deterioration of MS. Access site complications included limited groin hematoma (5, 1.0%); there were no arteriovenous fistulas or puncture site infections. Systemic complications included only rare cardiac arrhythmias (6, 1.2%). Procedure-related complications included vein rupture (2, 0.4%), vein dissection (15, 3.0%), acute in-stent/in-segment thrombosis (8, 1.6%), and acute recoil (1, 0.2%); there was no stent migration or fracture or distal embolization. Mean fluoroscopy time was 22.7 minutes, and mean contrast volume was 136.3 mL. CONCLUSION Endovascular therapy appears to be a safe and reliable method for treating CCSVI. Innovations such as purpose-specific materials and devices are needed, as are case-controlled and randomized data to establish efficacy in ameliorating MS symptoms.",cu0njduq

METHODS Female baboons (n= 16) underwent autologous transplantation of the uterus with the Fallopian tubes and ovaries, performed with a previously published surgical technique (n= 6, Group 1) or using a modified technique (n= 10; Group 2). The uterine arteries were dissected to the proximal end of the anterior branch (Group 1) or the entire (Group 2) internal iliac artery, and the ovarian veins were dissected to the crossing over the ureter (Group 1) or further cranially to include greater lengths and patches of the cava/renal vein (Group 2). Back-table preparation created common venous and arterial ends with arterial anastomosis either end-to-side to the left external iliac artery (Group 1) or end-to-end to the left internal iliac artery (Group 2). RESULTS Overall short-time survival of the animals was 88% (66% in Group 1 and 100% in Group 2). Of all the operated animals, 75% (66% in Group 1 and 80% in Group 2) resumed ovarian cyclicity. Regular menstruation after UTx was demonstrated only in Group 2 (60%). Menstruating animals (n= 6) were each exposed to timed mating for ≥5 menstrual cycles, but pregnancy did not occur. Adhesions and tubal blockage were seen in post-mortem analysis. CONCLUSIONS The modified UTx model of Group 2 is a safe procedure and shows resumed long-term uterine function in a majority of the animals, although pregnancy could not be demonstrated.",3adn9d3n

We evaluated the outcome of patients with May-Thurner syndrome who presented with deep vein thrombosis, managed with pharmacomechanical thrombolysis as the primary mode of intervention, in combination with angioplasty and stent placement. METHODS We reviewed all patients with May-Thurner syndrome managed in our institution between January 2009 to December 2015. Patency rate and postthrombotic syndrome were evaluated as primary end points. RESULTS A total of seven patients (6 females, 1 male) with a mean ± SD age of 48 ± 17 years and mean ± SD body mass index of 29.64 ± 7.25 kg/m were identified. Six patients presented with acute deep vein thrombosis and one presented with chronic venous insufficiency. Five patients underwent pharmacomechanical thrombolysis (TRELLIS and altepase) with concomitant stenting of the common iliac vein, one had only angioplasty with stent placement, and one had only pharmacomechanical thrombolysis. Median time from presentation to pharmacomechanical thrombolysis was 4 days (range = 1-9). Patency rate and postthrombotic syndrome at 12 months were 100% and 0%, respectively. No patient experienced major bleeding or pulmonary embolism. The median length of stay was 3 days (range = 0-4). There was no mortality associated with the procedure. The mean ± SD follow-up was 26 ± 15 months. CONCLUSIONS In patients with May-Thurner syndrome, pharmacomechanical thrombolysis is an effective approach for the management of acute deep vein thrombosis, decreasing thrombus burden, and long-term postthrombotic syndrome when used in conjunction with stenting.",7yoyarm2

Since the diagnosis of life-threatening neutropenia in cancer patients requires a distinct neutrophil count, this study aimed to determine the comparative performance between the neutrophil and granulocyte count. DESIGN AND METHODS: A database of 508 646 venous full blood count results measured on a laboratory reference analyser was mined from a large oncology unit. The relationship between granulocyte and neutrophil counts was assessed. Multinomial logistic regression was used to classify results into neutropenia grades using an equivalent granulocyte count. RESULTS: Granulocyte to neutrophil count correlation was 0.997. The accuracy for classification into neutropenia grades using the derived equivalent granulocyte count ranges was 96.4%. Identification of results with a neutrophil count <1.5×10(9) cells/L using an equivalent granulocyte count of <1.69×10(9) cells/L resulted in sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of 98.0%, 99.5%, 97.8% and 99.5%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These results describe the relationship between granulocyte and neutrophil counts, measured on a laboratory analyser, in a large population of patients with malignancies and receiving anti-cancer therapies. However, this relationship must be established using a point of care testing system with a three-part differential count before considering the possibility that a granulocyte count can guide clinical decisions in the absence of a definitive neutrophil count, to reduce the frequency and severity of neutropenic complications in patients receiving cancer treatments.",9mvwhanm

For those circumstances when invasive treatment is mandatory, endovascular techniques have grown to become the mainstay of practice, choice attributable to their reported safety and effectiveness. We describe the unique and rare case of a dural arteriovenous fistula treated by transarterial embolization and complicated by an intraventricular hemorrhage. We aim to emphasize some central aspects of the perioperative management of these patients in order to help improving the future approach of similar cases. CASE REPORT A 59-year-old woman with a previously diagnosed Cognard Type IV dural arteriovenous fistula presented for transarterial embolization, performed outside the operating room, under total intravenous anesthesia. The procedure underwent without complications and the intraoperative angiography revealed complete obliteration of the fistula. In the early postoperative period, the patient presented with clinical signs of raised intracranial pressure attributable to a later diagnosed intraventricular hemorrhage, which conditioned placement of a ventricular drain, admission to an intensive care unit, cerebral vasospasm and a prolonged hospital stay. Throughout the perioperative period, there were no changes in the cerebral brain oximetry. The patient was discharged without neurological sequelae. CONCLUSION Intraventricular hemorrhage may be a serious complication after the endovascular treatment of dural arteriovenous fistula. A close postoperative surveillance and monitoring allow an early diagnosis and treatment which increases the odds for an improved outcome.",i1lgrkgd

Secondary objectives are to determine the effects of MSCs on important clinical outcomes, as described below. TRIAL DESIGN: REALIST COVID 19 is a randomised, placebo-controlled, triple blinded trial. PARTICIPANTS: The study will be conducted in Intensive Care Units in hospitals across the United Kingdom. Patients with moderate to severe ARDS as defined by the Berlin definition, receiving invasive mechanical ventilation and with a diagnosis of COVID-19 based on clinical diagnosis or PCR test will be eligible. Patients will be excluded for the following reasons: more than 72 hours from the onset of ARDS; age < 16 years; patient known to be pregnant; major trauma in previous 5 days; presence of any active malignancy (other than non-melanoma skin cancer); WHO Class III or IV pulmonary hypertension; venous thromboembolism currently receiving anti-coagulation or within the past 3 months; patient receiving extracorporeal life support; severe chronic liver disease (Child-Pugh > 12); Do Not Attempt Resuscitation order in place; treatment withdrawal imminent within 24 hours; prisoners; declined consent; non-English speaking patients or those who do not adequately understand verbal or written information unless an interpreter is available; previously enrolled in the REALIST trial. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Intervention: Allogeneic donor CD362 enriched human umbilical cord derived mesenchymal stromal cells (REALIST ORBCEL-C) supplied as sterile, single-use cryopreserved cell suspension of a fixed dose of 400 x10(6) cells in 40ml volume, to be diluted in Plasma-Lyte 148 to a total volume of 200mls for administration. Comparator (placebo): Plasma-Lyte 148 Solution for Infusion (200mls). The cellular product (REALIST ORBCEL-C) was developed and patented by Orbsen Therapeutics. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary safety outcome is the incidence of serious adverse events. The primary efficacy outcome is Oxygenation Index (OI) at day 7. Secondary outcomes include: OI at days 4 and 14; respiratory compliance, driving pressure and PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio (PF ratio) at days 4, 7 and 14; Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score at days 4, 7 and 14; extubation and reintubation; ventilation free days at day 28; duration of mechanical ventilation; length of ICU and hospital stay; 28-day and 90-day mortality. RANDOMISATION: After obtaining informed consent, patients will be randomised via a centralised automated 24-hour telephone or web-based randomisation system (CHaRT, Centre for Healthcare Randomised Trials, University of Aberdeen). Randomisation will be stratified by recruitment centre and by vasopressor use and patients will be allocated to REALIST ORBCEL-C or placebo control in a 1:1 ratio. BLINDING (MASKING): The investigator, treating physician, other members of the site research team and participants will be blinded. The cell therapy facility and clinical trials pharmacist will be unblinded to facilitate intervention and placebo preparation. The unblinded individuals will keep the treatment information confidential. The infusion bag will be masked at the time of preparation and will be administered via a masked infusion set. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): A sample size of 60 patients with 30 patients randomised to the intervention and 30 to the control group. If possible, recruitment will continue beyond 60 patients to provide more accurate and definitive trial results. The total number of patients recruited will depend on the pandemic and be guided by the data monitoring and ethics committee (DMEC). TRIAL STATUS: REALIST Phase 1 completed in January 2020 prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. This was an open label dose escalation study of REALIST ORBCEL-C in patients with ARDS. The COVID-19 pandemic emerged as REALIST Phase 2 was planned to commence and the investigator team decided to repurpose the Phase 2 trial as a COVID-19 specific trial. This decision was discussed and approved by the Trial Steering Committee (TSC) and DMEC. Submissions were made to the Research Ethics Committee (REC) and MHRA to amend the protocol to a COVID-19 specific patient population and the protocol amendment was accepted by the REC on 27(th) March 2020 and MHRA on 30(th) March 2020 respectively. Other protocol changes in this amendment included an increase in the time of onset of ARDS from 48 to 72 hours, inclusion of clinical outcomes as secondary outcomes, the provision of an option for telephone consent, an indicative sample size and provision to continue recruitment beyond this indicative sample size. The current protocol in use is version 4.0 23.03.2020 (Additional file 1). Urgent Public Health status was awarded by the NIHR on 2 April 2020 and the trial opened to recruitment and recruited the first participant the same day. At the time of publication the trial was open to recruitment at 5 sites across the UK (Belfast Health and Social Care Trust, King’s College London, Guys and St Thomas’ Hospital London, Birmingham Heartlands Hospital and the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham) and 12 patients have been recruited across these sites. Additional sites are planned to open and appropriate approvals for these are being obtained. It is estimated recruitment will continue for 6 months.

These lesions have been reported mostly in the pediatric population. OBJECTIVES To examine the clinical features and treatment outcomes for adult (≥ 18 years) patients with NGAVFs. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients with NGAVFs who underwent endovascular treatment between 2008 and 2013. A PubMed literature search was conducted to identify reports of adult patients with these lesions. RESULTS Two adults with NGAVFs were treated at our institution via transarterial embolization with a favorable outcome. The literature search revealed 24 adult NGAVF cases. Among these cases and ours, mean patient age was 33.4 ± 13.3 years, and 13 were women. Most patients experienced protracted neurological symptoms at the time of treatment whereas 5 (19.2%) patients presented with acute hemorrhage. 18 patients had single hole fistulas; 8 had multi-hole fistulas. 11 patients were treated by microsurgical ligation, 10 by embolization, 4 by combined therapy, and 1 with observation. Two patients died of reperfusion hemorrhage. Women were more likely to have a favorable outcome than men (100% vs 75.0%; p=0.07). No statistical difference was found in terms of clinical outcome for patients with single hole versus multi-hole fistulas or those treated by surgery versus embolization. CONCLUSIONS NGAVFs are extremely rare in the adult population and present a similar clinical course as in older children.

It is based on anatomical characteristics each of which makes surgical resection of an AVM more difficult, namely, deep venous drainage, eloquence of surrounding tissue, and large nidus size. A higher score correlates with more complications after treatment. Although this grading system has proven reliable over time, it does not reflect the major determinants of risk associated with endovascular treatment. The authors developed a grading system unique to endovascular treatment of cerebral AVMs. METHODS The proposed grading system accounts for the principal AVM anatomical and physiological features that make endovascular embolization more difficult and, thus, the likelihood of complications greater. These include number of arterial pedicles, diameter of arterial pedicles, and eloquent location of AVM nidus. The proposed grading system was retrospectively applied to 50 patients undergoing endovascular AVM embolization, and its ability to predict complications was compared to the Spetzler-Martin grading system. RESULTS Perioperative complications among the 50 patients included 4 major and 9 minor complications. The proposed grading system was predictive of complication risk, with an increasing rate of perioperative complications associated with an increasing AVM grade. An improved correlation of perioperative complication incidence was noted with the proposed system (P = 0.002), when compared with the Spetzler-Martin grading system (P = 0.33). CONCLUSION This grading system for the endovascular treatment of AVMs is simple, easily reproduced, and clinically valuable.",mhbedmpx

A timely closure of the left-to-right shunt will generally result in the normalization of the pulmonary hemodynamics, but a few patients have severe prognosis in their early childhood. We hypothesized that wide-ranging pathological mechanism in PAH could elucidate the clinical state of severe CHD-PAH. Using electronic medical records, we retrospectively analyzed six infants with severe CHD-PAH who had treatment-resistant PH. All patients were born with congenital malformation syndrome. After starting on a pulmonary vasodilator, five of the six patients developed complications including pulmonary edema and interstitial lung disease (ILD), and four patients had alveolar hemorrhage. After steroid therapy, the clinical condition improved in four patients, but two patients died. The autopsy findings in one of the deceased patients indicated the presence of recurrent alveolar hemorrhage, pulmonary venous hypertension, ILD, and PAH. Based on the clinical course of these CHD-PAH in patients and the literature, CHD-PAH can occur with pulmonary vascular obstructive disease (PVOD)/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis (PCH), ILD, and/or alveolar hemorrhage. The severity of CHD-PAH may depend on a genetic disorder, respiratory infection, and upper airway stenosis. Additionally, pulmonary vasodilators may be involved in the development of PVOD/PCH and ILD. When patients with CHD-PAH show unexpected deterioration, clinicians should consider complications associated with PVOD/PCH and/or pulmonary disease. In addition, the choice of upfront combination therapy for pediatric patients with CHD-PAH should be selected carefully.",2c12telo

Some investigators use a population pharmacokinetic model from existing literature and minimize the pharmacodynamic objective function. The purpose of the study was to determine whether this method selects the best-performing pharmacokinetic model in a set and provides accurate estimates of pharmacodynamic parameters in models for bispectral index in children after propofol administration. METHODS Twenty-eight children classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status 1 who were given general anesthesia for dental treatment were studied. Anesthesia was given using target-controlled infusion of propofol based on the Kataria model. Propofol target plasma concentration was 7 μg/ml for 15 min, followed by 1 μg/ml for 15 min or until signs of awakening, followed by 5 μg/ml for 15 min. Venous blood samples were taken 1, 2, 5, 10, and 15 min after each change in target. A classic pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model was estimated, and the methodology of other studies was duplicated using pharmacokinetic models from the literature and (re-)estimating the pharmacodynamic models. RESULTS There is no clear relationship between pharmacokinetic precision and the pharmacodynamic objective function. Low pharmacodynamic objective function values are not associated with accurate estimation of the pharmacodynamic parameters when the pharmacokinetic model is taken from other sources. CONCLUSION Minimization of the pharmacodynamic objective function does not select the most accurate pharmacokinetic model. Using population pharmacokinetic models from the literature instead of the 'true' pharmacokinetic model can lead to better predictions of bispectral index while incorrectly estimating the pharmacodynamic parameters.",hep5jj6x

Might the Double X-chromosome in Females Be Protective against SARS-CoV-2 Compared to the Single X-Chromosome in Males?","In December 2019, a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) from a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was recognized in the city of Wuhan, China. Rapidly, it became an epidemic in China and has now spread throughout the world reaching pandemic proportions. High mortality rates characterize SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19), which mainly affects the elderly, causing unrestrained cytokines-storm and subsequent pulmonary shutdown, also suspected micro thromboembolism events. At the present time, no specific and dedicated treatments, nor approved vaccines, are available, though very promising data come from the use of anti-inflammatory, anti-malaria, and anti-coagulant drugs. In addition, it seems that males are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 than females, with males 65% more likely to die from the infection than females. Data from the World Health Organization (WHO) and Chinese scientists show that of all cases about 1.7% of women who contract the virus will die compared with 2.8% of men, and data from Hong Kong hospitals state that 32% of male and 15% of female COVID-19 patients required intensive care or died. On the other hand, the long-term fallout of coronavirus may be worse for women than for men due to social and psychosocial reasons. Regardless of sex- or gender-biased data obtained from WHO and those gathered from sometimes controversial scientific journals, some central points should be considered. Firstly, SARS-CoV-2 has a strong interaction with the human ACE2 receptor, which plays an essential role in cell entry together with transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2); it is interesting to note that the ACE2 gene lays on the X-chromosome, thus allowing females to be potentially heterozygous and differently assorted compared to men who are definitely hemizygous. Secondly, the higher ACE2 expression rate in females, though controversial, might ascribe them the worst prognosis, in contrast with worldwide epidemiological data. Finally, several genes involved in inflammation are located on the X-chromosome, which also contains high number of immune-related genes responsible for innate and adaptive immune responses to infection. Other genes, out from the RAS-pathway, might directly or indirectly impact on the ACE1/ACE2 balance by influencing its main actors (e.g., ABO locus, SRY, SOX3, ADAM17). Unexpectedly, the higher levels of ACE2 or ACE1/ACE2 rebalancing might improve the outcome of COVID-19 in both sexes by reducing inflammation, thrombosis, and death. Moreover, X-heterozygous females might also activate a mosaic advantage and show more pronounced sex-related differences resulting in a sex dimorphism, further favoring them in counteracting the progression of the SARS-CoV-2 infection.",8oa5gkrp

OSA is defined by the apnea-hypopnea index, which is an index of OSA severity that combines apneas (pauses in breathing) and hypopneas (partial obstructions in breathing) associated with hypoxemia. Yet, other sleep metrics (i.e., oxygen nadir, arousal frequency), along with clinical symptoms and molecular markers could be better predictors of stroke and CVD outcomes in OSA. The recent focus on personalized medical care introduces the possibility of a unique approach to the treatment of OSA based on its phenotypes, defined by pathophysiological mechanisms and/or clinical presentation. We summarized what is known about OSA and its phenotypes, and review the literature on factors or intermediate markers that could increase stroke risk and CVD in patients with OSA. The OSA phenotypes where divided across three different domains (1) clinical symptoms (i.e., daytime sleepiness), (2) genetic/molecular markers, and (3) experimental data-driven approach (e.g., cluster analysis). Finally, we further highlight gaps in the literature framing a research agenda.",sbbt0zfs

METHODS From January 2010 to May 2015, 131 consecutive patients with ruptured intracranial aneurysms were treated by endovascular methods at our institution. Among the 21 patients (16%) treated by intra-arterial thrombolysis for the thrombus formation during the procedure, nine patients (nine aneurysms) suffered from thrombus remnant. We reviewed the clinical and radiologic outcomes of patients with thrombus remnant as well as intraoperative and postoperative management of thrombus formation. RESULTS Thrombus formation occurred near the coiled aneurysm in eight patients, and distal embolic occlusion was observed in one patient. All nine patients were initially managed by intra-arterial thrombolysis with tirofiban. One patient with persistent distal embolic occlusion and two patients with distal migration of the thrombus after intra-arterial thrombolysis were additionally treated with stent retriever. One patient with occlusion of the parent artery near the coiled aneurysm despite intra-arterial thrombolysis was partially recanalized by permanent deployment of a stent retriever. Delayed cerebral angiography showed no increase in size of thrombus remnant in any patients. After the procedure, thrombus remnant was managed by intravenous tirofiban. Follow-up CT angiography on the first postoperative day showed patent arterial flow, and ischemic complication related with thromboembolism did not occur in any patients. One patient suffered from hemorrhagic complication. CONCLUSION If the patency of parent artery is maintained and the size of the thrombus remnant does not increase on delayed angiography after intra-arterial thrombolysis, postoperative thromboembolic events rarely occur.",bfquk0fy

The pathogenesis may involve hemodynamic alterations secondary to increased poststenting venous sinus pressure, which may cause new arterial ingrowth into the fistulous sinus wall without capillary interposition. Despite administration of dual antiplatelet therapy, there may also be subclinical cortical vein thrombosis that contributed to DAVF formation. In addition to the aforementioned mechanisms, increased inflammation induced by VSS may upregulate vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor expression and also promote DAVF pathogenesis. Since VSS has been used to obliterate DAVFs, DAVF formation after VSS may seem counterintuitive. Previous stents have generally been closed cell, stainless steel designs used to maximize radial compression of the fistulous sinus wall. In contrast, our patient's stent was an open cell, self-expandable nitinol design (Protégé Everflex). Neurointerventionalists should be aware of this potential, although rare complication of DAVF formation after VSS.",qzx1iflk

This process leads to the formation of multinucleated giant cells and facilitates bacterial access to an uninfected host cell in a direct manner. Despite its importance in virulence, the mechanism of the T6SS-5 and the role of host cell factors in cell-cell fusion remain elusive. To date, the T6SS-5 is the only system of bacterial origin known to induce host-cell fusion. To gain insight into the nature of T6SS-5-stimulated membrane fusion, we investigated the contribution of cholesterol and proteins exposed on the host cell surface, which were shown to be critically involved in virus-mediated giant cell formation. In particular, we analyzed the effect of host cell surface protein and cholesterol depletion on the formation of multinucleated giant cells induced by B. thailandensis. Acute protease treatment of RAW264.7 macrophages during infection with B. thailandensis followed by agarose overlay assays revealed a strong reduction in the number of cell-cell fusions compared with EDTA treated cells. Similarly, proteolytic treatment of specifically infected donor cells or uninfected recipient cells significantly decreased multinucleated giant cell formation. Furthermore, modulating host cell cholesterol content by acute cholesterol depletion from cellular membranes by methyl- β-cyclodextrin treatment or exogenous addition of cholesterol impaired the ability of B. thailandensis to induce cell-cell fusions. The requirement of physiological cholesterol levels suggests that the membrane organization or mechanical properties of the lipid bilayer influence the fusion process. Altogether, our data suggest that membrane fusion induced by B. pseudomallei and B. thailandensis involves a complex interplay between the T6SS-5 and the host cell.",kc5olmvo

Additionally, marrow ablation, followed by PTH treatment for three months leads to increased cortical thickness. In this study, we sought to determine whether PTH enhances bone formation after marrow ablation in aged rats. Aged rats underwent unilateral femoral marrow ablation and treatment with PTH or vehicle for four weeks. Both femurs from each rat were analyzed by X-ray and pQCT, then analyzed either by microCT, histology or biomechanical testing. Marrow ablation alone induced transient bone formation of low abundance that persisted over four weeks, while marrow ablation followed by PTH induced bone formation of high abundance that also persisted over four weeks. Our data confirms that the osteo-inducive effect of marrow ablation and the additive effect of marrow ablation, followed by PTH, occurs in aged rats. Our observations open new avenues of investigations in the field of tissue regeneration. Local marrow ablation, in conjunction with an anabolic agent, might provide a new platform for rapid site-directed bone growth in areas of high bone loss, such as in the hip and wrist, which are subject to fracture.",md0bcflu

CASE A 90-year-old female with chronic atrial fibrillation had a sudden onset of abdominal pain and hematochezia due to acute embolic occlusion at the origin of the SMA. Computed tomographic findings showed reversible bowel wall ischemia. We performed mechanical thrombectomy using the Solitaire FR revascularization device, a self-expanding and fully retrievable stent-based thrombectomy system for acute intracranial large artery occlusion, combined with manual aspiration through a 6F guiding sheath placed at the SMA origin via a right brachial approach. Prompt and complete recanalization of the SMA was obtained without distal embolism, and intestinal necrosis was avoided. CONCLUSION Combined endovascular procedures of mechanical thrombectomy using the Solitaire FR with thromboaspiration may allow prompt recanalization, clot removal, and prevention of distal embolism and therefore would be a new therapy for acute embolic occlusion at the origin of the SMA.",d0x23frk

The virus is spread by droplet infection and has a high virulence, so any intervention that generates airway aerosol formation potentially endangers the health of those involved in care. Severe forms of coronavirus infection are associated with progressive respiratory failure, for the treatment of which early endotracheal intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation are essential. There is an increased risk of airway aerosol formation during intubation, resulting in a high risk of infection for care personnel. In addition to the above, difficult airway insurance is relatively common in these patients. The aim of our article is to provide a practice-oriented overview of the specialties of airway insurance in patients infected with coronavirus, with particular reference to aspects of infection control and patient safety.

To determine whether this phenomenon is shared by other herpesviruses, we investigated the effects of IFNs on human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) replication. RESULTS: We have found that as with HSV-1, IFN-γ synergizes with the innate IFNs (IFN-α/β) to potently inhibit HCMV replication in vitro. While pre-treatment of human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) with IFN-α, IFN-β or IFN-γ alone inhibited HCMV plaque formation by ~30 to 40-fold, treatment with IFN-α and IFN-γ or IFN-β and IFN-γ inhibited HCMV plaque formation by 163- and 662-fold, respectively. The generation of isobole plots verified that the observed inhibition of HCMV plaque formation and replication in HFFs by IFN-α/β and IFN-γ was a synergistic interaction. Additionally, real-time PCR analyses of the HCMV immediate early (IE) genes (IE1 and IE2) revealed that IE mRNA expression was profoundly decreased in cells stimulated with IFN-α/β and IFN-γ (~5-11-fold) as compared to vehicle-treated cells. Furthermore, decreased IE mRNA expression was accompanied by a decrease in IE protein expression, as demonstrated by western blotting and immunofluorescence. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that IFN-α/β and IFN-γ synergistically inhibit HCMV replication through a mechanism that may involve the regulation of IE gene expression. We hypothesize that IFN-γ produced by activated cells of the adaptive immune response may potentially synergize with endogenous type I IFNs to inhibit HCMV dissemination in vivo.",m9rg6d3w

Management of PJI is dependent upon accurate diagnosis and successful treatment, both of which are challenging. Recently, great strides have been made in improving the diagnosis of PJI, which has no 'gold standard' diagnostic tool. Proper diagnosis is essential as untreated or undetected PJI can quickly lead to biofilm formation on the implant surface depending upon the infecting organism. Upon complete biofilm formation, successful treatment requires prosthetic resection with immediate or delayed reimplantation. Even with the most aggressive surgical treatment, PJI eradication currently has a success rate of approximately 80%.

Axillary lymph nodes dissection represents the treatment of choice in locally advanced breast cancer for prognostic and curative purposes. Seroma formation, an abnormal collection of fluid in the dead space of the axilla, is described in Literature with a wide range of incidence (3-85%). It is a source of significant morbidity and discomfort. The aim of the study is to compare the different haemostasis devices used in breast surgery, investigating the eventual superiority of an instrument among the others in terms of intraoperative and postoperative outcome, especially of seroma formation. METHODS Clinical cases of female patients undergone axillary lymph nodes dissection for local advanced breast cancer between January 2013 and July 2017 at the Surgery Unit of University of Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"" were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided into four groups, according to device utilized during surgery: Electrocautery, Harmonic Scalpel, LigaSure and Thunderbeat. All patients underwent II level axillary lymph nodes dissection associated to radical mastectomy or quadrantectomy. RESULTS One hundred consecutives patients were enrolled in the study. Intra-operative blood loss resulted statistically significant different (P < 0,01) between the Electrocautery group (94,7 ml) and the Thunderbeat group (57,2 ml), while the Harmonic Scalpel group and the Ligasure group, despite presented a lower amount of blood loss, did not differ significantly. Drainage volume resulted significantly lower (P = 0,002) in the comparison between the Electrocautery group and the Thunderbeat group; the Ligasure group and Harmonic Scapel group showed no difference between them and Electrocautery group. About the seroma formation, the Electrocautery group resulted affected by the highest seroma formation rate (64%). Seroma incidence in Harmonic Scalpel group was 24%, in Ligasure group was 44%, while Thunderbeat group showed the lowest presentation of seroma with 16%. CONCLUSIONS In patients affected by breast cancer requiring axillary lymphnodes dissection, the use of advanced hemostasis devices is highly desirable. Among the non-traditional tools, Thunderbeat resulted to be superior in terms of reduction of intra-operative blood loss and post-operative drainage output, moreover associated to a substantial reduction of postoperative seroma incidence.",sleo01nx

however, other possible functions of PSGs have yet to be explored. We have observed that PSGs induce transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1), which among its other diverse functions inhibits T-cell function and has proangiogenic properties. The present study investigates a potential role for PSG1, the most abundant PSG in maternal serum, as a possible inducer of proangiogenic growth factors known to play an important role in establishment of the vasculature at the maternal-fetal interface. To this end, we measured TGFB1, vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) A and C, and placental growth factor (PGF) protein levels in several cell types after PSG1 treatment. In addition, tube formation and wound healing assays were performed to investigate a possible direct interaction between PSG1 and endothelial cells. PSG1 induced up-regulation of both TGFB1 and VEGFA in human monocytes, macrophages, and two human extravillous trophoblast cell lines. We did not observe induction of VEGFC or PGF by PSG1 in any of the cells tested. PSG1 treatment resulted in endothelial tube formation in the presence and absence of VEGFA. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to map the essential regions within the N-domain of PSG1 required for functional activity. We found that the aspartic acid at position 95, previously believed to be required for binding of PSGs to cells, is not required for PSG1 activity but that the amino acids implicated in the formation of a salt bridge within the N-domain are essential for PSG1 function.",k2vbgqk7

This preclinical study compares the behavior of a new mesh (Parietex composite ventral patch [Ptx]) with that of two existing meshes used for ventral hernia repair. MATERIALS AND METHODS Fifty-four New Zealand White rabbits (3000 g) were used in an experimental model of umbilical hernia repair (diameter 1.5 cm). The materials tested were: Ventralex ST hernia patch (Vent) (Bard Davol Inc, Warwick, RI) (n = 18); Proceed ventral patch (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ) (PVP) (n = 18) and Ptx (Covidien, Sofradim, Trevoux, France) (n = 18). At 3, 7, 14 d, and 6 wk after implant, peritoneal behavior and adhesion formation were assessed by sequential laparoscopy. Mesh mesothelial cover was determined by scanning electron microscopy. Host tissue ingrowth (collagens I and III) and the macrophage response were assessed by immunohistochemical labeling. Animals were euthanized at 2, 6 wk, and 6 mo after surgery. Data were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS Adhesion formation from 3 d-6 wk was significantly greater (P < 0.05) for PVP compared with Vent or Ptx. Three encapsulated PVP implants showed ""tissue-integrated"" adhesions affecting the intestinal loops. All three implant types showed similar patterns of collagen l and III deposition. The PVP mesh elicited the greater macrophage response both at 2 wk and 6 mo. CONCLUSIONS Ptx and Vent showed excellent mesothelialization, which led to minimum adhesion formation. The appropriate tissue integration of Ptx in the parietal neoperitoneum is likely attributable to its deployment system.",effxxqqh

We first determined that RSV infection activates PKR which induces the phosphorylation of eIF2α, resulting in the formation of host stress granules. We used RNA interference to decrease endogenous PKR levels. RSV replication was not altered in cells deficient for PKR expression. However, RSV-mediated stress granule formation was significantly reduced in PKR-knockdown cells. As an alternative method to block PKR activation, we used treatment with the kinase inhibitor 2-aminopurine (2-AP). We observed that 2-AP treatment significantly reduced viral replication. We also treated PKR-knockdown cells with 2-AP and inoculated with RSV. Under these conditions, 2-AP treatment diminished viral replication in the absence of PKR expression. These results suggest that PKR activation has a minimal effect on RSV replication and that the antiviral effect of 2-AP during RSV infection likely occurs via a PKR-independent mechanism.",iw3g18s5

Nevertheless, recent studies have shown that ORS with HCO3(-) ≤ 62 mmol/L do not interfere with abomasal milk clotting in healthy calves. However, in diarrheic calves, feeding ORS and milk simultaneously may disturb abomasal curd formation and exacerbate diarrhea due to faster abomasal passage of ingesta. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to ultrasonographically examine abomasal milk clotting and diameter after feeding milk and milk replacer (MR) with and without ORS to healthy and diarrheic calves. Abomasal curd formation and diameter in healthy and diarrheic calves were ultrasonographically imaged before and after feeding milk, MR and ORS prepared in milk or MR. Feeding mixtures of milk or MR with ORS did not cause any remarkable differences in the ultrasonographic images of abomasal content. Moreover, abomasal milk clotting was not disturbed due to diarrhea. Statistically significant differences of abomasal diameter after feeding between healthy and diarrheic calves indicated that abomasal emptying is delayed in diarrheic calves. Hence, further studies are needed to determine reasons for decelerated abomasal passage in calves suffering from diarrhea.",7eziejv0

atherosclerotic plaque formation,"CD9, a 24 kDa tetraspanin membrane protein, is known to regulate cell adhesion and migration, cancer progression and metastasis, immune and allergic responses, and viral infection. CD9 is upregulated in senescent endothelial cells, neointima hyperplasia, and atherosclerotic plaques. However, its role in cellular senescence and atherosclerosis remains undefined. We investigated the potential mechanism for CD9-mediated cellular senescence and its role in atherosclerotic plaque formation. CD9 knockdown in senescent human umbilical vein endothelial cells significantly rescued senescence phenotypes, while CD9 upregulation in young cells accelerated senescence. CD9 regulated cellular senescence through a phosphatidylinositide 3 kinase-AKT-mTOR-p53 signal pathway. CD9 expression increased in arterial tissues from humans and rats with age, and in atherosclerotic plaques in humans and mice. Anti-mouse CD9 antibody noticeably prevented the formation of atherosclerotic lesions in ApoE-/- mice and Ldlr-/- mice. Furthermore, CD9 ablation in ApoE-/- mice decreased atherosclerotic lesions in aorta and aortic sinus. These results suggest that CD9 plays critical roles in endothelial cell senescence and consequently the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, implying that CD9 is a novel target for prevention and treatment of vascular aging and atherosclerosis.",5i4ok433

Here, we demonstrate that CD13 controls endothelial cell invasion in response to the serum peptide bradykinin by facilitating signal transduction at the level of the plasma membrane. Inhibition of CD13 abrogates bradykinin B(2) receptor internalization, leading to the attenuation of downstream events such as bradykinin-induced activation of Cdc42 and filopodia formation, and thus affects endothelial cell motility. Investigation into mechanisms underlying this block led us to focus on B(2)R internalization via membrane-dependent mechanisms. Membrane disruption by depletion of cholesterol or trypsinization halts B(2)R internalization, invasion, and filopodia formation, which can be recovered with addition of cholesterol. However, this functional recovery is severely impaired in the presence of CD13 antagonists, and the distribution of membrane proteins is disordered in treated cells, suggesting a role for CD13 in plasma membrane protein organization. Finally, exogenous expression of wild-type but not mutant CD13 further alters protein distribution, suggesting peptidase activity is required for CD13's regulatory activity. Therefore, CD13 functions as a novel modulator of signal transduction and cell motility via its influence on specific plasma membrane organization, thus regulating angiogenesis.",jc2v11gu

We review recent studies dealing with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in kidney disease and hypertension, and discuss the potential therapeutic benefit of increasing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 activity in the treatment of these diseases. RECENT FINDINGS In glomeruli from diabetic mice, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 expression is downregulated, and pharmacological inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 leads to worsening of albuminuria, increased mesangial matrix deposition and fibronectin expression. The deletion of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 gene in mice leads to worsening of angiotensin II-induced hypertension and has also been shown to cause glomerulosclerosis in aging male mice. SUMMARY Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a key enzyme in the renin-angiotensin system that favors the degradation of angiotensin I and angiotensin II. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 inhibition by pharmacological means and by genetic deletion worsens kidney disease in diabetic mice. Strategies geared to increasing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 activity may provide a novel therapeutic target within the renin-angiotensin system by enhancing angiotensin II degradation that may complement the current approach of inhibiting angiotensin II formation and action. Amplifying angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 activity may have a potential therapeutic role for kidney disease and hypertension.",w1w5f5ko

Markers for nonrecanalization in acute stroke have been reported for intravenous tissue plasminogen activator; however, similar predictors are not known for endovascular therapy. We sought to identify predictors and outcomes associated with rescue therapy in the SWIFT trial. METHODS Rescue therapy included the use of an alternative device, agent, or maneuver following failure to recanalize with three retrieval attempts using the initial device. Clinical, angiographic, and demographic data was reviewed. RESULTS Among a total of 144 patients enrolled, 43 (29.9%) required rescue therapy. We used the same baseline demographics for patients with and without rescue therapy. Rescue therapy was used in a higher percentage of patients randomized to the Merci group compared with the Solitaire group (43 vs. 21%, p = 0.009). Patients with rescue therapy experienced a longer recanalization time (p < 0.001), a lower percentage of successful recanalization (p < 0.001), and a lower percentage of good outcome (p = 0.009). In multivariate analysis, patients randomized to the Merci group (OR 3.99, 95% CI 1.58, 10.10) and age >80 years (OR 3.51, 95% CI 1.06, 11.64) were predictors of rescue therapy. CONCLUSIONS Merci treatment group and age were predictors of rescue therapy, while a trend toward an increased need of rescue therapy was observed with hypertension and proximal clot location. Rescue therapy was associated with fewer good outcomes. These findings may reflect targets for improvement in endovascular therapy.",p7wndi7n

To probe the action of biochar on soil aggregates, a 5-year field experiment was implemented in the brown earth soil of northeastern China. We determined the aggregate distribution (> 2000 μm, 250-2000 μm, 53-250 μm, and < 53 μm) and organic carbon (OC) and organo-mineral complex contents both in the topsoil (0-20 cm) and within the soil aggregates. Three treatments were studied as follows: control (basal application of mineral NPK fertilizer), biochar (biochar applied at a rate of 2.625 t ha-1), and stover (maize stover applied at a rate of 7.5 t ha-1), and all treatments received the same fertilization. The biochar and stover applications decreased the soil bulk and particle densities significantly (p < 0.05) and enhanced the soil total porosity. Both amendments significantly (p < 0.05) enhanced the total OC, heavy OC fractions, and organo-mineral complex quantities in the bulk soil as well as in all the studied aggregate fractions. Biochar and stover applications promoted the formation of small macroaggregates. A greater amount of organic matter was contained in the macroaggregates, which led to the formation of more organo-mineral complexes, thereby improving soil aggregate stability. However, the different mechanisms underlying the effect of biochar and stover on organo-mineral complexes need further research. Biochar and stover applications are both effective methods of improving the soil structure in Northeast China.",rkpk366y

health threat of the twenty-first century. To properly address this crisis with both robust testing and novel treatments, we require a deep understanding of the life cycle of the causative agent, the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Here, we examine the architecture and self-assembly properties of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein, which packages viral RNA into new virions. We determined a 1.4 [A] resolution crystal structure of this proteins N2b domain, revealing a compact, intertwined dimer similar to that of related coronaviruses including SARS-CoV. While the N2b domain forms a dimer in solution, addition of the C-terminal spacer B/N3 domain mediates formation of a homotetramer. Using hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, we find evidence that at least part of this putatively disordered domain is structured, potentially forming an -helix that self-associates and cooperates with the N2b domain to mediate tetramer formation. Finally, we map the locations of amino acid substitutions in the N protein from over 38,000 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences. We find that these substitutions are strongly clustered in the proteins N2a linker domain, and that substitutions within the N1b and N2b domains cluster away from their functional RNA binding and dimerization interfaces. Overall, this work reveals the architecture and self-assembly properties of a key protein in the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle, with implications for both drug design and antibody-based testing.",D3C9DFE8

We sought to identify prognostic parameters for clinical and radiological outcome after mechanical thrombectomy. METHODS In 34 patients (age 72 ± 13 years, 64.7% women) with acute occlusion of the distal ICA and/or M1 segment who were treated with mechanical thrombectomy, the Spearman correlation was performed to assess potential prognostic outcome parameters (age, NIHSS, ASPECT, thrombus length (TL), clot burden score (CBS), relative filling time delay (rFTD), time to recanalization (TTR) and TICI score). The modified Rankin scale (mRS) and the Alberta Stroke Program Early CT (ASPECT) score were used for clinical and radiological outcome, respectively. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to assess parameters predicting favorable clinical (ΔmRS ≤ 2) and radiological outcome (ΔASPECT ≤ 2). RESULTS Variables associated with favorable clinical outcome included NIHSS, TL, TTR and TICI score (p ≤ 0.01) with NIHSS ≤ 15 (p = 0.001, area under the curve (AUC) 0.87), TL ≤ 2 cm (p = 0.017, AUC 0.75), TTR ≤ 231 min (p = 0.001 AUC 0.88) and TICI ≥ 2b (p = 0.050, AUC 0.70). Shorter TTR and higher TICI scores were associated with favorable radiological outcome (p < 0.001) with TTR ≤ 224 min (p = 0.023, AUC 0.77) and TICI ≥ 2b (p = 0.000, AUC 0.86). CONCLUSION Fast and complete recanalization is essential to achieve a favorable radiological and functional outcome after mechanical thrombectomy in acute ischemic stroke. Age, CBS and collateral supply play a subordinate role.",meusedic

Moreover, treatment with licochalcone A and isoliquiritigenin as the active components, whose contents are increased by the roasting process, remarkably suppressed RANKL-induced osteoclast formation in BMMs, respectively. Furthermore, orally administered rLE substantially blocked tumor growth and bone destruction in mice inoculated with breast cancer cells in the tibiae. Serum levels of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase and C-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type I collagen and trabecular bone morphometric parameters were reversed to almost the same levels as the control mice by the rLE treatment. In conclusion, rLE may be a beneficial agent for preventing and treating bone destruction in patients with breast cancer.",gaj5d8iu

It has been shown that N-terminal portion of the Annexin A1 protein (AnxA1) with its anti-inflammatory properties induces epithelial mucosa repair and presents potential therapeutic approaches. The role of AnxA1 on wound healing has not been explored and we investigated in this study the effect of the peptide Ac2-26 (N-terminal AnxA1 peptide Ac2-26; AnxA12-26) on heterologous skin scaffolds transplantation in BALB/c mice, focusing on inflammation and angiogenesis. Treatment with AnxA12-26, once a day, from day 3-60 after scaffold implantation improved the take of the implant, induced vessels formation, enhanced gene and protein levels of the vascular growth factor-A (VEGF-A) and fibroblast influx into allograft tissue. It also decreased pro- while increasing anti-inflammatory cytokines. The pro-angiogenic activity of AnxA12-26 was corroborated by topical application of AnxA12-26 on the subcutaneous tissue of mice. Moreover, treatment of human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVECs) with AnxA12-26 improved proliferation, shortened cycle, increased migration and actin polymerization similarly to those evoked by VEGF-A. The peptide treatment instead only potentiated the tube formation induced by VEGF-A.

DESIGN Prospective study. SETTING Hokkaido University Hospital. PATIENTS Forty-two consecutive Japanese patients who had been treated for a total of 48 clefts according to a strict clinical protocol. Mean age at bone grafting was 6 years 11 months. INTERVENTIONS Bone grafting was performed by harvesting lateral cortical bone plates from the symphysis and/or body and then placing them on the labial and palatal openings of the alveolar process defect. No particulate bone grafts were packed into the bony cavity. Mean follow-up after bone grafting was 37 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Status of the grafted area and eruption of cleft-adjacent teeth were assessed prospectively using computed tomography and periapical radiography. RESULTS At 6 months postoperatively, computed tomography showed sufficient bone bridge formation at the cleft site in 85.4% of clefts. Periapical radiography showed ≥75% of the root surfaces of cleft-adjacent teeth were covered with spanning bone in 83.3% of clefts. In 92.6% of clefts in which the cleft-adjacent canine was uncovered with bone during follow-up, the canines erupted spontaneously. CONCLUSIONS Monocortical mandibular bone grafting appears extremely effective for sufficient bone bridge formation and facilitation of cleft-adjacent teeth eruption. The procedure is advantageous in that the quantity of bone required per unit volume of cleft defect is relatively reduced, and larger clefts can thus be treated.",5angv31s

We assessed the incidence of hepatic abscess after thermal ablation in a BEA cohort treated with extended antibiotic regimens following ablation. MATERIALS AND METHODS Retrospective review was performed to identify patients with BEA who underwent percutaneous hepatic thermal ablation between January 1, 2003-September 1, 2016. Fifteen patients with BEA underwent 18 percutaneous thermal ablation procedures. Patient and procedural characteristics were reviewed, as well as the antibiotic regiment utilized post ablation. Complications were characterized via standardized nomenclature [Common Terminology for Clinically Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.03]. RESULTS Fifteen patients with BEA underwent treatment of 49 liver lesions during 18 ablation sessions. Mean follow-up in these patients was 39 months (range 3-138 months). Two patients (11%) developed hepatic abscesses, both of which occurred within 45 days of the ablation procedure while the patients were still on extended prophylactic antibiotic therapy. No additional CTCAE clinically significant complications were observed. CONCLUSION Thermal ablation of hepatic tumors can be accomplished safely in patients with BEA. Long-term post-procedural antibiotics may mitigate the risk of hepatic abscess formation.

Feasibility, safety and outcome of EVT in a-ICAD are not well described yet. METHODS From an institutional database, we retrospectively selected consecutive patients treated for a-ICAD between January 2007 and July 2015. We assessed recanalization results defining <50 % residual stenosis and mTICI ≥2b as successful. Procedural adverse events and symptomatic haemorrhages were reported as well as clinical outcome at 90 days defining a mRS ≤2 as favourable. Follow-up angiographies were reviewed and retreatments reported. RESULTS In the defined period, 73 patients (mean age 48 years (31-73), mean NIHSS 11 (0-27)) received EVT for a-ICAD. The majority (60 %) had tandem occlusions. Cervical artery reconstruction was successful in 100 % and intracranial thrombectomy in 85 %. Thrombus formation (18 %) and thromboembolism (20 %) were the most frequent adverse events but clinically relevant only in 8 %. Symptomatic haemorrhage occurred in 5 %. Clinical outcome was favourable in 64 %, with a lower chance after tandem occlusion (55 vs. 79 %, p = 0.047). Death rate was 10 %. None of the patients developed recurrent ischaemic symptoms, but control angiography revealed abnormal findings of the reconstructed ICA in 38 % leading to retreatment in 17 %. CONCLUSION EVT of a-ICAD is feasible with a predominantly favourable clinical outcome. Improvement of devices and techniques is warranted to reduce the risk of thrombus formation and thromboembolism during treatment and insufficient vessel wall healing thereafter.",dnykmbk8

While treatment of Vero E6 cells with 100 U/ml of either IFN-β or IFN-γ marginally reduced viral replication, treatment with both IFN-β and IFN-γ inhibited SARS-CoV plaque formation by 30-fold and replication by 3000-fold at 24 h and by > 1 × 10(5)-fold at 48 and 72 h post-infection.

Zika virus (ZIKV) is the pathogen that causes Zika viral disease, and it is a mosquito-borne virus. However, its pathogenesis, especially the interaction between ZIKV and target cells during the early stages of infection, is still unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that infecting human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) with ZIKV triggers cellular autophagy. We observed both an increase in the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II and increased accumulation of fluorescent cells with LC3 dots, which are considered to be the two key indicators of autophagy. The ratio of LC3-II/GAPDH in each group was significantly increased at different times after ZIKV infection at different MOIs, indicating that the production of lipidated LC3-II increased. Moreover, both the ratio of LC3-II/GAPDH and the expression of viral NS3 protein increased with increasing time of viral infection. The expression level of p62 decreased gradually from 12 h post-infection. Expression profile of double fluorescent protein labelling LC3 indicated that the autophagy induced by ZIKV infection was a complete process. We further investigated the role of autophagy in ZIKV replication. We demonstrated that either the treatment with inhibitors of autophagosomes formation or short hairpin RNA targeting the Beclin-1 gene, which is critical for the formation of autophagosomes, significantly reduced viral production. Taken together, our results indicate that ZIKV infection induces autophagy of HUVEC, and inhibition of ZIKV-induced autophagy restrains viral replication.",8iq93l2n

The thermal process was analyzed by a thermogravimetric analyzer coupled with a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. The evolution of physicochemical characteristics of PCMs was studied. The photothermal conversion and solar steam generation performances of the optimal sample (PCM(Fe/600)) were evaluated. The adsorption properties of PCM(Fe/600) for methylene blue (MB) were investigated. Results showed that Fe(3+) promoted the breaking of cellulose chains in WCCB, leading to the occurrence of pyrolysis of WCCB at lower temperatures and the reduction of activation energy by 76.63 kJ mol(−1). Char yield raised because volatile radicals were captured by FeCl(3)-derived amorphous Fe(III) species, then involved in char formation. Amorphous Fe(III) continuously converted into Fe(3)O(4) crystallites with carbonization temperature increasing from 400 to 700 °C, then α-Fe was formed at 800 °C via the carbothermal reduction of Fe(3)O(4). FeCl(3) was favorable to the formation of a developed microporous structure. Surface area significantly increased with carbonization temperature increasing from 400 to 600 °C due to the removal of volatiles. The etching of carbon by Fe(3)O(4) above 700 °C also led to the increase of surface area. PCM(Fe/600) exhibited higher optical absorption than other samples due to its high graphite degree and porosity. It also had excellent photothermal performance; thus, solar steam yield was 1.46 times that of the pure water with the assistance of PCM(Fe/600). PCM(Fe/600) in floating state was effective in adsorption of MB from water. Besides, the adsorption behavior fitted Langmuir model with a monolayer adsorption capacity reached up to 70.9 mg g(−1).",j24ylmwn

Therefore the main purpose of the present study was to investigate the anticancer effects of glycyrrhizinic acid in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The MTT assay was used to evaluate the anticancer effects while a clonogenic assay was used to study its effects on colony formation tendency. Flow cytometry was used to study the effects on cell cycle phase distribution and apoptosis. Western blot assay was used to study changes in protein expression of the m-TOR/PI3K/Akt pathway. RESULTS: The results indicated that glycyrrhizinic acid caused significant (p < 0.01). The growth inhibitory effects MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. The growth inhibitory effects of glycyrrhizinic acid exhibited concentration-dependent as well as time-dependent growth inhibitory trend. Different doses of glycyrrhizinic acid had a tendency to significantly (p < 0.01) inhibit the colony formation tendency of MCF-7 cells. As compared to the control group, glycyrrhizinic acid-treated cells showed a high percentage of apoptotic cells. Cells treated with a 10, 50 and 100 µM dose of glycyrrhizinic acid led to a 24.3%, 41.5% and 82.1% increase in the sub-G1 phase (apoptotic) cells. Glycyrrhizinic acid also led to significant (p < 0.01) inhibition of cell invasion along with downregulation of m-TOR/PI3K/Akt protein expression. CONCLUSIONS: Glycyrrhizinic acid inhibited MCF-7 human breast cancer cell growth and therefore may prove essential lead molecule in the treatment of breast cancer.",88bcvunj

The use of a rigid barrier between the heart and the sharp sternal edges has been successfully tested on pigs. In the present article, we demonstrate increased safety in NPWT through the use of the HeartShield device. METHODS Six patients were treated with a specially designed device in combination with NPWT. The device consists of a horizontally placed disk covered in foam. The back of the T-shaped device sticks up between the sternal edges and up above skin level. This part of the device is also covered in foam. Drainage is performed through two holes at the top of the device. The device and foam are changed every second to third day, and -120 mm Hg of continuous therapy is used. Six patients were treated with traditional NPWT, serving as control group. RESULTS No signs of calluslike formation were seen on the right ventricle in the group treated with the HeartShield device. In the conventional NPWT control group, all six patients had calluslike formation (>1 × 2 cm2) on the anterior part of the right ventricle. All patients in the HeartShield group had grade 1 epicardial petechial bleeding (<0.5 cm2) on the right ventricle. In the control group, one patient had grade 1 (<0.5 cm2), three patients had grade 2 (0.5-2.0 cm2), and two patients had grade 3 (>2.0 cm2) epicardial petechial bleeding on the right ventricle. No major bleeding or mortality was observed in either group during the course of the study. CONCLUSIONS The use of the HeartShield device significantly minimizes the contact between the right ventricle and the sternal edges, thereby decreasing the risk for life-threatening complications due to bleeding.",r2c2p4pa

In real societies, it is expected that these two processes depend on and affect each other. However, little is known about the effects of opinion dynamics over disease dynamics and vice versa, since most studies treat them separately. In this work we study the dynamics of the voter model for opinion formation intertwined with that of the contact process for disease spreading, in a population of agents that interact via two types of connections, social and contact. These two interacting dynamics take place on two layers of networks, coupled through a fraction [Formula: see text] of links present in both networks. The probability that an agent updates its state depends on both the opinion and disease states of the interacting partner. We find that the opinion dynamics has striking consequences on the statistical properties of disease spreading. The most important is that the smooth (continuous) transition from a healthy to an endemic phase observed in the contact process, as the infection probability increases beyond a threshold, becomes abrupt (discontinuous) in the two-layer system. Therefore, disregarding the effects of social dynamics on epidemics propagation may lead to a misestimation of the real magnitude of the spreading. Also, an endemic-healthy discontinuous transition is found when the coupling [Formula: see text] overcomes a threshold value. Furthermore, we show that the disease dynamics delays the opinion consensus, leading to a consensus time that varies nonmonotonically with [Formula: see text] in a large range of the model's parameters. A mean-field approach reveals that the coupled dynamics of opinions and disease can be approximately described by the dynamics of the voter model decoupled from that of the contact process, with effective probabilities of opinion and disease transmission.",wqvn85z2

This study aimed to assess the prognostic value of a new radiological score: the Basilar Artery on Computed Tomography Angiography (BATMAN) score. METHODS A retrospective analysis of consecutive stroke patients with basilar artery occlusion diagnosed on computed tomographic angiography was performed. BATMAN score is a 10-point computed tomographic angiography-based grading system which incorporates thrombus burden and the presence of collaterals. Reliability was assessed with intraclass coefficient correlation. Good outcome was defined as modified Rankin Scale score of ≤3 at 3 months and successful reperfusion as thrombolysis in cerebral infarction 2b-3. BATMAN score was externally validated and compared with the Posterior Circulation Collateral score. RESULTS The derivation cohort included 83 patients with 41 in the validation cohort. In receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, BATMAN score had an area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.81 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.7-0.9) in derivation cohort and an area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.74 (95% CI, 0.6-0.9) in validation cohort. In logistic regression adjusted for age and clinical severity, BATMAN score of <7 was associated with poor outcome in derivation cohort (odds ratio, 5.5; 95% CI, 1.4-21; P=0.01), in validation cohort (odds ratio, 6.9; 95% CI, 1.4-33; P=0.01), and in endovascular patients, after adjustment for recanalization and time to treatment (odds ratio, 4.8; 95% CI, 1.2-18; P=0.01). BATMAN score of <7 was not associated with recanalization. Interrater agreement was substantial (intraclass coefficient correlation, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.8-0.9). BATMAN score had greater accuracy compared with Posterior Circulation Collateral score (P=0.04). CONCLUSIONS The addition of collateral quality to clot burden in BATMAN score seems to improve prognostic accuracy in basilar artery occlusion patients.",gkkoupcm

The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of autologous PRP on the osteogenic potential of combining bovine porous bone mineral (BPBM) and bio-guide membrane (BGM) in promoting mandible bicortical bony defects in rabbits. METHODS One circular mandible bicortical bony defects were created in each of 54 rabbits, which were divided into 3 groups: group 1: 18 of the defects were left unfilled as a negative control; group 2: 18 of the defects were grafted with autologous PRP and BPBM/BGM; group 3: 18 of the defects were grafted with BPBM/BGM without PRP. Animals were killed at 4, 8, and 12 weeks after operation. Harvested tissue and specimens were evaluated histologically and radiographically, and metabolized observation was performed. Histological parameters associated with osteoblast activities, bone trabecula, neovascularization, newly formed mineralized bone, rudimental grafts and connective tissue formation were measured. Densities of the bones at 4, 8, and 12 weeks were studied by radiographic. The bone defect closure ratio was measured at 12 weeks. The bone metabolized parameter alkaline phosphatase was also measured and compared between 4, 8, and 12 weeks. RESULTS The platelet concentration of PRP is 4.19- to 4.43-fold to that of the whole blood. Histological analysis showed new bone formation at all therapeutic sites including BPBM/BGM grafts with or without PRP. A statistically significant difference in new bone formation between group PRP/BPBM/BGM and group BPBM/BGM was observed. Untreated defects of group control showed the less bone regeneration. There was significant difference of bone density between group PRP/BPBM/BGM and control, and group BPBM/BGM and control, at 4, 8, and 12 weeks postoperative. There were more bone defects filling, and the grafts were absorbed at 12 weeks of group PRP/BPBM/BGM compared with group BPBM/BGM. Defects treated with PRP/BPBM/BGM demonstrated significantly increased activity of osteoblasts, enhanced amount of mitochondria and rough endoplasmic reticulum in osteoblasts, and increased concentration of alkaline phosphatase at 4, 8, and 12 weeks compared with those treated with BPBM/BGM and control group. Complete closure ratio of bone defects treated with PRP/BPBM/BGM (50%) was significantly increased compared with that treated with BPBM/BGM (16.6%). CONCLUSIONS The study suggested that PRP combination of BPBM and BGM had significant therapeutic effects on mandible bicortical bony defects of rabbits. The effects are associated with the high concentration of platelet in PRP and the porous configuration of BPBM. Although we cannot reveal the detailed statistical relationship of PRP on promoting BPBM/GBM osteoinductive effects, PRP demonstrated superior results of bone regeneration.",l12ehxjv

The added benefit of intra-arterial treatment might be less in these patients. The aim of this exploratory post hoc analysis was to assess the relation of CBS with neurological improvement and endovascular treatment effect. METHODS For 499 of 500 patients in the MR CLEAN study (Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands), the CBS was determined. Ordinal logistic regression models with and without main baseline prognostic variables were used to assess the association between CBS (continuous or dichotomized at CBS of 6) and a shift toward better outcome on the modified Rankin Scale. The model without main baseline prognostic variables only included treatment allocation and CBS. Models with and without a multiplicative interaction term of CBS and treatment were compared using the χ2 test to assess treatment effect modification by CBS. RESULTS Higher CBS was associated with a shift toward better outcome on the modified Rankin Scale; adjusted common odds ratio per point CBS was 1.12 (95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.20]. Dichotomized CBS had an adjusted common odds ratio of 1.67 (95% confidence interval, 1.12-2.51). Both effect estimates were slightly attenuated by adding baseline prognostic variables. The addition of the interaction terms did not significantly improve the fit of the models. There was a small and insignificant increase of intra-arterial treatment efficacy in the high CBS group. CONCLUSIONS A higher CBS is associated with improved outcome and may be used as a prognostic marker. We found no evidence that CBS modifies the effect of intra-arterial treatment.

Because coronavirus spike glycoproteins (S) mediate virus entry, affect viral host range, and elicit neutralizing antibodies, analyzing the functions of MERS-CoV S protein is a high research priority. MERS-CoV S on lentivirus pseudovirions mediated entry into a variety of cell types including embryo cells from New World Eptesicus fuscus bats. Surprisingly, a polyclonal antibody to the S protein of MHV, a group a murine betacoronavirus, cross-reacted in immunoblots with the S2 domain of group c MERS-CoV spike protein. MERS pseudovirions released from 293T cells contained only uncleaved S, and pseudovirus entry was blocked by lysosomotropic reagents NH(4)Cl and bafilomycin and inhibitors of cathepsin L. However, when MERS pseudovirions with uncleaved S protein were adsorbed at 4°C to Vero E6 cells, brief trypsin treatment at neutral pH triggered virus entry at the plasma membrane and syncytia formation. When 293T cells producing MERS pseudotypes co-expressed serine proteases TMPRSS-2 or -4, large syncytia formed at neutral pH, and the pseudovirions produced were non-infectious and deficient in S protein. These experiments show that if S protein on MERS pseudovirions is uncleaved, then viruses enter by endocytosis in a cathepsin L-dependent manner, but if MERS-CoV S is cleaved, either during virus maturation by serine proteases or on pseudovirions by trypsin in extracellular fluids, then viruses enter at the plasma membrane at neutral pH and cause massive syncytia formation even in cells that express little or no MERS-CoV receptor. Thus, whether MERS-CoV enters cells within endosomes or at the plasma membrane depends upon the host cell type and tissue, and is determined by the location of host proteases that cleave the viral spike glycoprotein and activate membrane fusion.",yc8q62z8

There is increasing evidence to support the use of endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) where en-bloc resection and lower recurrence rates may be achieved. However, ESD is associated with deep submucosal dissection when compared to EMR. This may increase the risk of complications including stricture formation with subsequent radiofrequency ablation (RFA) therapy. The aim of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of RFA following EMR and ESD as well as when RFA was used without prior endoscopic resection. The primary outcome measure was complication rates. Clearance of dysplasia (CRD) and clearance of intestinal metaplasia (CRIM) were secondary outcomes. A retrospective analysis of a cohort of 91 patients referred for RFA from a single academic tertiary center was performed. The choice of endoscopic resection method was tailored according to the lesion type and morphology. Focal and circumferential ablation was performed after initial follow up endoscopy postresection. Patients proceeded straight to RFA in the absence of any visible lesions. In this study, the ESD group had a higher proportion of cancers compared to the EMR cohort (74.1% vs. 30.2%, P < 0.01) prior to RFA. All complications post RFA occurred in the groups with previous endoscopic resection. There was no significant difference in the total complication rate (7.4% vs. 9.3%, P = 0.78) and stricture formation rate (3.7% vs. 9.3%, P = 0.38) between the ESD and EMR groups. CRD was achieved in 96.3% in the ESD group, 88.4% in the EMR group, and all patients in the RFA alone group. CRIM rates were similar in the EMR and ESD groups (81.4% vs. 85.2%) but higher in the RFA alone group (90.5%). In conclusion, RFA following ESD is very effective and not associated with an increased risk of complications compared to EMR. This supports the application of RFA in the treatment algorithm of patients undergoing ESD for Barrett's neoplasia.",ag189jm9

The above measures were implemented in many countries during the outbreak.

In surgical patients, intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) reduces the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), but no reliable evidence exists about its effectiveness in patients who have had a stroke. We assessed the effectiveness of IPC to reduce the risk of DVT in patients who have had a stroke. METHODS The CLOTS 3 trial is a multicentre parallel group randomised trial assessing IPC in immobile patients (ie, who cannot walk to the toilet without the help of another person) with acute stroke. We enrolled patients from day 0 to day 3 of admission and allocated them via a central randomisation system (ratio 1:1) to receive either IPC or no IPC. A technician who was masked to treatment allocation did a compression duplex ultrasound (CDU) of both legs at 7-10 days and, wherever practical, at 25-30 days after enrolment. Caregivers and patients were not masked to treatment assignment. Patients were followed up for 6 months to determine survival and later symptomatic venous thromboembolism. The primary outcome was a DVT in the proximal veins detected on a screening CDU or any symptomatic DVT in the proximal veins, confirmed on imaging, within 30 days of randomisation. Patients were analysed according to their treatment allocation. TRIAL REGISTRATION ISRCTN93529999. FINDINGS Between Dec 8, 2008, and Sept 6, 2012, 2876 patients were enrolled in 94 centres in the UK. The included patients were broadly representative of immobile stroke patients admitted to hospital and had a median age of 76 years (IQR 67-84). The primary outcome occurred in 122 (8·5%) of 1438 patients allocated IPC and 174 (12·1%) of 1438 patients allocated no IPC; an absolute reduction in risk of 3·6% (95% CI 1·4-5·8). Excluding the 323 patients who died before any primary outcome and 41 without any screening CDU, the adjusted OR for the comparison of 122 of 1267 patients vs 174 of 1245 patients was 0·65 (95% CI 0·51-0·84; p=0·001). Deaths in the treatment period occurred in 156 (11%) patients allocated IPC and 189 (13%) patients allocated no IPC died within the 30 days of treatment period (p=0·057); skin breaks on the legs were reported in 44 (3%) patients allocated IPC and in 20 (1%) patients allocated no IPC (p=0·002); falls with injury were reported in 33 (2%) patients in the IPC group and in 24 (2%) patients in the no-IPC group (p=0·221). INTERPRETATION IPC is an effective method of reducing the risk of DVT and possibly improving survival in a wide variety of patients who are immobile after stroke.

METHODS Five cadaveric shoulders were subjected to different loading conditions in both the superior and anterosuperior directions in the intact state, with the supraspinatus cut and with sequentially larger anterosuperior rotator cuff tears. RESULTS Isolated tears of the supraspinatus had no significant biomechanical consequences under any condition tested. Anterosuperior translation was greater than superior translation in the intact specimen and for every combination of anterosuperior rotator cuff defect. With the supraspinatus and the superior half of the subscapularis (i.e., the anterior cable attachment) released, there was no significant increase in anterosuperior or superior glenohumeral translation in response to lower loading conditions (10 to 20 N). At higher loading conditions (40 to 50 N), tears of the supraspinatus and superior half of the subscapularis led to significantly increased translation in both directions. CONCLUSIONS Simulated anterosuperior rotator cuff tears involving the superior half of the subscapularis significantly alter shoulder biomechanics and lead to increased anterosuperior and superior glenohumeral translation under higher loads. The anterior attachment of the rotator cuff cable is therefore an important determinant of the biomechanics of anterosuperior rotator cuff tears at higher loads but not at lower loads. Preserving the inferior half of the subscapularis was sufficient to maintain relatively normal shoulder kinematics under lower loading conditions. Tears of the entire subscapularis altered glenohumeral kinematics at essentially all loads. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Knowledge of the biomechanics of anterosuperior rotator cuff tears enhances our understanding of how to best treat these lesions.",hehd9v5u

Gram-negative bloodstream infections (GNBSIs) harboring such difficult-to-treat resistance (DTR) may have higher mortality than phenotypes that allow for ≥1 active first-line antibiotic. Methods The Premier Database was analyzed for inpatients with select GNBSIs. DTR was defined as intermediate/resistant in vitro to all ß-lactam categories, including carbapenems and fluoroquinolones. Prevalence and aminoglycoside resistance of DTR episodes were compared with carbapenem-resistant, extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant, and fluoroquinolone-resistant episodes using CDC definitions. Predictors of DTR were identified. The adjusted relative risk (aRR) of mortality was examined for DTR, CDC-defined phenotypes susceptible to ≥1 first-line agent, and graded loss of active categories. Results Between 2009-2013, 471 (1%) of 45011 GNBSI episodes at 92 (53.2%) of 173 hospitals exhibited DTR, ranging from 0.04% for Escherichia coli to 18.4% for Acinetobacter baumannii. Among patients with DTR, 79% received parenteral aminoglycosides, tigecycline, or colistin/polymyxin-B; resistance to all aminoglycosides occurred in 33%. Predictors of DTR included urban healthcare and higher baseline illness. Crude mortality for GNBSIs with DTR was 43%; aRR was higher for DTR than for carbapenem-resistant (1.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-1.4; P = .02), extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant (1.2; 1.1-1.4; P = .001), or fluoroquinolone-resistant (1.2; 1.0-1.4; P = .008) infections. The mortality aRR increased 20% per graded loss of active first-line categories, from 3-5 to 1-2 to 0. Conclusion Nonsusceptibility to first-line antibiotics is associated with decreased survival in GNBSIs. DTR is a simple bedside prognostic measure of treatment-limiting coresistance.",7eiq31rx

Methods: Thirty-four COVID-19 patients diagnosed with RT-PCR in the isolation ward of the Fourth People's Hospital of Ningxia Hui autonomous region (infectious diseases hospital) from the January 22 to February 4, 2020 were selected as the research subjects. The clinical data were collected. Excel was used to describe the relationship between clinical classification and age distribution, contact history and date of onset. SPSS 25.0 statistical software was used for analysis. The general information, clinical symptoms, blood test, virus nucleic acid test results, epidemiology, CT imaging, treatment and prognosis were analyzed. Results: There were 5 mild cases (5/34), 24 ordinary cases (24/34), 5 severe cases (5/34). The elderly was more common in severe patients. The main clinical symptoms were fever (27/34)and dry cough(26/34). The peripheral blood showed normal or decreased leukocyte count (33/34), decreased lymphocyte count (12/34). The increase of C-reactive protein (CRP) and D-dimer was related to the severity of the disease. Some patients had mild liver and kidney damage. Six patients were diagnosed through 3 or more times of nucleic acid tests. Sixteen cases had Wuhan related history,13 cases were close contacts, 5 cases had no confirmed route. The clustered infections were found in 6 families. In typical cases, CT showed single or multiple patchy ground glass shadow with thickening of interlobular septum. In severe cases, diffuse lesions of both lungs were found, with ground glass shadow, consolidation shadow and strip shadow coexisting. Thirty-four patients were treated with interferon-α and Lopinavir/Ritonavir with good prognosis. Conclusions: The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 were similar to that of general viral pneumonia but with strong infectivity. Close contact and family aggregation caused disease outbreaks. COVID-19 could not be excluded if two nucleic acid tests were negative and high-resolution CT was helpful for differential diagnosis. Early detection, early isolation, early diagnosis and early treatment are important for good prognosis. The effectiveness of antiviral drugs needs to be further verified.",5w7ylcbr

Duodenojejunal bypass supports the foregut theory; however, its efficacy when used alone is not yet established. Methods During the period from January 2008 to December 2009, patients who underwent laparoscopic duodenojejunal bypass (LDJB) or laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with or without morbid obesity were included. Patients who had a follow-up for less than 3 years were excluded. Patient baseline characteristics, change of body weight, body mass index (BMI), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and diabetic treatments were analyzed. Results In total, 8 LDJB and 20 LRYGB patients were analyzed. The LDJB group had more number of male patients than the LRYGB group (LDJB 75% vs. LRYGB 30%, P = 0.030). Baseline BMI in the LRYGB group was higher than in the LDJB group (LDJB 27.0 ± 2.5 vs. LRYGB 32.6 ± 3.4, P < 0.001). Age, DM duration, baseline HbA1c, and C-peptide levels were similar. Longer operation time was needed to perform LDJB (LDJB 367.5 ± 120.2 vs. LRYGB 232.9 ± 41.1, P < 0.001), but no differences were observed in the hospital stay and complication rate between the 2 groups. At the third year of follow-up, the T2DM remission rate was observed in 40% of patients in the LRYGB group and 12.5% of patients in the LDJB group. Conclusion LDJB is not an effective method for controlling T2DM compared with LRYGB. Foregut theory may not be the main mechanism of diabetic control during bariatric surgery.",itco5qf0

The use of a rigid barrier disc (HeartShield™) has been suggested to offer protection against this lethal complication by preventing the heart from being drawn up by the negative pressure and damaged by the sharp sternum bone edges. Seven patients treated with conventional NPWT and seven patients treated with NPWT with a protective barrier disc (HeartShield) were compared with regard to bacterial clearance and infection parameters including C-reactive protein levels and leucocyte counts. C-reactive protein levels and leucocyte counts dropped faster and bacterial clearance occurred earlier in the HeartShield® group compared with the conventional NPWT group. Negative biopsy cultures were shown after 3·1 ± 0·4 NPWT dressing changes in the HeartShield group, and after 5·4 ± 0·6 NPWT dressing changes in the conventional NPWT group (P < 0·001). All patients were followed up with clinical check-up after 3 months. None of the patients in the HeartShield group had any signs of reinfection such as deep sternal wound infection (DSWI) or sternal fistulas, whereas in the conventional NPWT group, two patients had signs of sternal fistulas that demanded hospitalisation. HeartShield hinders the right ventricle to come into contact with the sharp sternal edges during NPWT and thereby protects from heart damage. This study shows that using HeartShield is beneficial in treating patients with DSWI. Improved wound healing by HeartShield may be a result of the efficient drainage of wound effluents from the thoracic cavity.",rwrtvsrm

We examined disability, quality of life, survival and acute care costs in the EXTEND-IA trial, which used CT-perfusion imaging selection. Methods Large vessel ischemic stroke patients with favorable CT-perfusion were randomized to endovascular thrombectomy after alteplase versus alteplase-only. Clinical outcome was prospectively measured using 90-day modified Rankin scale (mRS). Individual patient expected survival and net difference in Disability/Quality-adjusted life years (DALY/QALY) up to 15 years from stroke were modeled using age, sex, 90-day mRS, and utility scores. Level of care within the first 90 days was prospectively measured and used to estimate procedure and inpatient care costs (US$ reference year 2014). Results There were 70 patients, 35 in each arm, mean age 69, median NIHSS 15 (IQR 12-19). The median (IQR) disability-weighted utility score at 90 days was 0.65 (0.00-0.91) in the alteplase-only versus 0.91 (0.65-1.00) in the endovascular group (p = 0.005). Modeled life expectancy was greater in the endovascular versus alteplase-only group (median 15.6 versus 11.2 years, p = 0.02). The endovascular thrombectomy group had fewer simulated DALYs lost over 15 years [median (IQR) 5.5 (3.2-8.7) versus 8.9 (4.7-13.8), p = 0.02] and more QALY gained [median (IQR) 9.3 (4.2-13.1) versus 4.9 (0.3-8.5), p = 0.03]. Endovascular patients spent less time in hospital [median (IQR) 5 (3-11) days versus 8 (5-14) days, p = 0.04] and rehabilitation [median (IQR) 0 (0-28) versus 27 (0-65) days, p = 0.03]. The estimated inpatient costs in the first 90 days were less in the thrombectomy group (average US$15,689 versus US$30,569, p = 0.008) offsetting the costs of interhospital transport and the thrombectomy procedure (average US$10,515). The average saving per patient treated with thrombectomy was US$4,365. Conclusion Thrombectomy patients with large vessel occlusion and salvageable tissue on CT-perfusion had reduced length of stay and overall costs to 90 days.

Their tenuous walls predispose aneurysms to leak or rupture leading to hemorrhagic strokes with high morbidity and mortality rates. The endovascular treatment of cerebral aneurysms currently includes the implantation of fine-mesh stents, called flow diverters, within the parent artery bearing the aneurysm. By mitigating flow velocities within the aneurysmal sac, the devices preferentially induce thrombus formation in the aneurysm within hours to days. In response to the foreign implant, an endothelialized arterial layer covers the luminal surface of the device over a period of days to months. Organization of the intraneurysmal thrombus leads to resorption and shrinkage of the aneurysm wall and contents, eventually leading to beneficial remodeling of the pathological site to a near-physiological state. The devices' primary function of reducing flow activity within aneurysms is corollary to their mesh structure. Complete specification of the device mesh structure, or alternately device permeability, necessarily involves the quantification of two variables commonly used to characterize porous media-mesh porosity and mesh pore density. We evaluated the flow alteration induced by five commercial neurovascular devices of varying porosity and pore density (stents: Neuroform, Enterprise, and LVIS; flow diverters: Pipeline and FRED) in an idealized sidewall aneurysm model. As can be expected in such a model, all devices substantially reduced intraneurysmal kinetic energy as compared to the nonstented case with the coarse-mesh stents inducing a 65-80% reduction whereas the fine-mesh flow diverters induced a near-complete flow stagnation (∼98% reduction). We also note a trend toward greater device efficacy (lower intraneurysmal flow) with decreasing device porosity and increasing device pore density. Several such flow studies have been and are being conducted in idealized as well as patient-derived geometries with the overarching goals of improving device design, facilitating treatment planning (what is the optimal device for a specific aneurysm), and predicting treatment outcome (will a specific aneurysm treated with a specific device successfully occlude over the long term). While the results are generally encouraging, there is poor standardization of study variables between different research groups, and any consensus will only be reached after standardized studies are conducted on collectively large datasets. Biochemical variables may have to be incorporated into these studies to maximize predictive values.",18brxjuk

Numerous wearable technologies specific to physical activity and diet are available, but it is unclear if these are effective at improving weight loss. Objective To test the hypothesis that, compared with a standard behavioral weight loss intervention (standard intervention), a technology-enhanced weight loss intervention (enhanced intervention) would result in greater weight loss. Design, Setting, Participants Randomized clinical trial conducted at the University of Pittsburgh and enrolling 471 adult participants between October 2010 and October 2012, with data collection completed by December 2014. Interventions Participants were placed on a low-calorie diet, prescribed increases in physical activity, and had group counseling sessions. At 6 months, the interventions added telephone counseling sessions, text message prompts, and access to study materials on a website. At 6 months, participants randomized to the standard intervention group initiated self-monitoring of diet and physical activity using a website, and those randomized to the enhanced intervention group were provided with a wearable device and accompanying web interface to monitor diet and physical activity. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome of weight was measured over 24 months at 6-month intervals, and the primary hypothesis tested the change in weight between 2 groups at 24 months. Secondary outcomes included body composition, fitness, physical activity, and dietary intake. Results Among the 471 participants randomized (body mass index [BMI], 25 to <40; age range, 18-35 years; 28.9% nonwhite, 77.2% women), 470 (233 in the standard intervention group, 237 in the enhanced intervention group) initiated the interventions as randomized, and 74.5% completed the study. For the enhanced intervention group, mean base line weight was 96.3 kg (95% CI, 94.2-98.5) and 24-month weight 92.8 kg (95% CI, 90.6- 95.0) [corrected]. For the standard intervention group, mean baseline weight was 95.2kg (95%CI,93.0-97.3)and24-month weight was 89.3 kg (95%CI, 87.1-91.5) [corrected]. Weight change at 24 months differed significantly by intervention group (estimated mean weight loss, 3.5 kg [95% CI, 2.6-4.5} in the enhanced intervention group and 5.9 kg [95% CI, 5.0-6.8] in the standard intervention group; difference, 2.4 kg [95% CI, 1.0-3.7]; P = .002). Both groups had significant improvements in body composition, fitness, physical activity, and diet, with no significant difference between groups. Conclusions and Relevance Among young adults with a BMI between 25 and less than 40, the addition of a wearable technology device to a standard behavioral intervention resulted in less weight loss over 24 months. Devices that monitor and provide feedback on physical activity may not offer an advantage over standard behavioral weight loss approaches.

The installation of a food waste disposer (FWD) may increase the discharge of food waste (FW) into the wastewater; therefore, the installation of a FWD is discouraged in households that have a septic system. This study was conducted to determine how a typical dose of FW from a FWD can affect the performance of a septic system in terms of sewage treatment and solids accumulation. A 20-L control tank was compared with an experiment tank to which FW was added, increasing the amount of total suspended solids (TSS) by 31.3% and total chemical oxygen demands by 46.3% for a period of 110 days. Although the influent water quality changed dramatically, the effluent from the experiment tank had a substantially lower percentage increase in water quality parameters compared with the effluent from the control. It was found that in the experiment tank, 75.8% of FW TSS was degraded, whereas only 36.7% of sewage TSS was degraded, and that 18.8% of FW TSS and 44.9% of sewage TSS accumulated in the experiment tank. The addition of FW increased the scum accumulation, even though the dry matter of the scum layer was much less in quantity than the sludge layer. It also increased the lipid content in the sludge. The increase in the scum layer was mainly due to the increase in protein from the addition of the FW. Overall, compared with sewage TSS, FW TSS tends to be more biodegradable, which indicates that the impact on pumping frequency from adding FW will be insignificant.",lgcnzem2

METHOD Retrospective review of all adult asthma admissions to the Hospital CCC between 2000 and 2015. Demographic, physiological, treatment data and blood gas results were recorded. RESULTS There were 265 asthma admissions to Middlemore Hospital CCC during the study period. The median age was 34 years; 64% were female. NIV was used in 186 admissions, of which eight went on to require intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). Twenty-three other admissions received IMV without a trial of NIV and a further 58 were managed with medical care only. The average pH for all admissions was 7.23 and the IMV group had an average pH of 6.99. Forty-five admissions presented with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of ≤10. Twenty-five of these were managed with NIV with only one requiring subsequent intubation. The mean duration of NIV in this group was 5 h (range 1-17 h) with a mean ICU and hospital length of stay of 17 h and 3.5 days, respectively. All patients in this group effectively lowered the pCO2 over a 2 h period with NIV having an average drop of 5.9 kPa and IMV 3.4 kPa. CONCLUSION The use of NIV appears to be safe and effective in patients with severe asthma, including selected patients with an altered level of consciousness. NIV was well tolerated with a low need for subsequent intubation.",qkk2g77f

We describe our technique of two seperate total thoracoscopic segmentectomies by using a vessel sealing system (VSS). A 76-year old female with four gradually enlarging ground glass lesions on the right segment 2 (10 and 3 mm) and segment 6 (8 and 3 mm) was admitted to our institute for surgical diagnosis and treatment. Preoperative three-dimensional computed tomography showed that the A2 is composed of descending A2 and ascending A2, branch of V6 coursed to V2 and B1a originated from B2 and B1b from B3. Two separate segmentectomies were subsequently scheduled. Pulmonary vessel division was performed with VSS after proximal ligation. Intersegmental division by VSS and electrocautery was performed with the use of inflation-deflation demarcation line and the pulmonary veins along the intersegmental plane (V2a and V2c for segment 2 and V6b and V6c for segment 6) as guides to confirm the intersegmental plane after pulmonary artery and bronchial divisions. The intraoperative frozen-section examinations revealed adenocarcinoma in situ. Two separate segmentectomies were successfully completed, with a total operative time of 240 min and blood loss of 30 ml. VSS is a very useful and safe device for intersegmental division and pulmonary vessel division.",14835wpi

The 2014 update of the Canadian Secondary Prevention of Stroke guideline is a comprehensive summary of current evidence-based recommendations for clinicians in a range of settings, who provide care to patients following stroke. Notable changes in this 5th edition include an emphasis on treating the highest risk patients who present within 48 h of symptom onset with transient or persistent motor or speech symptoms, who need to be transported to the closest emergency department with capacity for advanced stroke care; a recommendation for brain and vascular imaging (of the intra- and extracranial vessels) to be completed urgently using computed tomography/computed tomography angiography; prolonged cardiac monitoring for patients with suspective cardioembolic stroke but without evidence for atrial fibrillation on electrocardiogram or holter monitoring; and de-emphasizing the need for routine echocardiogram. The Canadian Stroke Best Practice Recommendations include a range of supporting materials such as implementation resources to facilitate the adoption of evidence to practice, and related performance measures to enable monitoring of uptake and effectiveness of the recommendations using a standardized approach. The guidelines further emphasize the need for a systems approach to stroke care, involving an interprofessional team, with access to specialists regardless of patient location, and the need to overcome geographical barriers to ensure equity in access within a universal health-care system.",m5xpfaw5

Total pericardiectomy is the most effective treatment and is traditionally performed via median sternotomy. With the increasing use of minimally invasive techniques, there have been reports of partial pericardiectomy via thoracoscopy but with suboptimal exposure and difficulty identifying both phrenic nerves. Robotic surgery offers both small incisions and enhanced visualization. We present four cases of robotic endoscopic off-pump total pericardiectomy for constrictive pericarditis. METHODS Four patients underwent off-pump total pericardiectomy with robotic assistance for constrictive pericarditis. All had constrictive physiology demonstrated by right heart catheterization and/or echocardiogram. One was also found to have coronary artery disease and underwent concurrent totally endoscopic coronary artery bypass grafting left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery. Ports were placed in the left second, fourth, and sixth intercostal spaces. The left lung was isolated and deflated with CO2 insufflation, aiding in exposure. With the use of electrocautery, the pericardium was removed first posterior to the left phrenic nerve, then anteriorly all the way to the right phrenic nerve, and caudally from the diaphragmatic reflection to the great vessel cephalad. A stabilizer in the subcostal fourth robotic arm was used to assist in the dissection. RESULTS Two of four patients were extubated within 6 hours after surgery and transferred to the floor on postoperative day 1. Both were discharged home by postoperative day 5. Two of four patients had preoperative sequelae from chronic constriction and necessitated longer hospital and intensive care unit stays but had improvement in symptoms and were discharged home within 3 weeks. CONCLUSIONS Total pericardiectomy for constrictive pericarditis can be performed using a robotic approach. In contrast to thoracoscopy, it offers better visualization of both phrenic nerves, avoids injury, and allows a thorough pericardial dissection. In our experience, the robotic left chest approach has proven more efficacious in removing the posterior pericardium than is allowed with median sternotomy.",gdbeeknh

Wear and corrosion of these implants can lead to local and systemic transport of metal debris. This prospective longitudinal study examined the serum chromium and cobalt levels in 24 patients with cobalt-chromium alloy metal-on-metal lumbar disc replacements. METHODS Serum was assayed for chromium (Cr) and cobalt (Co) using high-resolution inductively-coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Detection limits were 0.015 ng/mL for Cr and 0.04 ng/mL for Co. RESULTS Median serum Co levels at pre-op, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36-months post-op were 0.10, 1.03, 0.96, 0.98, 0.67, and 0.52 ng/mL, respectively. Median serum Cr levels were 0.06, 0.49, 0.65, 0.43, 0.52, and 0.50 ng/mL, respectively. CONCLUSION In general, these results indicated that serum Co and Cr levels are elevated at all postoperative time points and are of the same order of magnitude as those observed in well-functioning metal-on-metal surface replacements of the hip and in metal-on-metal total hip replacements at similar postoperative time points.",lmcf0xsb
